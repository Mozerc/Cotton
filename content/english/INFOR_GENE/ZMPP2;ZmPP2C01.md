## Functions:
   - The deduced amino acid sequence of ZMPP2 contains the five PP2C signature domains, as does PDP. However, the expression pattern of ZMPP2, determined by reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction, was different from those of the maize pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.
   - The predicted subcellular location of ZMPP2 is cytoplasmic, while the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, regulated by reversible phosphorylation, is mitochondrial. Thus, ZMPP2 is a PP2C‐type protein phosphatase related to but distinct from PDP.
   - Expression of the ZMPP2 mRNA in various maize organs was determined using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction.
