## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/)
- **Gene Symbol:** FaTPK1
- **Gene Name:** two-pore potassium channel 1-like
- **NCBI ID:** [LOC101294428](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=LOC101294428)
- **Genome Version:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria x ananassa*

## Functions:
   - **FaTPK1** increased rapidly and was maintained at a high level in ripened fruit, which was coupled with the fruit's red colour development, suggesting that **FaTPK1** is related to fruit quality formation.
   - The potassium channel **FaTPK1** plays a critical role in fruit quality formation in strawberry.
   - Altered **FaTPK1** expression affects the ripening-related physiological processes.
