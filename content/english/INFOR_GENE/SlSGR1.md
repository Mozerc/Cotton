## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc08g080090](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Solyc08g080090)
- **Gene Symbol:** SlSGR1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Solanum lycopersicum
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [tomato genome sequence SL4.0]()

## Functions:
   - SlWRKY53 and SlSGR1 were identified as direct transcriptional targets of SlWRKY37 during leaf senescence and were both expressed during dark-induced leaf senescence.
   - As observed for dark-induced senescence, the transcript levels of SlSAG12, senescence regulated-genes (SlWRKY53), and the chlorophyll degradation gene SlSGR1 were up-regulated.
   - SlWRKY37 directly regulates the transcription of SlWRKY53 and SlSGR1.
