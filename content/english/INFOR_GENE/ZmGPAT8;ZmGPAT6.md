- **Gene Name:** glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - Our study revealed that ZmGPAT14, along with ZmGPAT7, ZmGPAT8, and ZmGPAT13, had relatively high levels of transcripts at early seed developmental stages and peaked at 5 DAF, suggesting their possible roles in oil production and seed development in maize.
   - ZmGPAT8 and ZmGPAT11 were regulated by cold and heat stresses
   - The transcripts of ZmGPAT7, ZmGPAT8, ZmGPAT13, and ZmGPAT14 all peaked at the early stage of seed development (5DAF) and maintained high levels of transcription at the middle seed developmental stages (15–20 DAF), which might imply their potential roles in maize seed development and oil production.
