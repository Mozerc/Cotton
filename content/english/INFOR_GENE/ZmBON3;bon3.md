## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb285200](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb285200)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmBON3;bon3
- **Gene Name:** bonzai3
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - It was found that ZmBON3 may be involved in the related defense processes mediated by the R gene, SA pathway, JA pathway, and ABA pathway.
   - The disease resistance of gene-edited plants was significantly increased, which verified that the ZmBON3 gene was a negative regulatory gene.
   - ZmBON3-geneedited plants showed obvious dwarf phenomenon at the seedling stage, but this did not affect the ear length, axis diameter, ear row number, and grain color.
