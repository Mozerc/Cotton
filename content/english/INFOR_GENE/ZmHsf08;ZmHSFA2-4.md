## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb100770](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb100770)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmHsf08;ZmHSFA2-4;hsftf1
- **Gene Name:** HSF-transcription factor 1
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()

## Functions:
   - ZmHsf08 was highly homologous to SbHsfB1, BdHsfB1, and OsHsfB1, and has no transcriptional activation activity. The expression profiles demonstrated that ZmHsf08 was differentially expressed in various organs of maize and was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
   - The overexpression of ZmHsf08 in maize resulted in enhanced sensitivity to salt and drought stresses, displaying lower survival rates, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) contents compared with wild-type (WT) plants.
   - ZmHsf08 negatively regulates a number of stress/ABA-responsive genes under salt and drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that ZmHsf08 plays a negative role in response to salt and drought stresses in maize.
