## Functions:
   - XLGs play roles in maize and rice growth, development, and stress responses. XLGs regulate agronomic traits such as plant height, tiller and panicle number, heading time, and grain size/shape, and affect tolerance of both abiotic and biotic stresses; combined knockout of three XLGs can lead to seedling lethality.
   - XLGs have both redundant and specific roles in the control of agronomically relevant plant architecture and resistance to both abiotic and biotic stresses.
   - ZmXLG1 mutant knockout has reduced plant height; triple mutants are lethal at the seedling stage.
