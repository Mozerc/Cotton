## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb075080](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb075080)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmTH02.1;thx32;
- **Gene Name:** Trihelix-transcription factor 32
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - Trihelix transcription factors play important roles in triggering plant growth and imparting tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, a systematical analysis of the trihelix transcription factor family under heat and drought stresses in maize has not been reported.
   - The conserved domain of ZmTHs was GT1 or Myb_DNA-bind_4, which was a typical triple helix structure. Five proteins in the GT-2 subfamily contained two triple helix structures, while the remaining had only one.
   - The highest proportion of conformations were the random coil and α-helix with an average of 90.51%. Among these two typical conformations, ZmTH02.1 had the highest percentage of 97.11%, and ZmTH09.1 had the lowest percentage, occupying 81.53%.
