## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[GRMZM2G154414](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/GRMZM2G154414)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmICK8;KRP3;cki8
- **Gene Name:** cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor8
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - ZmICK8 is unique compared with the other seven ZmICK genes. ZmICK8 also has unique characteristics in terms of genetic structure and conserved motifs.
   - The cloned ZmICK8 contained an insertion element, which results in early termination of translation and loss of the conserved CDI region. We cloned the ZmICK8 genes from three other inbred lines and found the same early termination insertion.
   - As the conserved C-terminal region is required for CDK-inhibiting function16, ZmICK8 is considered a pseudo member of the maize ICK/KRP family, similar to OsICK7. OsICK7 lacks the conserved C-terminal CDK- and cyclin-binding region but shares similarities with other rice ICK/KRP sequences in the N-terminal region8 and is also considered a pseudogene.
