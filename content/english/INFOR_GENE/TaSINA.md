## Functions:
   - Near isogenic lines carrying the positive allele at qYDH.3BL underexpressed TaSINA and had increased vigour and water use efficiency early in development.
   - TaSINA might be a negative regulator of plant growth adaptation under heat.
   - TaSINA and had increased vigour and water use efficiency early in development, as well as increased biomass, grain number, and grain weight following heat stress.
