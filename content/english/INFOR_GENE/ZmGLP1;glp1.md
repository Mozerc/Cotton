## Functions:
   - A gene encoding a protein similar to germin-like proteins (GLPs) was obtained from maize (Zea mays) and designated as ZmGLP1. Based on the ZmGLP1 conserved domain and phylogenetic status, ZmGLP1 was grouped into GLP subfamily b and has high similarity to OsGLP8-14 from Oryza sativa.
   - ZmGLP1 is expressed in different maize tissues during different growth stages and is mainly expressed in the stems and leaves. The induced expression patterns confirmed that ZmGLP1 is differentially expressed under abiotic and hormone stress.
   - We speculate that ZmGLP1 plays an important role in the regulation of Arabidopsis resistance to biotrophic PstDC3000 and necrotrophic S. sclerotiorum; the regulatory effects are achieved by inducing plant oxidative burst activity and activation of the JA signaling pathway.
