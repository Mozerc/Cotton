- **Gene Symbol:** BnFLC.C2
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Brassica napus
- **NCBI ID:** [ KY964573 ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [B. napus reference genome Darmor v4.1]()

## Functions:
   - A 2.833-kb Insertion in BnFLC.A2 and Its Homeologous Exchange with BnFLC.C2 during Breeding Selection Generated Early-Flowering Rapeseed.
   - BnFLC.A2 and BnFLC.C2 are the causal genes of qFlowering Time-A2 and qFlowering Time-C2.
   - BnaA02g00370D (hereafter as BnFLC.A2) and BnaC02g00490D (hereafter as BnFLC.C2) are most likely to be the target genes of qFlowering Time-A2 and qFlowering Time-C2.
