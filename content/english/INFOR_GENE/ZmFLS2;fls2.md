## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb256000](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb256000)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmFLS2;fls2
- **Gene Name:** flavonol synthase2
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - The analysis shows that FLS neighboring genes are conserved in maize (ZmFLS1, ZmFLS2), rice (OsFLS1), Brachypodium (BdFLS1), and sorghum (SbFLS1, with the exception of SbFLS2 gene); however, some re-arrangements among blocks of linked genes are observed as well as inversions, duplication, and deletions of certain genes, particularly in maize.
   - Both ZmFLS1 and ZmFLS2 showed higher expression in BMSC1+R than in BMS cells, suggesting that both genes are also under the control of the C1 and R anthocyanin regulators.
   - ZmFLS2 would be able to complement the A. thaliana fls1 mutants similarly as ZmFLS1. These proteins show only two differences in their amino acid sequences at positions not participating in 2-oxoglutarate and substrate binding, or the coordination of the ferrous iron necessary for the enzyme activity.
