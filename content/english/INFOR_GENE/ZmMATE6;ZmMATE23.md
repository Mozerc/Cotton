## Functions:
   - ZmMATE6 is another member of this family in maize whose expression is also increased by Al treatment. We investigated the function of this gene in more detail to determine whether it also contributes to Al resistance.
   - Treatment with Al induced ZmMATE6 expression in all tissues but several other divalent or trivalent cations tested had no effect on expression. This expression pattern and the induction by Al treatment was confirmed in ZmMATE6 promoter–β-glucuronidase fusion lines.
   - Heterogeneous expression of ZmMATE6 displayed a greater Al-activated release of citrate from the roots and was significantly resistant to Al toxicity than controls. This was associated with reduced accumulation of Al in the root tissues.
