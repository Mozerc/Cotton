## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/)
- **Gene Symbol:** UGT91Q2
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Camellia sinensis
- **NCBI ID:** [ XM_028211228 ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** []()

## Functions:
   - Sesquiterpene glucosylation mediated by glucosyltransferase UGT91Q2 is involved in the modulation of cold stress tolerance in tea plants.
   - UGT (UGT91Q2) in tea plant, whose expression is strongly induced by cold stress and which specifically catalyzes the glucosylation of nerolidol.
   - Down-regulation of UGT91Q2 resulted in reduced accumulation of nerolidol glucoside, ROS scavenging capacity and tea plant cold tolerance.
