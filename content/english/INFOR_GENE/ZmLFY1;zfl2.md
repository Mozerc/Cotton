## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb071990](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb071990)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmLFY1;zfl2
- **Gene Name:** Zea floricaula leafy2
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - zfl1 and zfl2 double mutants exhibit a disruption of floral organ identity and patterning, as well as defects in inflorescence architecture and in the vegetative to reproductive phase transition.
   - Despite overlap in traits associated with these duplicate genes, zfl1 showed stronger associations with flowering time, while zfl2 associated more strongly with branching and inflorescence structure traits, suggesting some divergence of function.
   - The results suggest that zfl2 activity is important for the QTL effect, supporting zfl2 as a candidate gene for a role in morphological evolution of maize.
