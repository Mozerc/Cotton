## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb268840](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb268840)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmXLG3b;xlg3
- **Gene Name:** extra-large guanine nucleotide-binding protein3
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - ZmXLG3b,encoding a guanine nucleotide‐binding protein predicted to be involved in the response to desiccation, was previously found to be downregulated in the drought‐tolerant H082183 line but upregulated in the drought‐susceptible maize line Lv28 under severe drought stress versus control conditions.
   - ZmXLG3b was identified as a candidate drought stress response gene in a GWAS study on 300 inbred maize lines, and its expression level was found to anticorrelate with drought stress tolerance levels in four tested maize lines.
