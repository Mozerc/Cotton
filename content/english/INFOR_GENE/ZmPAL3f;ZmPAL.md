## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb185250](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb185250)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmPAL3f;ZmPAL;PAL1;PAL5
- **Gene Name:** phenylalanine ammonia lyase5
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - Three genes (ZmPAL1, ZmPAL2, and ZmPAL5) were strongly expressed in all three maize lines, in both nematode-infected and noninfected roots, between 2 and 16 d after inoculation.
   - The genes ZmPAL1, ZmPAL2, ZmPAL4, and ZmPAL5 were expressed in the roots of infected and noninfected maize at each sample time (0 to 16 DAI). ZmPAL3 was not detected in the roots and ZmPAL6 was found expressed in the leaves but not in the roots (data not shown).
   - These observations are consistent with at least one PAL gene playing a role in modulating host status of maize toward M. incognita and suggest a need for additional research to further elucidate this association.
