## Functions:
   - The drought response-related MBS element was present in the ZmG6PDH4 and ZmG6PDH5 promoter regions.
   - the stress and defense response-related TC-rich repeat element was observed in the ZmG6PDH1, ZmG6PDH2, and ZmG6PDH4 promoters, and the cold-responsive LTR element was observed in the ZmG6PDH1, ZmG6PDH2, ZmG6PDH4, and ZmG6PDH5 promoters.
   - All these ZmG6PDH promoters contained at least one hormone-responsive cis-acting element, such as the ABA-responsive element (ABRE) and gibberellin-responsive element (GARE).
