- **Gene Symbol:** LBL1;rgd1
- **Gene Name:** ragged seedling1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Here, we address the role of LEAFBLADELESS1 (**LBL1**), a component of maize trans-acting short-interfering RNA (ta-siRNA), in maize root development. We report that root growth, anatomical patterning, and the number of lateral roots (LRs), monocot-specific crown roots (CRs) and seminal roots (SRs) are significantly affected in **lbl1**-rgd1 mutant, which is defective in production of ta-siRNA, including tasiR-ARF that targets AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3) in maize.
   - Thus, **LBL1**/ta-siRNA module regulates root development, possibly by affecting auxin distribution and signalling, in crosstalk with miR165/166-RLD1/2 module. We further show that **ZmLBL1** and its Arabidopsis homologue AtSGS3 proteins are functionally conserved.
   - We further studied the expression levels of cell cycle regulators ZmCycB1, ZmCycD2, ZmCycD3 and ZmCycD4, and found that these genes were upregulated in **lbl1**-rgd1 PR tip (0-1cm) when compared with wild type(Hu et al., 2010). These results suggest that increased cell division activity contributes to the increase in root meristem size, and thus longer PR, in **lbl1**-rgd1.
   - Thus, our results showed that **LBL1** is able to rescue the leaf and root developmental defects of sgs3-11, possibly by restoring functional tasiR-ARF production in sgs3-11/- (pAtSGS3:Zm**LBL1**) plants. This indicates functional conservation of the **LBL1**- and SGS3-mediated ta-siRNA pathways between dicots and monocots.
