## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/)
- **Gene Symbol:** VAHOX1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Solanum lycopersicum
- **NCBI ID:** [ NP_001234250 ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** []()

## Functions:
   - A tomato HD-zip I transcription factor, VAHOX1, acts as a negative regulator of fruit ripening.
   - VAHOX1, a member of the tomato HD-Zip I subfamily, was expressed in all tissues, was highly expressed in breaker+4 fruits, and could be induced by ethylene. RNAi repression of VAHOX1 (VAHOX1-RNAi) resulted in accelerated fruit ripening, enhanced sensitivity to ethylene.
   - VAHOX1 affects ethylene sensitivity in tomato.
