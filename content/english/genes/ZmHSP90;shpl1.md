## Functions:
   - Maize ZmHSP90 plays a role in acclimation to salt stress.
   - a significant finding has been made indicating that when exposed to high levels of salt stress, the expression of ZmHSP90 in ‘975-12’ increased while in ‘GEMS64’ decreased. Furthermore, in tobacco plants overexpressing ZmHSP90, there was an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity associated with salt tolerance.
   - ZmHSP90 enhanced the expression levels of NtSOS1, NtHKT1, and NtNHX1 as compared to those in the salt treatment, causing the maintenance of Na+ and K+ homeostasis, suggesting that high expression of ZmHSP90 was conducive to regulate Na+ transporters to maintain K+/Na+ balanced in tobacco.
