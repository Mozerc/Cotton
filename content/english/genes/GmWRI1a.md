## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma15g34770](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Glyma15g34770)
- **Gene Symbol:** GmWRI1a
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome Version:** [glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Description:
   - **GmWRI1a** is the functional counterpart of WRI1, whereas GmWRI1b exhibited reduced function in modulating seed oil biosynthesis.
   - **GmWRI1a**/GmWRI1b and GmLEC1a/GmLEC1b are considered to be two homoeologous pairs formed by the ~13-mya WGD event (Figure S2), which are likely to be the orthologs of the Arabidopsis WRI1 and LEC1.
   - **GmWRI1a**/GmWRI1b, GmLEC1a/GmLEC1b, and GmABI3a/GmABI3b homoeologous pairs showed very similar evolutionary rates as reflected by non-synonymous substitution rates (Ks), synonymous substitution rates (Ka), and their ratios (Ï‰), suggesting that the two members of each of the three duplicated gene pairs have experienced similar intensities of purifying selection.
