## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb219160](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb219160)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmSnRK2.10;ZmSnRK2.8;ZmOST1-1;snrkII10
- **Gene Name:** SnRK2 serine threonine kinase10
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - ZmSnRK2.10, which belongs to subclass III, is highly expressed in kernel and activated by ABA. Overexpression of ZmSnRK2.10 partially rescued the ABA-insensitive phenotype of snrk2.2/2.3 double and snrk2.2/2.3/2.6 triple mutants and led to delaying plant flowering in Arabidopsis.
   - Overexpression of ZmSnRK2.10 could partially complement the phenotype of Atsnrk2.2/2.3, Atsnrk2.2/2.3/2.6 mutants and delay the flowering time in Arabidopsis. This study will enhance our understanding of the SnRK2 gene family and provide insights into the functional diversity of SnRK2 genes in maize.
   - ZmSnRK2.10 was highly expressed during the development of kernel, especially in the 10 DAP (days after pollination) and 24 DAP of kernel development, the stage of which is very important for grain filling and seed maturation.
