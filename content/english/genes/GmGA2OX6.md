## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.13G259400](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Glyma.13G259400)
- **Gene Symbol:** GmGA2OX6
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Glycine max
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1]()

## Functions:
   - Suggesting that GmGA2OX6 may delay flowering, similar to its Arabidopsis ortholog GA2OX. However, further work is needed to test how each of these genes and the alleles described here affect flowering time in cultivated soybean.
   - GmGA2OX6 regulates photoperiodic flowering time
   - GmGA2OX6 regulates photoperiodic days to maturity
