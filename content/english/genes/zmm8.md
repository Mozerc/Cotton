- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb400120](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb400120)
- **Gene Symbol:** zmm8
- **Gene Name:** Zea mays MADS8
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()

## Functions:
   - Here we report the cDNA cloning of a pair of MADS box genes, ZMM8 and ZMM14, from the monocotyledonous plant maize.
   - Although upper and lower florets develop in a very similar way in male inflorescences, ZMM8 and ZMM14 expression was found in all organs of upper florets, but no transcripts were detected in lower florets. In contrast, two other MADS box genes were found to be expressed in lower florets in the same way as in upper florets.
   - Our observations suggest that during spikelet development ZMM8 and ZMM14 work as selector genes which are involved in distinguishing the upper from the lower floret.
