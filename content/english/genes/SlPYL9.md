## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc09g015380](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Solyc09g015380)
- **Gene Symbol:** SlPYL9
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Solanum lycopersicum
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [reference to-mato genome release SL2.50]()

## Functions:
   - in the SlPYL9-RNAi lines, fruit ripening was delayed, mesocarp thickness was enhanced, and the petals did not abscise as timely as the WT, resulting in conical / oblong and gourd-shaped fruit. These results suggest that SlPYL9 is involved in ABA signaling, thereby playing a role in the regulation of flower abscission and fruit ripening in tomato.
