## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb430240](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb430240)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmLFY2;zfl1
- **Gene Name:** zea floricaula/leafy1
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - zfl1 and zfl2 double mutants exhibit a disruption of floral organ identity and patterning, as well as defects in inflorescence architecture and in the vegetative to reproductive phase transition.
   - Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the trends associated with zfl1 genotype in the segregating populations require zfl1 activity rather than being caused by segregation of a linked gene or genes.
   - Despite overlap in traits associated with these duplicate genes, zfl1 showed stronger associations with flowering time, while zfl2 associated more strongly with branching and inflorescence structure traits, suggesting some divergence of function.
