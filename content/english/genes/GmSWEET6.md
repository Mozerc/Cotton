## Functions:
   - GmSWEET6, was functionally characterised in soybean, and its role in AM symbiosis was investigated via transgenic plants.
   - GmSWEET6 mainly transported sucrose.
   - Overexpression or knockdown of GmSWEET6 decreased plant dry weight, P content, and sugar concentrations in non-mycorrhizal plants, which were partly recovered in mycorrhizal plants.
   - GmSWEET6 is required for AM symbiosis by mediating sucrose efflux towards fungi.
