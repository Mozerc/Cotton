- **Gene Symbol:** GmMLRK1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Glycine max
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()

## Functions:
   - A novel soybean malectin-like receptor kinase-encoding gene, GmMLRK1, provides resistance to soybean mosaic virus.
   - GmMLRK1 encodes a malectin-like receptor kinase (RK) that was induced earlier and to a greater degree in leaves of the SMV-resistant cultivar Kefeng No. 1 than in those of the susceptible cultivar Nannong 1138-2 after inoculation.
   - GmMLRK1 knockout mutants were more susceptible to both pathotypes.
