## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb304160](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb304160)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmLAZ1-5;laz5
- **Gene Name:** lazarus ortholog5
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - The expression of ZmLAZ1-5 and -8 was significantly induced by cold stress. Under UV treatment, the expression of ZmLAZ1-2, -3, -5 and -8 was significantly upregulated. These results suggested that ZmLAZ1 s might play a role in the growth, development and stress response.
   - The paralogs of ZmLAZ1-3 and ZmLAZ1-4, ZmLAZ1-4 and ZmLAZ1-5 were duplicated by purifying selection 79.65 and 131.56 million years ago (Mya), respectively, but ZmLA1-3 and ZmLAZ1-5 was duplicated by diversifying selectin 127.06 million years ago.
