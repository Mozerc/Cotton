## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc04g056390](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Solyc04g056390)
- **Gene Symbol:** SlIDI1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Solanum lycopersicum
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [tomato genome sequence SL4.0]()

## Functions:
   - The expression of SlIDI1 was highest in flowers and fruit and increased with fruit ripening or flower maturation.
   - In SlIDI1 mutant fruit, SlBCH1 transcription involved in β-carotenoid catabolism was obviously suppressed, which may be responsible for the higher β-carotene-to-lycopene ratio and suggested potential feedback regulatory mechanisms involved in carotenoid pathway flux.
   - SlIDI1 is predicted to target chloroplasts, while SlIDI2 is likely to be localized in the cytoplasm.

   - [Alternative transcription and feedback regulation suggest that SlIDI1 is involved in tomato carotenoid synthesis in a complex way.]( https://academic.oup.com/hr/article/doi/10.1093/hr/uhab045/6498066?login=true ) - [10.1093/hr/uhab045]( https://academic.oup.com/hr/article/doi/10.1093/hr/uhab045/6498066?login=true ) - [35031800](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35031800/)
