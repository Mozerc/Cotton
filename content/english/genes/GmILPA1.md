- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.11G026400.1](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Glyma.11G026400.1)
- **Gene Symbol:** GmILPA1
- **Gene Name:** Increased Leaf Petiole Angle1
- **Species:** Glycine max
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Williams 82 reference genome]()

## Functions:
   - Functional characterization of Glycine max Increased Leaf Petiole Angle1 (GmILPA1), a gene encoding an APC8-like protein, which is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome in soybean (Glycine max). 
   - GmILPA1 is mainly expressed in the basal cells of leaf primordia and appears to function by promoting cell growth and division of the pulvinus that is critical for its establishment.
   - GmILPA1 directly interacts with GmAPC13a as part of the putative anaphase-promoting complex. GmILPA1 exhibits variable expression levels among varieties with different degrees of LPAs, and expression levels are correlated with the degrees of the LPAs.
