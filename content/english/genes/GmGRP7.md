## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.11G117400](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Glyma.11G117400)
- **Gene Symbol:** GmGRP7
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Glycine max
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Williams 82 genome]()

## Functions:
   - As a direct activator of GmSPCH and GmGRP7, which are potentially associated with asymmetric division of young epidermal cells and stomatal opening.
   - The degree of change in GmDREB1D, GmSPCH, and GmGRP7 expression in response to the stress.
   - Modifying the Dt2-binding sites in the promoter regions of GmSPCH and GmGRP7 would reduce the expression levels of these two genes.
