## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb176800](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb176800)
- **Gene Symbol:** Bt2;agpsen;glt1;adp3
- **Gene Name:** brittle endosperm2
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Sequence annotation showed that the BRITTLE ENDOSPERM2 (**Bt2**) gene, previously reported to be involved in maize kernel development, was located in this region. Maize **Bt2** gene encoded the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), the first rate-limiting enzyme in the starch biosynthetic pathway of higher plants.
   - We confirmed that 5601Q was a new allele mutant of **Bt2** by allelic test of **Bt2** mutant 1774 and 5601Q. Sequencing analysis revealed that Mutator 19 transposon was inserted in the 2nd exon of **Bt2** gene. In summary, our results indicated that the shrunken kernel in 5601Q was caused by the loss-of-function of **Bt2** gene, which provided a new germplasm resource to elucidate the mechanism of maize **Bt2** gene in endosperm storage substance accumulation.
