## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.19G203300](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Glyma.19G203300)
- **Gene Symbol:** RPS28
- **Gene Name:** 40S RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN SMALL SUBUNIT S28
- **Genome Version:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Description:
   - Our results indicate the potential of **RPS28** and EIF1 promoters to facilitate future genetic engineering and breeding to improve the quality and yield of soybean, as well as in a wide variety of other plant species.
   - Two FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) homologs, FT2a and FT5a, have been identified as encoding components of florigen and controlling flowering time in soybean . The expression levels of these two genes are down-regulated by E1, E2, E3, and E4 under long-day (LD) conditions, suggesting that FT2a and FT5a are the major soybean flowering regulation targets . Subsequent studies have shown that E9 is FT2a, with a Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon SORE-1 inserted in its first intron in its recessive allele.
