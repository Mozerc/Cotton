## Functions:
   - Sequence annotation showed that the BRITTLE ENDOSPERM2 (Bt2) gene, previously reported to be involved in maize kernel development, was located in this region. Maize Bt2 gene encoded the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), the first rate-limiting enzyme in the starch biosynthetic pathway of higher plants.
   - We confirmed that 5601Q was a new allele mutant of Bt2 by allelic test of Bt2 mutant 1774 and 5601Q. Sequencing analysis revealed that Mutator 19 transposon was inserted in the 2nd exon of Bt2 gene. In summary, our results indicated that the shrunken kernel in 5601Q was caused by the loss-of-function of Bt2 gene, which provided a new germplasm resource to elucidate the mechanism of maize Bt2 gene in endosperm storage substance accumulation.
