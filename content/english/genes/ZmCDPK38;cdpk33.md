## Functions:
   - ZmCDPK38 protein contains four classical conserved domains of CDPK family member indicating its protein kinase characters. And the transcriptional analysis demonstrated that the expression of ZmCDPK38 gene was induced in response to drought and salt stress, suggesting that it may play a role in the regulation of drought and salt tolerance.
   - ZmCDPK38 protein contained four classical conserved domains of CDPK family member, including Ser/Thr protein kinase domains.
   - ZmCDPK38 gene was expressed in a tissue-specific manner, which showed high expression level in maize leaves and less mRNA accumulation in stem, root, ear and tassel.
