## Functions:
   - Regulation of tomato fruit elongation by transcription factor BZR1.7 through promotion of SUN gene expression.
   - A unique BZR1-like transcription factor, BZR1.7, was identified as a trans-acting factor of the SUN gene promoter that bound to the conserved E-box of the promoter to promote SUN gene expression.
   - Overexpression of BZR1.7 in tomato led to elevated SUN gene expression and formation of elongated fruits.
