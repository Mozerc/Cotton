- **Gene Symbol:** ZmPEAMT;peamt1
- **Gene Name:** phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase1
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()

## Functions:
   - Phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT), a key enzyme for betaine synthesis, is reported to be regulated by its upstream promoter. In the present investigation, by using the transgenic approach, a 1048 bp long promoter region of ZmPEAMT gene from Zea mays was cloned and functionally characterized in tobacco.
   - The T1 generation transgenic tobacco plants possessing a single copy of the transgene were assessed for GUS expression under control and stressful regimes including salt, drought, cold and oxidative stress for determining the optimal length of the ZmPEAMT promoter for achieving effective gene expression.
   - ZmPEAMT gene promoter, as a stress-inducible promoter, may be used to biological engineering for solving the problem caused by abiotic stress in different plants that might provide staple food crops.
