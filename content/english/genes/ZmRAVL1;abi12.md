- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - UPA2 is controlled by a two-base sequence polymorphism regulating the expression of a B3-domain transcription factor (**ZmRAVL1**) located 9.5 kilobases downstream.
   - UPA2 exhibits differential binding by DRL1 (DROOPING LEAF1), and DRL1 physically interacts with LG1 (LIGULELESS1) and represses LG1 activation of **ZmRAVL1**.
   - **ZmRAVL1** regulates brd1 (brassinosteroid C-6 oxidase1), which underlies UPA1, altering endogenous brassinosteroid content and leaf angle.
   - The UPA2 allele that reduces leaf angle originated from teosinte, the wild ancestor of maize, and has been lost during maize domestication. Introgressing the wild UPA2 allele into modern hybrids and editing **ZmRAVL1** enhance high-density maize yields.
   - In **ZmRAVL1**-knockout plants, brd1 expression was down-regulated, whereas in brd1-overexpressed lines, **ZmRAVL1** exhibited no change.
   - The two NILs for UPA2 differed in brd1 expression, whereas **ZmRAVL1** showed similar expression in the two NILs for UPA1. These results suggested that brd1 functions downstream of **ZmRAVL1**. These results indicate that **ZmRAVL1** functions as a positive regulator of maize leaf angle.
   - Brassinolide was not detected in our samples. Plants with brd1 overexpression exhibited increased castasterone content. **ZmRAVL1**-knockout plants that showed reduced brd1 expression had less castasterone than did wild-type plants. These results suggested that **ZmRAVL1** affects endogenous brassinosteroid content.
