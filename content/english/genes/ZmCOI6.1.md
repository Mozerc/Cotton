## Functions:
   - ZmCOI6.1, a novel, alternatively spliced maize gene, whose transcript level changes under abiotic stress.
   - Analysis of the ZmCOI6.1 promoter sequence revealed several conserved stress-responsive cis-acting elements. Further characterization of expression showed that ZmCOI6.1 was induced not only by cold, but also by drought and salinity as well as by the signaling molecules abscisic acid and salicylic acid, indicating that ZmCOI6.1 is a stress-responsive gene.
   - ZmCOI6.1 is alternatively spliced and yields two transcripts, the level of which change depending on the stress, indicating a possible mechanism of regulation at the splicing level. Constitutive expression of ZmCOI6.1 in Arabidopsis yielded plants that were less tolerant to abiotic stress, providing evidence that ZmCOI6.1 may be a negative regulator.
