## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb060200](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb060200)
- **Gene Symbol:** VP8
- **Gene Name:** iviparous8
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - VP8 is mainly expressed in the stem apex, young leaves, and developing vascular tissues, and its expression levels in nodes are significantly higher than that in internodes at 12-leaf stage.
   - Preferential expression of the VP8 gene in the shoots is correlated with shortened internodes and short, narrowed leaves in the d2003 mutant plants.
   - VP8 is located in ER and the N terminus plays an important role in its localization and function.
