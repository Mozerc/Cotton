## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb019890](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb019890)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmG6PDH4;G6PD2;gpdh4
- **Gene Name:** glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase4
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The drought response-related MBS element was present in the **ZmG6PDH4** and ZmG6PDH5 promoter regions.
   - the stress and defense response-related TC-rich repeat element was observed in the ZmG6PDH1, ZmG6PDH2, and **ZmG6PDH4** promoters, and the cold-responsive LTR element was observed in the ZmG6PDH1, ZmG6PDH2, **ZmG6PDH4**, and ZmG6PDH5 promoters.
   - All these ZmG6PDH promoters contained at least one hormone-responsive cis-acting element, such as the ABA-responsive element (ABRE) and gibberellin-responsive element (GARE).
