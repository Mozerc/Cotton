## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/)
- **Gene Symbol:** SlMPK4
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Solanum lycopersicum
- **NCBI ID:** [ HM367593 ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** []()

## Functions:
   - SlMPK4 is preferentially and highly expressed in tomato stamens and its mRNA levels increase during early flower development, peaking at the mature pollen stage.
   - Suppression of SlMPK4 affects the transcript level of genes related to cell wall formation and modification, cell signal transduction, and metabolic and biosynthetic processes.
   - SlMPK4 plays a critical role in regulating pollen development and fruit development in tomato plants.
