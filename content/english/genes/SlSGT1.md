- **Genome Version:** [tomato genome sequence SL4.0]()

## Functions:
   - Solyc11g010660, a homolog of SGT1 (suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1), was predicted as a target of SlymiR482e-3p and termed as SlSGT1.
   - SlSGT1 was dramatically induced during Fol infection in the susceptible cultivar Moneymaker, meanwhile, the basal level of SlSGT1 was elevated in the SlylmiR482e-3p-KO mutant possibly resulting in the resistance to Fol.
