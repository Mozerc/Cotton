## Functions:
   - Gh_A10G0304, which encodes auxin response factor 3 (GhARF3) and is homologous to AT2G33860 in Arabidopsis.
   - The auxin response factor gene (GhARF3) located in inherited IBD segments from 108Ф and 611Б was highly correlated with fibre quality.
   - GhARF3 was pedigree-selected from the former Soviet Union foundation parents.
