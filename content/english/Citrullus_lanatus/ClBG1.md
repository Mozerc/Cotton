- **Gene Symbol:** ClBG1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Citrullus lanatus

- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Citrullus lanatus (Watermelon (97103) v2)]()

## Functions:
   - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of ClBG1 decreased seed size and promoted seed germination in watermelon.
   - ClBG1, in watermelon was selected for targeted mutagenesis via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Seed size and weight were significantly reduced in the Clbg1-mutant watermelon lines, which was mainly attributed to decreased cell number resulting from decreased ABA levels.
   - ClBG1 may be critical for watermelon seed size regulation and germination mainly through the modulation of ABA content and thereby the transcriptional regulation of cytoskeleton-, cell cycle- and signaling-related genes.
