## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1A02G010500](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/TraesCS1A02G010500)
- **Gene Symbol:** Csl-1A
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome Version:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Chinese_Spring1.0)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - Dinucleotide repeat-length polymorphism in the 5â€²UTR region of the Csl gene was associated with tiller number in diverse wheat germplasm and linked to expression differences of Csl transcripts between NILs.
   - We propose that regulation of Csl transcript and/or protein levels affects carbon partitioning throughout the plant, which plays a key role in the tin phenotype.
   - Csl transcript and/or protein levels alters carbon partitioning throughout the plant, preventing tiller-bud outgrowth and resulting in increased lignification and strength of stems in tin plants.
