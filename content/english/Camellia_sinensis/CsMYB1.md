- **Gene ID:**	[](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/)
- **Gene Symbol:** CsMYB1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Camellia sinensis
- **NCBI ID:** [ MN604029 ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** []()

## Functions:
   - CsMYB1 integrates the regulation of trichome development and catechins biosynthesis in tea plant domestication.
   - CsMYB1 is involved in the regulation of trichome formation and galloylated cis-catechins biosynthesis in tea plants.
   - CsMYB1, trichome and galloylated cis-catechins are coincidently selected during tea domestication by harsh environments for improved adaption and by breeders for better tea flavours.
