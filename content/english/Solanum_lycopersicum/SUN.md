## Functions:
   - Regulation of tomato fruit elongation by transcription factor BZR1.7 through promotion of SUN gene expression.
   - These findings offer new insights into the regulatory mechanism by which BZR1.7 promotes SUN gene expression and regulates fruit elongation in tomato.
   - UN is considered to exert the greatest effect on the elongation of tomato fruit. It encodes a calmodulin binding protein that changes plant hormone abundance and secondary metabolism level, promotes longitudinal division, and inhibits transverse division of the fruit cells.
