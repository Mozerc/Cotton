## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/)
- **Gene Symbol:** PpMAPKK5
- **Gene Name:** P. persica mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5
- **NCBI ID:** [LOC18781583](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=LOC18781583)
- **Genome Version:** [peach reference genome v2.0.a1]()
- **Species:** *Prunus persica*

## Functions:
   - In the MAPK cascade,**PpMAPKK5** was identified as a shortcut interacting protein of PpTGA1 and increased the DNA binding activity of PpTGA1 for the activation of salicylic acid (SA)-responsive PR genes. The overexpression of **PpMAPKK5** in Arabidopsis caused the constitutive transcription of SA-dependent PR genes and as a result conferred resistance against the fungus Rhizopus stolonifer.
   - when the PpPR1, PpPR2, or PpPR5 Pro-LUC reporter construct was coinfiltrated with **PpMAPKK5** and PpTGA1, the LUC/REN ratios were intensely induced and were much higher than those observed with PpTGA1 alone. These results indicate that **PpMAPKK5** could apparently enhance the transactivation of PpTGA1 to the target PR genes.
   - Heterologous expression of **PpMAPKK5** elevates the resistance level to R. stolonifer and relieves cell death in Arabidopsis.These results confirm that the overexpression of **PpMAPKK5** could contribute to the alleviation of cell damage and disease development.
