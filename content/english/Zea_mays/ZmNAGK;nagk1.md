## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb074610](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb074610)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmNAGK;nagk1
- **Gene Name:** N-acetylglutamate kinase1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Over-Expression of a Maize N-Acetylglutamate Kinase Gene (**ZmNAGK**) Improves Drought Tolerance in Tobacco.
   - **ZmNAGK** was expressed at high levels in maize leaves and at lower levels in root, stem, female flower and male flower. The expression of **ZmNAGK** was significantly induced by PEG, NaCl, ABA, brassinosteroid and H2O2.
   - The **ZmNAGK** transgenic tobaccos activated drought responses faster than vector-transformed plants. These results indicate that **ZmNAGK** can play a vital role in enhancing drought tolerance by likely affecting the arginine and NO accumulation, and **ZmNAGK** could be involved in different strategies in response to drought stress.
