## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb256270](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb256270)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCOP1;ZmCOP1a;upl13
- **Gene Name:** ubiquitin-protein ligase13
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - We found that the mesocotyl lengths of zmcop1 loss-of-function mutants were shorter than those of wild-type B73 in darkness, while the mesocotyl lengths of lines with ZmCOP1 overexpression were longer than those of wild-type B104.
   - ZmCOP1 functions in the elongation of etiolated seedlings in darkness and affects plant height in light. Our data can be applied in the improvement of maize plant architecture.
   - ZmCOP1 regulates a wide range of KEGG pathways, such as those for MAPK hormone signal transduction, ribosome formation, RNA transport, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.
