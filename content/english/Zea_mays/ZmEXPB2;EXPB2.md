- **Gene Symbol:** ZmEXPB2;EXPB2;expb4
- **Gene Name:** beta expansin4
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functions:
   - ChIP experiment showed that the up-regulation of the ZmEXPB2 and ZmXET1 genes was associated with the elevated H3K9 acetylation levels on the promoter regions and coding regions of these two genes.
   - ChIP results displayed that up-regulation of the ZmEXPB2 and ZmXET1 genes was associated with an increase in histone H3K9 acetylation levels on the promoter regions and coding regions of these two genes in response to salt stress. Our data indicated that salt stress-induced elevation of H3K9Ac was accompanied by the change of cell well related gene expression, resulting in an adaptive cellular and growth response.
   - ExpB2 plays a role in the elongation of maize roots, and may be also involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli.
