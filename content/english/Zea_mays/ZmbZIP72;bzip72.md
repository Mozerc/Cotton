## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb332590](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb332590)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmbZIP72;bzip72
- **Gene Name:** bZIP-transcription factor 72
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - we cloned **ZmbZIP72**, a bZIP transcription factor gene from maize, which had only one copy in the maize genome and harbored three introns. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of **ZmbZIP72** revealed a highly conserved bZIP DNA-binding domain in its C-terminal region, and four conserved sequences distributed in N- or C-terminal region.
   - Subcellular localization analysis in onion epidermal cells indicated that **ZmbZIP72** was a nuclear protein. Transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that **ZmbZIP72** functioned as a transcriptional activator and its N terminus (amino acids 23â€“63) was necessary for the transactivation activity.
   - Heterologous overexpression of **ZmbZIP72** improved drought and partial salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants, as determined by physiological analyses of leaf water loss, electrolyte leakage, proline content, and survival rate under stress.
