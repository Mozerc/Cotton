- **Gene Symbol:** ZmAPRG;arpg1
- **Gene Name:** acid phosphatase-regulating gene1
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()

## Functions:
   - ZmAPRG, an uncharacterized gene, enhances acid phosphatase activity and Pi concentration in maize leaf during phosphate starvation.
   - An uncharacterized gene, ZmAPRG, isolated by map-based cloning, enhances acid phosphatase activity and phosphate concentration in maize leaf during phosphate starvation.
   - ZmAPRG functions as an upstream regulation node, directly or indirectly regulating APases, protein phosphatases, and phosphate transporter genes involved in Pi metabolism and utilization in maize. These findings will pave the way for elucidating the mechanism of APase regulation, absorption and utilization of Pi, and would facilitate maize breeding for efficient use of fertilizers.
