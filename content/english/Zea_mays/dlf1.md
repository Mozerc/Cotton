## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb331880](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb331880)
- **Gene Symbol:** dlf1
- **Gene Name:** delayed flowering1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **dlf1** (delayed flowering1) encodes a basic leucine zipper protein that interacts with the florigen ZCN8 to mediate floral induction in the shoot apex.
   - We show that **dlf1** promotes maize floral transition by directly activating ZmMADS4 and ZmMADS67 in the shoot apex, providing novel insights into the mechanism of maize floral transition.
   - Nucleotide diversity analysis revealed that **dlf1** and ZmMADS67 were targeted by selection, suggesting that they may have played important roles in maize flowering time adaptation.
   - We demonstrate that **dlf1** underlies qLB7-1, a quantitative trait locus controlling leaf number and flowering time that was identified in a BC2S3 population derived from a cross between maize and its wild ancestor, teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis).
   - The mechanism of how **dlf1** promotes floral transition remains largely unknown.
