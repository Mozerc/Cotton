## Functions:
   - ZmGSK2 was highly and ubiquitously expressed in maize tissues. Heterologous expression of ZmGSK2 carrying a point mutation in Arabidopsis resulted in a stunted growth phenotype, which could be partially rescued by bikinin, a strong activator of BR signaling. Growth responses of maize roots and aerial parts were affected when seedling roots were treated with epibrassinolide or bikinin.
   - Our results suggest that ZmGSK2 is the ortholog of BIN2 and plays a critical role in mediating BR signaling. This study highlights the function of BR pathway key member in maize development and site-directed mutation of ZmGSK2 TREE domain, which extends a strategy to manipulate BR signaling in maize.
   - In this study, we identified ZmGSK2 as the maize ortholog of BIN2 and point mutation of ZmGSK2 showed a bri1-like phenotype similar with other BR signaling mutants.
