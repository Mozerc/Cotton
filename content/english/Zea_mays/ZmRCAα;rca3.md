- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb164380](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb164380)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmRCAα;rca3
- **Gene Name:** RUBISCO activase3
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()

## Functions:
   - Analyses by electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed that ZmRCAα and ZmRCAβ encode larger and smaller polypeptides of approximately 46 and 43 kD, respectively.
   - Transcriptional analyses demonstrated that the expression levels of both ZmRCAα and ZmRCAβ were higher in leaves and during grain filling and that expression followed a specific cyclic day/night pattern. In 123 maize inbred lines with extensive genetic diversity, the transcript abundance and protein expression levels of these two RCA genes were positively correlated with grain yield.
   - The ZmRCAα and ZmRCAβ transcripts accumulated primarily in the leaves and, to a lesser extent, in the stems, tassel spikelets, and immature ears of the plants, whereas no or very low signal was detected in the roots. We also examined the protein expression levels of ZmRCAα and ZmRCAβ and obtained a similar result.
