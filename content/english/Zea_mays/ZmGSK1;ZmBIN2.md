- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb120370](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb120370)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGSK1;ZmBIN2;ZmSK2;gsk1
- **Gene Name:** glycogen synthase kinase1
- **Species:** Zea mays
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*

## Functions:
   - ZmGSK1 and ZmGSK2 contained conserved catalytic domains representing a Serine/Threonine protein kinase; however, ZmGSK2 (identity: 81.39%) shared more similarity than ZmGSK1 (81.08%) with BIN2 and OsGSK2.
   - The relative expression level of ZmGSK1 was higher in roots and endosperm as compared with the ZmGSK2 gene. And in contrast, lower expression levels were observed in shoots, leaf, anthers, and nucellus as compared to the ZmGSK2 that showed relatively higher expression respectively.
   - The two ZmGSKs were ubiquitously expressed in maize tissues. This result suggests that ZmGSK2 functions more strongly than ZmGSK1 in maize tissue development.
