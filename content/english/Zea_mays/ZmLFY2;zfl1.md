## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb430240](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb430240)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmLFY2;zfl1
- **Gene Name:** zea floricaula/leafy1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **zfl1** and zfl2 double mutants exhibit a disruption of floral organ identity and patterning, as well as defects in inflorescence architecture and in the vegetative to reproductive phase transition.
   - Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the trends associated with **zfl1** genotype in the segregating populations require **zfl1** activity rather than being caused by segregation of a linked gene or genes.
   - Despite overlap in traits associated with these duplicate genes, **zfl1** showed stronger associations with flowering time, while zfl2 associated more strongly with branching and inflorescence structure traits, suggesting some divergence of function.
