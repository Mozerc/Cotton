## Functions:
   - Global maize cultivation is often adversely affected by drought stress. The CC-type glutaredoxin (GRX) genes form a plant-specific subfamily that regulate plant growth and respond to environmental stresses. However, how maize CC-type GRX (ZmGRXCC) genes respond to drought stress remains unclear.
   - ZmGRXCC5, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18 were up-regulated above two-fold under drought, salinity, cold and heat, while others were down-regulated or undetected, indicated functional divergence of ZmGRXCCs in maize.
   - These results will help to advance the study of the function of ZmGRXCCs genes under drought stress and understand the mechanism of drought resistance in maize.
