## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb362820](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb362820)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmRR4;gpm84;crr4
- **Gene Name:** cytokinin response regulator4
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Genes for histidyl-aspartyl (His-Asp) phosphorelay components (His-containing phosphotransfer proteins, HP, and response regulators, RR) were isolated from Zea mays L. to characterize their function in cytokinin signaling. Six type-A RRs (ZmRR1, ZmRR2, ZmRR4–ZmRR7), 3 type-B RRs (ZmRR8–ZmRR10), and 3 HPs (ZmHP1–ZmHP3) were found in leaves.
   - Type-A RRs were localized partly to the cytosol (ZmRR1, ZmRR2, and ZmRR3) and partly to the nucleus (**ZmRR4**, ZmRR5, and ZmRR6). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, ZmHP1 and ZmHP3 interacted with both cytosolic ZmRR1 and nuclear type-B ZmRRs.
   - In vitro experiments demonstrated that ZmHPs function as a phospho-donor for ZmRRs; turnover rates of the phosphorylated state were tenfold lower in ZmRR8 and ZmRR9 than in ZmRR1 and **ZmRR4**.
