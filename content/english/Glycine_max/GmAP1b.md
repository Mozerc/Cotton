## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.08G269800](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Glyma.08G269800)
- **Gene Symbol:** GmAP1b
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Glycine max
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** []()

## Functions:
   - Loss of function of all four AP1 homologs resulted in delayed flowering and modified floral morphology. Interestingly, stem node number and plant height were greater in the AP1 quadruple mutants. Further analysis suggested that GmAP1 regulates the expression of several flowering-related and GA metabolic pathway-related genes, thereby uncovering important interactions between the flowering time and plant height regulatory networks mediated by AP1 in soybean.
