## Functions:
   - Overexpressing MdWRKY53 enhanced KCl tolerance in transgenic apple plants by increasing K+ efflux and K+ compartmentalization. Subsequently, we characterized the transporter genes MdGORK1 and MdNHX2 as downstream targets of MdWRKY53 by ChIP-seq. MdGORK1 localized to the plasma membrane and enhanced K+ efflux to increase KCl tolerance in transgenic apple plants. Moreover, overexpressing MdNHX2 enhanced the KCl tolerance of transgenic apple plants/callus by compartmentalizing K+ into the vacuole. RT–qPCR and LUC activity analyses indicated that MdWRKY53 binds to the promoters of MdGORK1 and MdNHX2 and induces their transcription.
