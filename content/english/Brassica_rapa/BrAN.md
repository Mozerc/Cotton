## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[BraA10g000480.3C](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/BraA10g000480.3C)
- **Gene Symbol:** BrAN
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Brassica rapa
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [V3.0 reference genome]()

## Functions:
   - As BraA10g000480.3C was the ortholog of ANGUSTIFOLIA in Arabidopsis, which has been found to regulate leaf width by controlling cortical microtubule arrangement and pavement cell shape, we named it BrAN.
   - BrAN in mutant lhd1 carried an SNP (G to A) on intron 2 that co-segregated with the mutant phenotype, and disrupted the exon-intron splice junction generating intron retention and a putative truncated protein.
   - BrAN contributes to leafy head formation of Chinese cabbage.
