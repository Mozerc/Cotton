## Gene Details
- **Gene ID:**	[BnaA03g40190D](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/BnaA03g40190D)
- **Gene Symbol:** BnaA3.MYB28
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Species:** Brassica napus
- **NCBI ID:** [  ]()
- **Protein Sequence:** *Not Available*
- **Genome Version:** [B. napus reference genome Darmor v4.1]()

## Functions:
   - BnaA3.MYB28 was responsible for high leaf/low seed GSL content and could explain 30.62% of the total leaf GSL variation in the low seed GSL panel and was not fixed during double-low rapeseed breeding.
   - A 1356-bp insertion in BnaA3.MYB28 resulted in lower GSL content in leaves.
   - BnaA03g40190D (BnaA3.MYB28) gene was not fixed and was responsible for high leaf/low seed GSL content.
