## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS3A03G0950800](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS3A03G0950800)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaSD1-3A
- **Gene Name:** GA 20-oxidase 2
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaSD1-3A** was located in QRC-3A-IV, and there were only two haplotypes in 677 bread wheat resequencing data, which were related to gibber metabolism.
   - Release the potential for reducing plant height of TaSD1 in wheat.
   - **TaSD1** had not been widely utilized in wheat due to lack of alleles.
   - **TaSD1** was regulated by DELLA in wheat.
   - Three homeologues of **TaSD1** have no differences in the stem among TNL, Rht-B1b-OE and Rht-B1b-KO lines, which allow breeders breeding semi-dwarf wheat combined **TaSD1** with Rht-B1b.
