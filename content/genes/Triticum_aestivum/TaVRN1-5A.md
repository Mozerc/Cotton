## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS5A02G391700](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS5A02G391700)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaVRN1-5A
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Positional cloning of the wheat vernalization gene VRN1.
   - VRN1 and VRN2 (unrelated to the genes with similar names in Arabidopsis) are the main genes involved in the vernalization response in diploid wheat Triticum monococcum.
   - Winter wheats require several weeks at low temperature to flower. This process, vernalization, is controlled mainly by the VRN1 gene.
   - The epistatic interactions between vernalization genes VRN1 and VRN2 suggested a model in which VRN2 would repress directly or indirectly the expression of AP1. A mutation in the promoter region of AP1 would result in the lack of recognition of the repressor and in a dominant spring growth habit.
   - We also present the expression patterns of two MADS-box genes completely linked to VRN1 and discuss the evidence supporting one of these genes as a strong candidate gene for VRN1.
