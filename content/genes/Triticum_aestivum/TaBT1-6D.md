## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS6D02G168200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** TaBT1-6D
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - TaBT1, affecting starch synthesis and thousand kernel weight, underwent strong selection during wheat improvement
   - TaBT1 was mainly expressed in developing grains, and knockdown of TaBT1 in common wheat produced a decrease in grain size, thousand kernel weight.
   - Our findings suggest that TaBT1 has an important effect on starch synthesis and TKW, and provide two valuable molecular markers for marker assisted selection (MAS) in wheat high-yield breeding.
   - Our results demonstrate the essential role of BT1 in wheat starch synthesis and TKW, and its potential for wheat molecular breeding.
