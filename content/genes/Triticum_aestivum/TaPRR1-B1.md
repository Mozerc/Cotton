## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS6B02G253900](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS6B02G253900)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaPRR1-B1

- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we identified polymorphisms and haplotypes of TaPRR1, demonstrating that natural variations in TaPRR1 are associated with significant differences in yield-related traits including heading date, plant height and thousand grain weight.
   - TaPRR1-6A-Hapla showed an earlier heading date, advanced by 0.9 to 1.7%. TaPRR1-6B-Hapla and TaPRR1-6D-Hapla displayed reduced plant height and increased thousand grain weight of up to 13.3 to 26.4% and 6.3 to 17.3%, respectively.
   - Subcellular localization and transcriptional activity analysis showed that TaPRR1 is a nuclear localization protein with transcriptional activity controlled by an IR domain.
   - The expression profiles of TaPRR1 genes over a 48-h period were characterized by circadian rhythms, which had two peaks under both short- and long- day conditions.
   - In addition, geographical distribution analysis indicated higher distribution frequencies of TaPRR1-6A-Hapla, TaPRR1-6B-Haplb, and TaPRR1-6D-Haplb in different agro-ecological production zones.
