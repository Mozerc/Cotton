## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS3A02G155200](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS3A02G155200)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaIAA17-3A
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - TaHST1L strongly interacted with TaIAA17 and inhibited its expression at the protein level, and thus possibly improved the content of endogenous auxin in the basal tissue of tillers.
   - Inhibition of TaHST1L to TaIAA17 at the protein level through interaction possibly caused accumulation of endogenous auxin in the basal tissue of tillers.
   - TaHST1L affected endogenous auxin level by interacting with TaIAA17.
   - Since TaHST1L was possibly involved in auxin signal transduction through interacting with TaIAA17, the leaf sheath pulvinus of TaHST1L-OE and WT LX987 plants was used to perform transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis.
