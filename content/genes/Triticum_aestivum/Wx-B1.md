## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS4A02G418200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** Wx-B1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - Deficiency of the wheat waxy (Wx) proteins (Wx-A1, **Wx-B1** and Wx-D1) was studied in 1,960 cultivars derived from several countries.
   - While 9 Japanese cultivars were deficient in both the Wx-A1 and **Wx-B1** proteins, no cultivars lacked both the Wx-A1 and Wx-D1 proteins, both the **Wx-B1** and Wx-D1 proteins or all three Wx proteins.
   - The Wx-A1 gene coding the Wx-A1 protein and the **Wx-B1** gene coding the **Wx-B1** protein were localized in the distal regions of chromosome arms 7AS and 4AL, respectively, by deletion mapping using the deletion lines developed in the common wheat cultivar ‘Chinese Spring’.
