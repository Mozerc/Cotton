## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS4B02G234100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** TaDWF4-4B
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - Over-expression of TaDWF4 increases wheat productivity under low and sufficient nitrogen through enhanced carbon assimilation.
   - The increased biomass production and yield per plant in TaDWF4 OE lines could be linked to modified carbon partitioning and changes in expression pattern of the growth regulator Target Of Rapamycin.
   - Overexpression of **TaDWF4-4B** in wheat leads to the upregulation of BR responsive genes.
   - Overexpression of **TaDWF4-4B** increases productivity under low to high N levels.
   - OTaDWF4-B overexpression maintains photosynthesis under N limitation.
