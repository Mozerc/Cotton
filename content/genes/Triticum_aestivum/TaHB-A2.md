## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1A02G157500](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS1A02G157500)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaHB-A2
- **Gene Name:** HOMEOBOX DOMAIN-D2
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - MicroRNA-resistant alleles of HOMEOBOX DOMAIN-2 modify inflorescence branching and increase grain protein content of wheat.
   - Higher HB-2 expression is associated with modified leaf and vascular development and increased amino acid supply to the inflorescence during grain development.
   - The spatiotemporal expression pattern is consistent with HB-2 performing a role during spikelet formation, including stages of inflorescence development critical for paired spikelet production.
   - These results show that paired spikelet formation is promoted by increased expression of HB-2 homeologs on the A and D subgenomes, which can be facilitated by modifying bases in the miR165/166 complementary site.
   - Increased HB-2 expression facilitates higher grain protein content.
   - Together, these results suggest that increased expression of HB-2 facilitates the production of grain with more protein by modifying vascular development, which increases the supply of assimilates to the inflorescence and developing grain.
