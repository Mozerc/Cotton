## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS3B02G357500](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS3B02G357500)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaERF3-3B
- **Gene Name:** Ethylene-responsive factor-like transcription factor 3
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Genetic evidence and expression analysis indicate that TaIAA21, TaARF25, and TaERF3 may work in the same pathway during grain development. 
   - Screening of auxin response factor genes highly expressed in early developing grains identified TaARF25 that interacted with TaIAA21.
   - In contrast,mutation of the tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum) ARF25 gene significantly reduced grain size and weight.
   - ERF3 was up-regulated in the taiaa21 mutant and down-regulated in ttarf25 mutant. Transactivation assays showed that ARF25 promoted ERF3 transcription, while mutation of TtERF3 resulted in reduced grain size and weight.
