- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In the case of TaDEP1, the aabbdd mutant plants with frameshift mutations in all six alleles exhibited an extremely dwarf phenotype (with a mean plant height of 36.7cm) compared with their WT counterparts.
   - These results demonstrate for the first time that TaDEP1 is an important regulator of wheat growth and development.
