## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1A02G255100](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS1A02G255100)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaGID1-1A
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We also show that overexpression of TaCRY1a reduces plant height and coleoptile growth in wheat and that TaCRY1a interacts with both TaGID1 and Rht1 to competitively attenuate the TaGID1-Rht1 interaction.
   - The blue light receptor CRY1 interacts with GID1 and DELLA proteins to repress gibberellin signaling and plant growth.
   - We find that CRY1 also directly interacts with the GA receptor GID1 to competitively inhibit the GID1-GAI interaction.
   - Overexpression of TaCRY1a reduces plant height and coleoptile growth in wheat and that TaCRY1a interacts with both TaGID1 and Rht1 to competitively attenuate the TaGID1-Rht1 interaction.
   - The photoreceptor CRY1 competitively inhibits the GID1-DELLA interaction, thereby stabilizing DELLA proteins and enhancing their repression of plant growth.
