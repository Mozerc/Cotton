## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS2A02G293400](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS2A02G293400)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaSBEIIa-A
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The generation of high-amylose wheat through targeted mutagenesis of TaSBEIIa in a modern winter wheat cv Zhengmai 7698 (ZM) and a spring wheat cv Bobwhite by CRISPR/Cas9, respectively.
   - Modification of starch composition, structure and properties through editing of TaSBEIIa in both winter and spring wheat varieties by CRISPR/Cas9.
   - Inheritance and stability of the mutations and generation of transgene-free wheat TasbeIIa mutant lines.
   - Modification of the starch composition, structure and properties through gene editing of TaSBEIIa in both winter and spring wheat varieties.
   - Our finding provides deep insights on the role of TaSBEIIa in determining starch composition, structure, properties and end-use quality in different genetic backgrounds and improving RS content with multiple breeding and end-use applications in cereal crop species through genome editing for health benefits.
