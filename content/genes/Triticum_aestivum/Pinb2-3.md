## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS7A02G514505](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS7A02G514505)
- **Gene Symbol:** Pinb2-3
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We developed new Pinb2 allele specific markers and demonstrated their usefulness by identifying new Pinb2 alleles in Triticeae species performing an association analysis of Pinb2 with kernel hardness.
   - Pinb and Pinb2 loci with kernel hardness phenotypes was determined by a Chi-square test of independence.
   - Using the high-quality bread wheat reference genome, we show that PINB2 are encoded by three homoeologous loci Pinb2 not syntenic to the Hardness locus, with Pinb2-7A locus containing three tandem copies.
   - PINB2 proteins have several features conserved for the Pin/Pinb2 phylogenetic cluster but lack a structural basis of significant impact on kernel hardness. Pinb2 are seed-specifically expressed with varied expression levels between the homoeologous copies and among wheat varieties.
