- **Gene Symbol:** TaGW7-B1

- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Effects of the TaGW7 gene editing on grain size and weight.
   - With the increase in the functional TaGW7 copy number, the grain width and TGW decreased and grain length increased (Figure 3), but change in grain area was not obvious.
   - By editing the TaGW7 homoeologs in the B and D genomes, we showed that mutations in either of the two or both genomes increased the grain width and weight but reduced the grain length.
   - The effect sizes of mutations in the TaGW7 gene homoeologs coincided with the relative levels of their expression in the B and D genomes.
   - The effects of gene editing on grain morphology and weight traits were dosage dependent with the double-copy mutant showing larger effect than the respective single copy mutants.
