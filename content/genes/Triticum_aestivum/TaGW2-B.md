## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS6B02G215300](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS6B02G215300)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaGW2-B</u>
- **Gene Name:** Grain Width 2
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - TaDA1, a conserved negative regulator of kernel size, has an additive effect with **TaGW2** in common wheat.
   - The simultaneous silencing of TaDA1 and **TaGW2** has an additive effect on kernel size and weight.
   - TaDA1 and **TaGW2** function in partially overlapping but relatively independent protein networks.
   - A comparative proteome analysis of developing transgenic and wild-type grains indicated that TaDA1 and **TaGW2** are involved in partially overlapping but relatively independent protein regulatory networks.
   - TaDA1 and **TaGW2** act relatively independently of each other; for example, several proteins related to cell proliferation and cell expansion were significantly up-regulated in GW2-Ri-3.
   - The E3 ligase **TaGW2** regulates drought resistance in wheat.
   - **TaGW2** homoeologs also affect grain protein content as this parameter was generally increased in the mutants, especially in the lines lacking two or three homoeologs.
   - **TaGW2** homoeologs also affect grain protein content as this parameter was generally increased in the mutants, especially in the lines lacking two or three homoeologs.
   - Down-regulation of the **TaGW2** gene by RNA interference results in decreased grain size and weight in wheat.
