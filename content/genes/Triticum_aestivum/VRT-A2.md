- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VRT-A2</u>
- **Gene Name:** VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE TRANSITION 2

- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ectopic expression of Triticum polonicum **VRT-A2** underlies elongated glumes and grains in hexaploid wheat in a dosage-dependent manner.
   - Expression levels of **VRT-A2** affect spike, glume, grain, and floral organ length in a dosage-dependent manner.
   - Ectopic expression of **VRT-A2** leads to phenotypic effects in a dosage-dependent manner.
   - Transgenic lines of hexaploid wheat carrying the T. polonicum **VRT-A2** allele show that expression levels of **VRT-A2** are highly correlated with spike, glume, grain, and floral organ length.
   - Based on multi-year field trials and transgenic lines, we show that higher expression of **VRT-A2** in the basal sections of the spike is associated with increased numbers of rudimentary basal spikelets.
   - The increased number of rudimentary basal spikelets (RBSs) due to **VRT-A2** misexpression supports the hypothesis that high expression levels of SVPs in the basal section delays spikelet establishment, leading to their rudimentary shape in the mature spike.
