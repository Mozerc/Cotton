## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=)
- **Gene Symbol:** VRN-D4
- **Gene Name:** VERNALIZATION 4
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A fourth vernalization locus, **VRN-D4**, has been mapped on the proximal region of the short arm of chromosome 5D.
   - Characterization of the **VRN-D4** Allele for Spring Growth Habit.
   - Identified VERNALIZATION 4 (**VRN-D4**), a vernalization gene that was critical for the development of spring growth habit in the ancient wheats from South Asia.
   - Suggesting that **VRN-D4** likely contributed to local adaptation and was favored by positive selection.
   - Segregating populations generated from these isogenic lines revealed that **VRN-D4** has strong epistatic interactions with the other vernalization genes and is part of the same vernalization pathway.
