## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS2A02G081900](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS2A02G081900)
- **Gene Symbol:** PPD-A1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - No candidate mutation was found in the 2B PRR gene but polymorphism within the 2B PRR gene cosegregated with the Ppd-B1 locus in a doubled haploid population, suggesting that insensitivity on 2B is due to a mutation outside the sequenced region or to a closely linked gene.
   - Photoperiod insensitivity can also be conferred by mutation at a homoeologous locus on chromosome 2B (Ppd-B1). 
   - Varieties with the photoperiod insensitive Ppd-D1a allele which causes early flowering in short (SD) or LDs had a 2 kb deletion upstream of the coding region.
   - Five Ppd-D1 alleles were found but only the 2 kb deletion was associated with photoperiod insensitivity.
