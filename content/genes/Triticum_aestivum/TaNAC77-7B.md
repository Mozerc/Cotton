## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS7B02G056300](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS7B02G056300)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaNAC77-7B
- **Gene Name:** NAC domain protein 77
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The homolog of TuNAC77 in common wheat, TaNAC77, shared an identical function, and the total SSPs were reduced by about 24% in common wheat when TaNAC77 was knocked down.
   - TaNAC77 elevated both the promoter activities and the transcription of SSP genes in vivo.
   - TaNAC77 was suppressed in common wheat, the total SSPs, including glutenins and gliadins, were reduced.
   - In the dual-luciferase reporter assay, TaNAC77 enhanced the promoter activities of all the measured SSP genes (Glu-1Bx7, Glu-1By8, Glu-1Dx2, Glu-1Dy12, A3-620, D3-578, TaGli-α-1 and TaGli-ω-10) from Chinese Spring by 1–27-fold.
   - Both the transcription of SSP genes and the accumulation of SSPs were inhibited in TaNAC77 RNAi wheat.
