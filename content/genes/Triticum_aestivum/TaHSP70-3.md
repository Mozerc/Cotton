- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS4D02G207500](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS4D02G207500)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaHSP70-3</u>
- **Gene Name:** Heat Shock Protein 70
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The TaHSFA6e-TaHSP70s pathway contributes to thermotolerance in wheat.
   - TaHSP70s promote thermotolerance by influencing translation re-initiation in wheat.
   - TaHSP70s are involved in regulating stress granule dissolution and translation re-initiation after recovery from heat stress in wheat.
   - TaHSP70s are localized in stress granule following exposure to heat stress and are involved in regulating stress granule disassembly and translation re-initiation upon stress relief. Polysome profiling analysis confirms that the translational efficiency of stress granule stored mRNAs is lower at the recovery stage in Tahsp70s mutants than in the wild types.
