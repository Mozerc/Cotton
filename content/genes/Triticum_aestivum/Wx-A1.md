- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Wx-A1</u>

- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Deficiency of the wheat waxy (Wx) proteins (**Wx-A1**, Wx-B1 and Wx-D1) was studied in 1,960 cultivars derived from several countries.
   - While 9 Japanese cultivars were deficient in both the **Wx-A1** and Wx-B1 proteins, no cultivars lacked both the **Wx-A1** and Wx-D1 proteins, both the Wx-B1 and Wx-D1 proteins or all three Wx proteins.
   - The **Wx-A1** gene coding the **Wx-A1** protein and the Wx-B1 gene coding the Wx-B1 protein were localized in the distal regions of chromosome arms 7AS and 4AL, respectively, by deletion mapping using the deletion lines developed in the common wheat cultivar ‘Chinese Spring’.
   - Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed polymorphisms of the three Wx proteins that varied according to isoelectric points or molecular weight.
