## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS5D02G004000](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS5D02G004000)
- **Gene Symbol:** Gsp-1
- **Gene Name:** Softness Protein-1
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In hexaploid wheat, the tight linkage among these three genes has not been broken, such that the Ha locus haplotype (Pina-D1, Pinb-D1 and Gsp-D1) is associated with kernel texture phenotype.
   - Both Pin genes have been deleted from chromosomes 5A and 5B during the evolution of durum wheat (the contributor of A and B genomes of common wheat). In contrast, all three **Gsp-1** genes (from the A, B and D genomes) are conserved in common wheat.
   - Among members of the Triticeae, most notably wheat, much of the variation in texture is controlled by a single locus comprised of the Puroindoline a, Puroindoline b and Grain Softness Protein-1 (**Gsp-1**) genes.
