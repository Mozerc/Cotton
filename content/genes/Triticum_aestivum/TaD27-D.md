## Functional Descriptions:
   - We characterized the biological roles of the TaD27 genes in the regulation of wheat plant architecture in detail.
   - TaD27 genes in wheat, orthologs of rice D27 encoding an enzyme involved in SLs biosynthesis, were identified.
   - TaD27-RNAi axillary bud primordia, many genes involved in the SLs signalling pathway and axillary bud development were identified in wheat, confirming the SLs signalling pathway mediates axillary bud development. 
   - The TaD27 proteins were highly conserved with D27 proteins in Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting that they were orthologs of D27 proteins.
   - Characterized the biological roles of the TaD27 genes in the regulation of wheat plant architecture in detail.
