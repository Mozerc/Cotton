## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS6B02G210000](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS6B02G210000)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaBT1-6B
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - BRITTLE1 (BT1), responsible for unidirectional transmembrane transport of ADP-glucose, plays a pivotal role in starch synthesis of cereal grain. In this study, we isolated three TaBT1 homoeologous genes located on chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D in common wheat.
   - TaBT1, affecting starch synthesis and thousand kernel weight, underwent strong selection during wheat improvement.
   - TaBT1 was mainly expressed in developing grains, and knockdown of TaBT1 in common wheat produced a decrease in grain size, thousand kernel weight.
   - Our findings suggest that TaBT1 has an important effect on starch synthesis and TKW, and provide two valuable molecular markers for marker assisted selection (MAS) in wheat high-yield breeding.
   - Our results demonstrate the essential role of BT1 in wheat starch synthesis and TKW, and its potential for wheat molecular breeding.
   - High diversity was detected at the **TaBT1-6B** locus, with 24 polymorphic sites forming three haplotypes (Hap1, Hap2, and Hap3). Association analysis revealed that Hap1 and Hap2 were preferred haplotypes in modern breeding, for their significant correlations with higher TKW.
