## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS7B02G158600](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS7B02G158600)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaSEP3-B1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression patterns of the three homoeologs TaSEP3-A1, **TaSEP3-B1**, and TaSEP3-D1 were similar, and higher expression levels weredetected in floral organs and developing kernels.
   - A SEP3-like MADS-box gene TaSEP3-1 was isolated from bread wheat. The expression patterns of the three homoeologs TaSEP3-A1, **TaSEP3-B1**, and TaSEP3-D1 were similar, and higher expression levels were detected in floral organs and developing kernels.
   - Wheat MADS-box gene **TaSEP3-D1** negatively regulates heading date.
   - Transgenic wheat genotypes overexpressing **TaSEP3-D1** exhibited delayed heading and reduced plant height, indicating a role in regulating heading date and plant development.
   - These results shed light on the role of **TaSEP3-D1** in wheat plant development. The favored haplotype of **TaSEP3-D1** can be applied in breeding to improve plant architecture and yield in wheat.
