## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS4D02G147600](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS4D02G147600)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaNHX1-4D
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - To a lesser extent of TaNHX1 were associated with a better genotypic performance in growth, nitrogen, and carbon photosynthetic metabolism under salinity and water stress.
   - The TaNHX1 gene was also cloned and it was reported that salt-stressed wheat plants showed substantial increases in TaNHX1.
   - TaNHX1 expression and ion accumulation.
   - In general terms, higher expression of TaGS1, TaGS2, TaDREB2B, and to a lesser extent of TaNHX1 were associated with a better genotypic performance in growth, nitrogen, and carbon photosynthetic metabolism under salinity and water stress.
