## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS2A02G310300](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS2A02G310300)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaSBEIIb
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The role of **TaSBEIIb** in determining starch composition, structure, properties and end-use quality in different genetic backgrounds and improving RS content with multiple breeding and end-use applications in cereal crop species through genome editing for health benefits.
   - Studies over past decades have established that down-regulation of the two different isoforms of starch-branching enzyme (SBE) II (TaSBEIIa and **TaSBEIIb**) through plant-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) increased wheat amylose content.
   - Suppression of **TaSBEIIb** expression alone had no effect on amylose content; however, suppression of both TaSBEIIa and **TaSBEIIb** expression resulted in starch containing >70% amylose , implying TaSBEIIa plays a more profound role in determining the starch property of wheat.
   - We postulated that this was probably due to the high similarity of TaSBEIIa and **TaSBEIIb**, RNAi construct could suppress both SBEIIa and SBEIIb activity simultaneously.
