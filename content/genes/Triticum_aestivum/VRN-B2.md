## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS4B02G372700](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS4B02G372700)
- **Gene Symbol:** VRN-B2
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The vernalization gene VRN-2 in winter wheat cultivars prevents flowering during the winter season, but repression can be removed by low temperature (vernalization) and winter wheat cultivars thus flower in the following spring.
   - Two duplicated copies of **VRN-B2** were isolated from 2174, but no **VRN-B2** was isolated from Jagger, indicating that Jagger carried a null **VRN-B2** allele.
   - Mapping of the **VRN-B2** gene indicated that both **VRN-B2** copies in 2174 were tightly linked with SNPs on chromosome 4BL, indicating that the duplicated **VRN-B2** genes were arranged in a tandem pattern at the same locus.
