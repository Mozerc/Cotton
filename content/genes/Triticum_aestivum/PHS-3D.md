## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS3D02G468400](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS3D02G468400)
- **Gene Symbol:** PHS-3D
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We demonstrate that **PHS-3D** is Myb10-D and negatively controls germination by activating 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) transcription, which is involved in ABA biosynthesis; deepening grain color and increasing barriers to water uptake in wheat.
   - These results support the assumption that the Myb10-D identified as **PHS-3D** is involved in PHS resistance in wheat.
   - Myb10-D confers **PHS-3D** resistance to pre-harvest sprouting by regulating NCED in ABA biosynthesis pathway of wheat.
   - **PHS-3D** is Myb10-D and negatively controls germination by activating 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) transcription, which is involved in ABA biosynthesis; deepening grain color and increasing barriers to water uptake in wheat.
