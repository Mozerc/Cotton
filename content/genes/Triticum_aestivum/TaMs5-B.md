## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS3B02G392800LC](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS3B02G392800LC)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaMs5-B
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Wheat ms5 male-sterility is induced by recessive homoeologous A and D genome non-specific lipid transfer proteins
   - Allelic forms of **TaMs5-B** in bread and durum wheat are non-functional
   - We identify TaMs5 as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipid transfer protein required for normal pollen exine development, and by transgenic complementation demonstrate that TaMs5-A restores fertility to ms5.
   - We show ms5 locates to a centromere-proximal interval and has a sterility inheritance pattern modulated by TaMs5-D but not **TaMs5-B**.
   - Consistent with reduced functionality, transcript abundance in developing anthers was found to be lower for TaMs5-D than TaMs5-A. At the 3B homoeolocus, we found only non-functional alleles among 178 diverse hexaploid and tetraploid wheats that include landraces and Triticum dicoccoides.
