## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS7D02G176700](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS7D02G176700)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaVRT-2
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results support the hypothesis that **TaVRT-2** is a putative repressor of the floral transition in wheat.
   - **TaVRT-2**, a Member of the StMADS-11 Clade of Flowering Repressors, Is Regulated by Vernalization and Photoperiod in Wheat.
   - Expression profiling of **TaVRT-2** in near-isogenic lines and different genotypes with natural variation in their response to vernalization and photoperiod showed a strong relationship with floral transition.
   - Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that **TaVRT-2** interacts with proteins encoded by two important vernalization genes (TaVRT-1/VRN-1 and VRN-2) in wheat.
   - These results support the hypothesis that **TaVRT-2** is a putative repressor of the floral transition in wheat.
