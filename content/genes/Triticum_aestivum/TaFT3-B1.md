## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1B02G351100](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS1B02G351100)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaFT3-B1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Suggesting that **TaFT3-B1** promotes flowering. Significant association was observed in the GEDIFLUX collection for TaTOE1-B1, a putative flowering repressor.
   - **TaFT3-B1** promotes flowering, these genes present alternative routes for the fine tuning of flowering time control in wheat.
   - The identification of new candidate genes Triticum aestivum FLOWERING LOCUS T3-B1 (**TaFT3-B1**) and TARGET OF EAT1 (TaTOE1-B1) controlling the short-day photoperiod response in bread wheat.
   - Loss of **TaFT3-B1** by deletion was associated with late flowering.
   - Increased **TaFT3-B1** copy number was associated with early flowering, suggesting that **TaFT3-B1** promotes flowering.
   - As TaTOE-B1 represses and **TaFT3-B1** promotes flowering, these genes present alternative routes for the fine tuning of flowering time control in wheat.
   - Significant association was observed in the GEDIFLUX collection for TaTOE1-B1, a putative flowering repressor.
