## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1B02G408200](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS1B02G408200)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaASN2-1B</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Wheat with greatly reduced accumulation of free asparagine in the grain, produced by CRISPR/Cas9 editing of asparagine synthetase gene TaASN2.
   - TaASN2 encodes the glutamine amidotransferase domain of the protein.
   - Free asparagine concentrations in the grain of plants carrying edits in all six TaASN2 alleles were substantially reduced compared with wildtype, with one plant showing a more than 90% reduction in the T2 seeds.
   - TaASN2 gene in wheat cv. Cadenza using CRISPR/Cas9, to reduce asparagine synthetase gene expression in the grain without affecting its expression elsewhere in the plant.
