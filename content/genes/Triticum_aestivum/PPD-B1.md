## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCSU02G196100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** PPD-B1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - A Pseudo-Response Regulator is misexpressed in the photoperiod insensitive Ppd-D1a mutant of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).
   - No candidate mutation was found in the 2B PRR gene but polymorphism within the 2B PRR gene cosegregated with the **PPD-B1** locus in a doubled haploid population, suggesting that insensitivity on 2B is due to a mutation outside the sequenced region or to a closely linked gene.
   - Photoperiod insensitivity can also be conferred by mutation at a homoeologous locus on chromosome 2B (**PPD-B1**).

   - Photoperiod insensitivity can also be conferred by mutation at a homoeologous locus on chromosome 2B (**PPD-B1**). 
   - Varieties with the photoperiod insensitive Ppd-D1a allele which causes early flowering in short (SD) or LDs had a 2 kb deletion upstream of the coding region.
   - Five Ppd-D1 alleles were found but only the 2 kb deletion was associated with photoperiod insensitivity.
