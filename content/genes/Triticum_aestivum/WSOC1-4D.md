## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS4D02G341700](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS4D02G341700)
- **Gene Symbol:** WSOC1-4D
- **Gene Name:** WHEAT SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we isolated a wheat ortholog of SOC1, wheat SOC1 (**WSOC1**), and investigated its relationship to WAP1 in the flowering pathway. **WSOC1** is expressed in young spikes but preferentially expressed in leaves.
   - **WSOC1** is expressed in young spikes but preferentially expressed in leaves.
   - **WSOC1** functions as a flowering activator in Arabidopsis.
   - **WSOC1** expression is affected neither by vernalization nor photoperiod, whereas it is induced by gibberellin at the seedling stage.
   - These findings indicate that **WSOC1** acts in a pathway different from the WAP1-related vernalization and photoperiod pathways.
