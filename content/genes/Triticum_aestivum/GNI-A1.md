## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCSU02G009800](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCSU02G009800)
- **Gene Symbol:** GNI-A1
- **Gene Name:** Grain Number Increase 1
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **GNI1** gene, encoding an HD-Zip I transcription factor, was identified as responsible for increased floret fertility.
   - Genetic analysis has revealed that the reduced-function allele **GNI-A1** contributes to the increased number of fertile florets per spikelet. The RNAi-based knockdown of GNI1 led to an increase in the number of both fertile florets and grains in hexaploid wheat.
   - The locus **Grain Number Increase 1 (GNI1)** is shown here to be an important contributor to floret fertility. **GNI1** evolved in the Triticeae through gene duplication. The gene, which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper class I (HD-Zip I) transcription factor, was expressed most abundantly in the most apical floret primordia and in parts of the rachilla, suggesting that it acts to inhibit rachilla growth and development.
   - The RNAi-based knockdown of **GNI1** led to an increase in the number of both fertile florets and grains in hexaploid wheat.
