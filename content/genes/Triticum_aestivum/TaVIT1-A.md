## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS2A02G336600](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS2A02G336600)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaVIT1-A
- **Gene Name:** VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER 1
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identified and functionally characterized TaVIT1 and TaVIT2, the two VIT paralogs found in the genome of bread wheat.
   - This suggests that TaVIT1 is indeed a functioning iron transporter but that it localizes mainly to a membrane other than the tonoplast.
   - These data indicate that both TaVIT1 and TaVIT2 are able to transport iron but that their localization in the cell may differ.
   - TaVIT1 and TaVIT2 are both expressed in the aleurone, correlating with high levels of iron in this tissue, which is removed from white flours during the milling process.
