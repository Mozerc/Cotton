## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS2B02G578500](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS2B02G578500)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaARF12-2B</u>
- **Gene Name:** Auxin response factor 12
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We found that TaARF12 and TaDEP1 function in epistasis with the classical plant height Rht-1 locus.
   - TaARF12, a representative of the auxin pathway, exerts its function by interaction with the DELLA protein.
   - We identified TaARF12 as a novel plant height gene.
   - TraesCS2A01G547800 was annotated to encode an auxin response factor (ARF) with close homology to the rice ARF12 gene which is also involved in plant height development and hence was designated as TaARF12.
   - Knocked down the expression of TaARF12 by RNAi in cv. Fielder which carries the green revolution gene Rht-B1b. We found that the transgenic plants were further reduced by up to 20.7% , which occurred at each internode. Meanwhile, spikes of ARF12 RNAi plants became significantly longer leading to significantly more seeds per spike.
