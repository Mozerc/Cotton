## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS7A02G141300]()
- **Gene Symbol:** TaAVP1-7A
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome Version:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - TaAVP1 is induced under all three types of stresses and relatively higher expression was observed in tolerant genotypes. TaPAL showed down regulation after 12 h of all three stresses.
   - drought stress and salt stress 
   - TaAVP1 and transcription factors TaSHN1, TaDREB6 genes were identified as genes which have high expression under heat, drought and salt stress tolerance in wheat.
