## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1A02G010500](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS1A02G010500)
- **Gene Symbol:** Csl-1A
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Dinucleotide repeat-length polymorphism in the 5â€²UTR region of the Csl gene was associated with tiller number in diverse wheat germplasm and linked to expression differences of Csl transcripts between NILs.
   - We propose that regulation of Csl transcript and/or protein levels affects carbon partitioning throughout the plant, which plays a key role in the tin phenotype.
   - Csl transcript and/or protein levels alters carbon partitioning throughout the plant, preventing tiller-bud outgrowth and resulting in increased lignification and strength of stems in tin plants.
   - A candidate gene for tin was identified through map-based cloning and was predicted to encode a cellulose synthase-like (Csl) protein with homology to members of the CslA clade.
   - Dinucleotide repeat-length polymorphism in the 5 UTR region of the Csl gene was associated with tiller number in diverse wheat germplasm and linked to expression differences of Csl transcripts between NILs.
