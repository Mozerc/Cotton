## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1B02G477400](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS1B02G477400)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaELF3-1BL
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaELF3** genes, homologs of ELF3 in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), were cloned by a comparative genomics approach and located on homologous group 1 chromosomes, designated as TaELF3-1AL, **TaELF3-1BL**, and TaELF3-1DL.
   - **TaELF3-1DL**, a homolog of ELF3, is associated with heading date in bread wheat.
   - **TaELF3-1DLb** is associated with early HD. Thus, the functional marker can be used in wheat breeding programs.
   - A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for heading date (HD) co-segregating with **TaELF3-1DL** explained 7.7â€“20.6% of the phenotypic variance in a RIL mapping population derived from the Gaocheng 8901/Zhoumai 16 cross genotyped using the wheat 90K iSelect assay.
   - Validate function of the **TaELF3** gene on flowering by linkage mapping.
