## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS7A02G557300](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS7A02G557300)
- **Gene Symbol:** Psy1
- **Gene Name:** Phytoene synthase 1
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The accumulation of **Psy1** transcript was associated with carotenoid content in maize endosperm, thus demonstrating the significance of the gene in the grain carotenoid biosynthetic pathway.
   - In this study, the full-length genomic DNA sequence of a Psy gene (Psy-A1) located on chromosome 7A, was characterized by in silico cloning and experimental validation.
   - Characterization of phytoene synthase 1 gene (**Psy1**) located on common wheat chromosome 7A and development of a functional marker.
   - As a consequence this influences the expression of Psy-A1b leading to reduced grain YP content.
