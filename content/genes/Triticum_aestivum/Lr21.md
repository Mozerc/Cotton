## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1D02G005400](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS1D02G005400)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Lr21</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Lr21** is a potentially durable and highly effective leaf rust resistance gene in wheat.
   - Map-Based Cloning of Leaf Rust Resistance Gene **Lr21** From the Large and Polyploid Genome of Bread Wheat.
   - Cloning of **Lr21** was confirmed by genetic transformation and by a stably inherited resistance phenotype in transgenic plants.
   - **Lr21** diversity unveils footprints of wheat evolution and its new role in broad-spectrum leaf rust resistance.
   - **Lr21** is a leaf rust resistance gene, which did not enter the initial gene flow from Ae. tauschii into hexaploid wheat due to restrictive hybridization events.
