## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS4B02G020300](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS4B02G020300)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaGRP2
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaGRP2** inhibits transcript accumulation of the key flowering-promoting gene.
   - During vernalization, nuclear-localized VER2 interacts with O-GlcNAc-modified **TaGRP2** to relieve the repression on TaVRN1 transcript accumulation and to promote flowering in hexaploid winter wheat.
   - **TaGRP2** interacts with VER2 and regulates flowering in wheat.
   - O-GlcNAc-mediated interaction between VER2 and **TaGRP2** elicits TaVRN1 mRNA accumulation during vernalization in winter wheat.
   - **TaGRP2** protein accumulation in the nucleus and/or promotes **TaGRP2** dissociation from TaVRN1, leading to TaVRN1 mRNA accumulation. Our data reveal a new mechanism for sensing prolonged cold in temperate cereals.
