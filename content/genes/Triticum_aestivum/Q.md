## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS5B02G486900](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS5B02G486900)
- **Gene Symbol:** Q
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Q** confers the free-threshing character and influences many other agronomically important traits.
   - The **Q** locus played a major role in the domestication of wheat because it confers the free-threshing character and influences many other agronomically important traits.
   - AP2 is known to play a major role in controlling floral homeotic gene expression and thus is an excellent candidate for **Q**.
   - The **Q** allele and null mutations result in the speltoid spike phenotype.
   - **Q** is incompletely dominant to **Q**, and plants with the genotype **Q****Q** have a spike morphology that is intermediate to speltoid and s**Q**uare headed.
