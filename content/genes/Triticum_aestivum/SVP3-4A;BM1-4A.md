## Functional Descriptions:
   - MADS-box genes VRN1 and FUL2 (SQUAMOSA-clade) play critical and redundant roles in wheat spike and spikelet development, where they act as repressors of MADS-box genes of the SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) clade (VRT2, SVP1 and **SVP3**).
   - Here, we show that wheat vrt2 svp1 mutants are late flowering, have shorter stems, increased number of spikelets per spike and unusual axillary inflorescences in nodes of the elongating stem.
   - Constitutive expression of VRT2 resulted in leafy glumes and lemmas, reversion of basal spikelets to spikes, and down-regulation of MADS-genes involved in floral development.
   - Moreover, constitutive expression of VRT2 enhanced spikelet defects of ful2, whereas vrt2 reduced vegetative characteristics in the spikelets of vrn1 ful2 mutants heterozygous for VRN-A1.
   - These **SVP**-SQUAMOSA genetic interactions were paralleled by physical interactions among their encoded proteins. **SVP** proteins were able to reduce SQUAMOSA-SEPALLATA interactions in yeast-three-hybrid experiments.
