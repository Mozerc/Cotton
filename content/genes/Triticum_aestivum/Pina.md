## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS5D02G004100](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS5D02G004100)
- **Gene Symbol:** Pina
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The deletion of the **Pina** and Pinb genes resulted in the loss of the softness-conferring PIN proteins in durum wheat.
   - In hexaploid wheat, the tight linkage among these three genes has not been broken, such that the Ha locus haplotype (**Pina**-D1, Pinb-D1 and Gsp-D1) is associated with kernel texture phenotype.
   - Both Pin genes have been deleted from chromosomes 5A and 5B during the evolution of durum wheat (the contributor of A and B genomes of common wheat). In contrast, all three Gsp-1 genes (from the A, B and D genomes) are conserved in common wheat.
