## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1B02G004100](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS1B02G004100)
- **Gene Symbol:** Snn1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The wheat **Snn1** gene confers susceptibility to strains of the necrotrophic pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum that produce the SnTox1 protein. 
   - We report the positional cloning of **Snn1**, a member of the wall-associated kinase class of receptors, which are known to drive pathways for biotrophic pathogen resistance.
   - We cloned and characterized **Snn1** to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of susceptibility operating in plantâ€“necrotrophic pathogen interactions.
   - Recognition of SnTox1 by **Snn1** activates programmed cell death, which allows this necrotroph to gain nutrients and sporulate.
