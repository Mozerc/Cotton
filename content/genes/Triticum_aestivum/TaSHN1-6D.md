## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS6D02G209000LC]()
- **Gene Symbol:** TaSHN1-6D
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - TaSHN1 may operate as a positive modulator of drought stress tolerance.
   - Effects of overexpression of TaSHN1 on plant growth and biomass
   - Generation and selection of TaSHN1 transgenic wheat lines
   - Overexpression of TaSHN1 decreases stomatal density and reduces water loss rates
   - Overexpression of TaSHN1 increased survival of transgenic seedlings following severe drought

## Literature:
