## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS3B02G572900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** TaSINA
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - Near isogenic lines carrying the positive allele at qYDH.3BL underexpressed **TaSINA** and had increased vigour and water use efficiency early in development.
   - **TaSINA** might be a negative regulator of plant growth adaptation under heat.
   - **TaSINA** and had increased vigour and water use efficiency early in development, as well as increased biomass, grain number, and grain weight following heat stress.
