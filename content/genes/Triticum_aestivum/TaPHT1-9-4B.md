## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS4B02G317000](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=TraesCS4B02G317000)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaPHT1-9-4B
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaPHT1-9-4B** and its transcriptional regulator TaMYB4-7D contribute to phosphate uptake and plant growth in bread wheat.
   - **TaPHT1-9-4B**, a high-affinity Pi transporter highly upregulated in roots by Pi deficiency, was identified using quantitative proteomics.
   - Haplotype variation and potential value of TaPHT1;9-4B in improving Pi uptake and use efficiencies in bread wheat.
   - **TaPHT1-9-4B**, a high-affinity Pi transporter highly upregulated in roots by Pi deficiency, was identified using quantitative proteomics. Disruption of **TaPHT1-9-4B** function by BSMV-VIGS or CRISPR editing impaired wheat tolerance to Pi deprivation, whereas transgenic expression of TaPHT1;9-4B in rice improved Pi uptake and plant growth.
   - Silencing TaMYB4-7D decreased **TaPHT1-9-4B** expression, Pi uptake, and plant growth.
