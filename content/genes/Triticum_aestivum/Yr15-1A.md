- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cloning of the wheat Yr15 resistance gene sheds light on the plant tandem kinase-pseudokinase family.
   - The cloning of Yr15, a broad-spectrum R-gene derived from wild emmer wheat, which encodes a putative kinase-pseudokinase protein, designated as wheat tandem kinase 1, comprising a unique R-gene structure in wheat.
   - Yr15 confers broad-spectrum resistance against a worldwide collection of more than 3000 genetically diverse Pst isolates, including modern races, such as ‘Warrior’ (race DK09/11), which is currently threatening wheat production.
   - The identification of the Yr15 gene sequence by map-based cloning and demonstrate its function in conferring resistance to yellow rust in durum and common wheats, by both ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of resistant Yr15 introgression lines (ILs) and transgenic complementation of susceptible varieties.
