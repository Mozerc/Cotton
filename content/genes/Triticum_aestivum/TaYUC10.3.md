## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=)
- **Gene Symbol:** TaYUC10.3
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaYUC10.3** was expressed in a large amount in young seeds of the transgenic lines. Plant hormone-targeted metabolomics showed that the auxin content of the transgenic lines was significantly increased compared with controls.
   - Seed-specific expression of TaYUC10 significantly increases auxin and protein content in wheat seeds.
   - The increased auxin is due to either **TaYUC10.3**-catalyzed tryptophan to form indole acetone or the conversion of auxin and trans-zeatin anabolic pathways.
   - Present study revealed that specific expression of **TaYUC10.3** in wheat young seeds could increase the content of auxin, and protein.
