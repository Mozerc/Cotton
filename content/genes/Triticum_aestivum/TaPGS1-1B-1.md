## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[TraesCS1B02G112900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** TaPGS1-1B-1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Description:
   - Our results reveal that TaPGS1 functions as a valuable trait-associated gene for improving cereal grain yield.
   - Overexpression (OE) of TaPGS1 in wheat and rice resulted in altered expression levels of seed-development-related genes and increased grain weight and grain size in field tests.
   - TaPGS1 increased grain weight and size in wheat and rice
