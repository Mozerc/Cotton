## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [BnaC03G0156800ZS]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnaC03.FBA</u>
- **Gene Name:** FBox-associated
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **BnaC03.FBA** and BnaC03.EFO1 genes exhibited a tissue-specific pattern in the NIL-CH line, consistent with information regarding their gene expression in the Brassica Gene Expression Database.
   - These results indicate that the altered **BnaC03.FBA** expression pattern was responsible for the closed petal phenotype.
   - This indicated that BnaC06.SKP13 and **BnaC03.FBA** have overlapping expression patterns in NIL-CL petals at the key stages of petal maturation.
   - The upregulation of **BnaC03.FBA** in petals at flower development stages 13 and 14 led to closed petals; it also altered plant hormone signaling, such as ethylene, jasmonic acid, and auxin signal transduction, in the transgenic buds of plants with closed flowers.
