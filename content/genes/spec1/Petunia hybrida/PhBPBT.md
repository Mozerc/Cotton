## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhBPBT</u>
- **Gene Name:** benzoyl CoA:benzyl alcohol/phenylethanol benzoyltransferase
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Petunia hybrida*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tissue-specific **PhBPBT** expression is differentially regulated in response to endogenous ethylene.
   - RNAi-silenced lines, with reduced **PhBPBT** transcript, displayed reduced benzyl benzoate emission, and increased benzyl alcohol levels.
   - Ethylene is also emitted from vegetative tissue of petunia following mechanical wounding, resulting in an increase in **PhBPBT** expression in the leaves where expression is normally below detection levels.
   - Indicative of this pattern of expression, we hypothesize that **PhBPBT** and subsequent benzyl benzoate production is involved in defence-related processes in the corolla prior to pollination, in the ovary immediately following fertilization, and in vegetative tissue in response to wounding.
