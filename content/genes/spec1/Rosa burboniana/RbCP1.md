## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>RbCP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** cysteine protease 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Rosa burboniana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptional activation of a 37 kDa ethylene responsive cysteine protease gene, **RbCP1**, is associated with protein degradation during petal abscission in rose.
   - A cysteine protease gene, **RbCP1**, has been identified that encodes a putative protein of 357 amino acids and is expressed in the abscission zone (AZ) of petals in rose.
   - The expression of **RbCP1** increased during both ethylene-induced as well as natural abscission and was inhibited by 1-MCP.
   - It is concluded that petal abscission is associated with a decrease in total protein content resulting from rapid transcription of **RbCP1** and the expression of a 37 kDa protease.
