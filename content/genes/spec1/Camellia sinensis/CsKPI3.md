## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsKPI3</u>
- **Gene Name:** Kunitz protease inhibitor 3
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The overall findings suggest that the transcriptional divergence of KPI genes after duplication led to the specialized role of CsKPI1 in the physiological response to insect stress; the functional conservation between CsKPI2 and **CsKPI3** confers resistance to pathogen infection in tea plant.
   - We showed that salicylic acid (SA) and transcripts of CsKPI2 and **CsKPI3** significantly accumulated after infection with Glomerella cingulata. The application of exogenous SA stimulated the high expression of both CsKPI2 and **CsKPI3** by activating cis-elements within their promoters.
   - Specifically, the expression of CsKPI2 and **CsKPI3** reached peaks of up to 26.5-fold and 7.6-fold higher than those of the control at 10 days post inoculation, respectively; however, CsKPI1 was only 1.1-fold expression at 10 days post inoculation, suggesting the functional diversity among them in response to pathogen infection.
   - The results showed that CsKPI2p - and **CsKPI3**p-driven GFP were strongly expressed in SA-treated protoplast cells but not in untreated cells.
   - The functional conservation between CsKPI2 and **CsKPI3** confers resistance to pathogen infection in tea plant.
