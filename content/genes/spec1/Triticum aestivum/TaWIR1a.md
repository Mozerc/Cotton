## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaWIR1a</u>
- **Gene Name:** Wheat-Induced Resistance 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - TaWIR1 contributes to post-penetration resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae, but not Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, in wheat.
   - Transcripts of all three TaWIR1 genes were strongly induced by a wheat-adapted isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - Virus-induced gene silencing of the TaWIR1 gene family had no effect on the initial penetration of epidermal cells by M.oryzae.
   - Silencing of TaWIR1 transcripts had no effect on epidermal cell penetration by a wheat-adapted isolate of Blumeria graminis, or on the subsequent growth of hyphae.
   - Differential transcription of TaWIR1 genes was also seen in epidermal peels, relative to the remaining leaf tissue, following inoculation with M.oryzae.
