## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NaMKK1</u>
- **Gene Name:** mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Nicotiana attenuata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases, MKK1 and MEK2, are involved in wounding- and specialist lepidopteran herbivore Manduca sexta-induced responses in Nicotiana attenuata.
   - The homologues of MKK1 and MEK2 were cloned in N. attenuata (**NaMKK1** and NaMEK2) and a virus-induced gene silencing approach was used to knock-down the transcript levels of these MAPKK genes.
   - Both NaMEK2 and **NaMKK1** regulate the levels of trypsin proteinase inhibitors.
   - Silencing **NaMKK1** and NaMEK2 in N. attenuata compromises NaTPI activity.
