## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VaXTH2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 2
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Phaseolus angularis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two Azuki Bean XTH Genes, VaXTH1 and **VaXTH2**, with Similar Tissue-Specific Expression Profiles, are Differently Regulated by Auxin.
   - VaXTH1 and **VaXTH2**, which share a striking resemblance in their amino acid sequences. The two XTH genes exhibit essentially similar tissue-specific expression profiles, in that both mRNAs are found predominantly in the phloem fibers of growing internodes.
   - Whereas VaXTH1 is expressed in xylem cells in the basal part of the internode, little or no expression of **VaXTH2** is found in the xylem.
   - The IAA-induced up-regulation of the **VaXTH2** gene is not affected by mannitol.
