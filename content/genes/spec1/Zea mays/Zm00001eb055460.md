## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb055460]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmphyA1</u>
- **Gene Name:** phytochromeA1
- **Genome:** Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmphyA1** and ZmphyA2, like other plant phytochromes, possess a highly conserved domain structure.
   - The transcript levels of **ZmphyA1**/ZmPHYA2 were significantly higher in the third and sixth leaves but lower in roots, stems, and leaf sheaths, indicating that ZmphyA proteins were strictly controlled by light.
   - **ZmphyA1** and ZmphyA2 were uniformly localized in the cytoplasm in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells in darkness but translocated into the nucleus and formed nuclear bodies in response to light, consistent with the notion that phytochromes are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling photoreceptors.
   - ZmphyAs were degraded rapidly in response to R and W light, but the degradation was much slower in FR light. These results verify that ZmphyAs are light labile.
