## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb237270]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>sxd1</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose export defective1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tie-dyed1 and Sucrose export defective1 act independently to promote carbohydrate export from maize leaves.
   - As tdy1 and **sxd1** are the only variegated leaf mutants known to accumulate carbohydrates in any plant, we investigated whether Tdy1 and **sxd1** function in the same pathway.
   - Double mutant plants showed an additive interaction for growth related phenotypes and soluble sugar accumulation, and expressed the leaf variegation pattern of both single mutants indicating that Tdy1 and **sxd1** act in separate genetic pathways.
   - Tdy1 and **sxd1** function independently to promote carbon export from leaves. Our genetic and cytological studies implicate Tdy1 functioning in veins, and a model discussing possible functions of TDY1 is presented.
