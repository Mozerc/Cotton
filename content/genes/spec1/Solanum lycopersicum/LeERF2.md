## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LeERF2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Ethylene response factor 2
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptional Regulation of the Ethylene Response Factor **LeERF2** in the Expression of Ethylene Biosynthesis Genes Controls Ethylene Production in Tomato and Tobacco.
   - **LeERF2**, an allele of TERF2, was reported to confer ethylene triple response on plants.
   - **LeERF2**/TERF2 is an important regulator in the expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes and the production of ethylene. Expression analysis revealed that **LeERF2**/TERF2 is ethylene inducible, and ethylene production stimulated by ethylene was suppressed in antisense **LeERF2**/TERF2 transgenic tomato, indicating **LeERF2**/TERF2 to be a positive regulator in the feedback loop of ethylene induction.
   - **LeERF2**/TERF2 conservatively modulates ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco and that such regulation in tobacco is associated with the elongation of the hypocotyl and insensitivity to abscisic acid and glucose during germination and seedling development.
   - Biochemical analysis showed that **LeERF2**/TERF2 interacted with GCC box in the promoter of NtACS3 and with dehydration-responsive element in the promoter of LeACO3, resulting in transcriptional activation of the genes for ethylene biosynthesis in tomato and tobacco, which is a novel regulatory function of ERF proteins in plant ethylene biosynthesis.
