## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlCPT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** cis–prenyltransferase1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcripts of SlCPT2, SlCPT4, SlCPT5 and SlCPT7 are present at low levels in multiple tissues, SlCPT6 is exclusively expressed in red fruit and roots, and **SlCPT1**, SlCPT3 and SlCPT7 are highly expressed in trichomes.
   - Phylogenetic analysis revealed CPT gene families in both eudicots and monocots, and showed that all the short-chain CPT genes from tomato (**SlCPT1**, SlCPT2 and SlCPT6) are closely linked to terpene synthase gene clusters.
   - Impact of **SlCPT1** knockdown on tomato leaf terpenes.
   - Function and evolution of **SlCPT1**, SlCPT2 and SlCPT6, the short-chain cis–prenyldiphosphate synthases.
   - **SlCPT1** and SlCPT2 are embedded in a cluster of terpene synthase genes on chromosome 8, one of which (PHS1) uses the product of **SlCPT1** (NPP) to produce β–phellandrene, the major monoterpene found in tomato trichomes.
