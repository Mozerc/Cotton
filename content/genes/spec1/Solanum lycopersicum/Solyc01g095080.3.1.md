## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc01g095080.3.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LeACS2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 2
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Turnover of **LeACS2**, a wound-inducible 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in tomato, is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.
   - Demonstrate that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of **LeACS2** regulates its turnover upstream of the ubiquitin-26S-proteasome degradation pathway.
   - The amount of **LeACS2** affected by the protein kinase/phosphatase inhibitors significantly influenced cellular ACS activity, ACC content, and ethylene production levels in tomato fruit tissue, suggesting that post-translational regulation by phosphorylation plays an important role in the control of ethylene production.
   - **LeACS2** was immediately phosphorylated after translation by CDPK and mitogen-activated protein kinase at different sites in response to wound signaling and almost all functional **LeACS2** molecules are phosphorylated in the cell. Phosphorylation at both sites was required for **LeACS2** stability.
