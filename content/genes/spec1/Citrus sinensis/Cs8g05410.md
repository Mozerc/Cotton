## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Cs8g05410]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsCCoAOMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase 1
- **Genome:** [Citrus sinensis reference genome](https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/citrus_downloads/Citrus_sinensis/C.sinensis_Hzau_v1.0_genome/)
- **Species:** *Citrus sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A multifunctional true caffeoyl coenzyme A O-methyltransferase (**CsCCoAOMT1**) enzyme  participates in the biosynthesis of polymethoxylated flavones in citrus.
   - Characterized a true caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (named **CsCCoAOMT1**) from C. sinensis. Functional analysis in vitro showed that **CsCCoAOMT1** preferred flavonoids to caffeoyl-CoA and esculetin.
   - The transient overexpression and virus-induced gene silencing experiments verified that **CsCCoAOMT1** could promote the accumulation of PMFs in citrus. 
   - These results reveal the function of true CCoAOMTs and indicate that **CsCCoAOMT1** is a highly efficient multifunctional O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of PMFs in citrus.
