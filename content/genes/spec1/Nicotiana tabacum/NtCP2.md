## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NtCP2</u>
- **Gene Name:** cysteine protease 2
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **NtCP2** has a high similarity to KDEL-tailed cysteine proteinases and is expressed in mature green leaves.
   - Both drought and heat decreased **NtCP2** transcript abundance in mature green leaves.
   - It is concluded that NtCP1 is a senescence-specific cysteine proteinase whereas **NtCP2** fulfils roles in green leaves that might be similar to those of KDEL-tailed cysteine proteinases involved, for example, in programmed cell death.
   - NtCP1 and **NtCP2** are differentially expressed in response to abiotic stress. They belong to two distinct subgroups within the papain-like family of cysteine proteinases.
