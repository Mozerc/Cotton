## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa5G606550]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NRP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** nodulin-related protein 1
- **Genome:** [Cucurbit Genomics Database](http://cucurbitgenomics.org/)
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Comparative gene expression analysis revealed that nodulin-related protein 1 (**NRP1**) may be a good candidate for PM resistance.
   - The increased expression in PM-inoculated leaves of SSL508-28 (IS) suggested an important role for **NRP1** in PM defense.
   - The relative expression of **NRP1** was significantly higher in IS than in the NIS leaves at 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment; the peak expression occurred at 48 h after inoculation.
   - It can be inferred that the upregulation of **NRP1** might act as a positive regulator and contribute to cucumber PM resistance by regulating ABA synthesis.
