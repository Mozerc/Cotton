## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TasHyd1</u>
- **Gene Name:** hydrophobin 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Trichoderma asperellum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TasHyd1**, a new hydrophobin gene from the biocontrol agent Trichoderma asperellum, is involved in plant root colonization.
   - Carbon limitation stimulates expression of **TasHyd1** whereas nitrogen or phosphate starvation down-regulate expression.
   - **TasHyd1** fused to an HA tag was over-expressed in Trichoderma and the protein was detected with an anti-HA antibody in the trifluoroacetic-acid-soluble fraction of mycelial cell walls.
   - **TasHyd1** deletion mutants had no significant reduction in in vitro mycoparasitic activity but were altered in their wettability and were severely impaired in root attachment and colonization.
   - These phenotypes were recovered by complementation of **TasHyd1**, indicating that the protein is a new hydrophobin that contributes to Trichoderma interaction with the plant.
