## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>WS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** WOX-SPINE1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Lactuca serriola*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A gene encoding WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor, named as WOX-SPINE1 (**WS1**), was identified as the candidate gene controlling the spine development in lettuce, and its function on spines was verified.
   - A CACTA transposon was found to be inserted into the first exon of the **WS1** allele, knocking out its function and leading to the lack of spines in cultivated lettuce.
   - All lettuce cultivars investigated have the nonfunctional **WS1** gene, and a selection sweep was found at the **WS1** locus, suggesting its important role in lettuce domestication.
   - The expression levels of **WS1** were associated with the density of spines among different accessions of wild lettuce. At least two independent loss-of-function mutations in the **WS1** gene caused the loss of spines in wild lettuce.
