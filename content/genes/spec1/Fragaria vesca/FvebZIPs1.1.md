## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FvebZIPs1.1</u>
- **Gene Name:** basic leucine zipper transcription factor s1.1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Fragaria vesca*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Engineering the conserved SC-uORF of **FvebZIPs1.1** is an efficient way to increase sugar content in strawberry.
   - It is possible that the increased sugar content of the mutants leads to repression of **FvebZIPs1.1** mRNA transcription, as previously reported in Arabidopsis.
   - The appearance of the **FvebZIPs1.1** uORF mutants was healthy, their leaf shapes and leaf areas, which are determined by the length and width of the mature leaves, were the same as in the wild-type, and no dwarfed plants, slow growth rates, and failed pollination were observed.
   - These results indicate that the increased sugar content of the **FvebZIPs1.1** uORF mutants is not accompanied by negative traits that reduce the economic value of strawberry, suggesting that our strategy can be used to improve the sugar quality of fruits.
