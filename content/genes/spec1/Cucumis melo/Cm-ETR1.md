## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Cm-ETR1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene receptor 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In fully enlarged fruit the level of Cm-ERS1 mRNA was low in all tissues, whereas that of **Cm-ETR1** mRNA was very high in the seeds and placenta.
   - During ripening Cm-ERS1 mRNA increased slightly in the pericarp of fruit before the marked increase of **Cm-ETR1** mRNA paralleled climacteric ethylene production.
   - The level of **Cm-ETR1** mRNA was high in the seed and placenta of developing and fully enlarged fruit, whereas the increase of the mRNA level in the pericarp of fruit was concurrent with the beginning of ethylene production during ripening.
   - These results indicate that both **Cm-ETR1** andCm-ERS1 play specific roles not only in ripening but also in the early development of melon fruit and that they have distinct roles in particular fruit tissues at particular developmental stages.
