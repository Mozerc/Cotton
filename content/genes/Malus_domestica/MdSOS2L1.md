## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdSOS2L1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Malus x domestica Whole Genome v1.0 Assembly & Annotation](https://www.rosaceae.org/species/malus/malus_x_domestica/genome_v1.0)
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MdSOS2L1** was found to be involved in the regulation of malate excretion, and to inhibit cadmium uptake into roots.
   - Using the DUAL membrane system in a screen of an apple cDNA library with **MdSOS2L1** as bait, a malate transporter, MdALMT14, was identified as an interactor.
   - **MdSOS2L1** was also shown to enhance cadmium tolerance in an MdALMT14-dependent manner.
   - Transgenic analyses showed that **MdSOS2L1** is required for cadmium-induced phosphorylation at the Ser358 site of MdALMT14, a modification that enhanced the stability of the MdALMT14 protein. **MdSOS2L1** was also shown to enhance cadmium tolerance in an MdALMT14-dependent manner.
   - **MdSOS2L1** overexpressing plants showed improved Cd tolerance and increased malate accumulation/excretion.
