## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[MD05G1283600]()
- **Gene Symbol:** MdCacyBP
- **Gene Name:** Malus domestica calcyclin-binding protein
- **Genome:** [Malus × domestica GDDH13 v1.1](https://www.rosaceae.org/species/malus/malus_x_domestica/genome_v1.0)
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MdCacyBP** interacts with and ubiquitinates MdFRK2 to facilitate its degradation by the 26S proteasome, thus decreasing the FRK enzyme activity to elevate fructose concentration in transgenic apple trees.
   - Further analyses suggested an **MdCacyBP**–MdFRK2 regulatory module, in which **MdCacyBP** interacts with and ubiquitinates MdFRK2 to facilitate its degradation by the 26S proteasome, thus decreasing the FRK enzyme activity to elevate fructose concentration in transgenic apple trees.
   - This proposed **MdCacyBP**–MdFRK2 regulatory module is an important mechanism by which plant fructose homeostasis is controlled at the organ level by regulating MdFRK2 protein levels through ubiquitination and degradation.
   - **MdCacyBP** ubiquitinated MdFRK2 and accelerated its degradation.
   - **MdCacyBP**–MdFRK2 regulatory model is crucial for regulating fructose accumulation.
