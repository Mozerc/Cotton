## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[MD14G1239500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdGORK1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Malus x domestica Whole Genome v1.0 Assembly & Annotation](https://www.rosaceae.org/species/malus/malus_x_domestica/genome_v1.0)
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We characterized the transporter genes **MdGORK1** and MdNHX2 as downstream targets of MdWRKY53 by ChIP-seq. 
   - **MdGORK1** localized to the plasma membrane and enhanced K+ efflux to increase KCl tolerance in transgenic apple plants.
   - RT–qPCR and LUC activity analyses indicated that MdWRKY53 binds to the promoters of **MdGORK1** and MdNHX2 and induces their transcription.
   - Overexpressing MdWRKY53 enhanced KCl tolerance in transgenic apple plants by increasing K+ efflux and K+ compartmentalization. Subsequently, we characterized the transporter genes **MdGORK1** and MdNHX2 as downstream targets of MdWRKY53 by ChIP-seq. **MdGORK1** localized to the plasma membrane and enhanced K+ efflux to increase KCl tolerance in transgenic apple plants. Moreover, overexpressing MdNHX2 enhanced the KCl tolerance of transgenic apple plants/callus by compartmentalizing K+ into the vacuole. RT–qPCR and LUC activity analyses indicated that MdWRKY53 binds to the promoters of **MdGORK1** and MdNHX2 and induces their transcription.
