## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[MD15G1235900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdAMR1L1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Asc Mannose pathway Regulator 1 Like 1
- **Genome:** [Malus × domestica GDDH13 v1.1](https://www.rosaceae.org/species/malus/malus_x_domestica/genome_v1.0)
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - F-box protein **MdAMR1L1** regulates ascorbate biosynthesis in apple by modulating GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase.
   - This occurred because the **MdAMR1L1** protein interacted with MdGMP1 and promoted its degradation via the ubiquitination pathway to inhibit Asc synthesis at the post-translational level.
   - The overexpression or silencing of **MdAMR1L1** in apple indicated that **MdAMR1L1** negatively regulated Asc levels.
   - This occurred because the **MdAMR1L1** protein interacted with MdGMP1 and promoted its degradation via the ubiquitination pathway to inhibit Asc synthesis at the post-translational level. MdERF98, an apple ethylene response factor, whose transcription was modulated by Asc level, is directly bound to the promoter of MdGMP1 to promote the transcription of MdGMP1.
