## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdDIPM4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Malus domestica DspA/E-interacting proteins of M.4
- **Genome:** [Malus x domestica Whole Genome v1.0 Assembly & Annotation](https://www.rosaceae.org/species/malus/malus_x_domestica/genome_v1.0)
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The bacterium Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of fire blight disease in apple, triggers its infection through the DspA/E effector which interacts with the apple susceptibility protein **MdDIPM4**.
   - **MdDIPM4** knockout has been produced in two Malus × domestica susceptible cultivars using the CRISPR/Cas9 system delivered via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Fifty-seven transgenic lines were screened to identify CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations.
   - **MdDIPM4** is involved in apple susceptibility to fire blight and that the inactivation of this single gene of the DIPM family is sufficient to significantly reduce disease symptoms.
   - The knockout of **MdDIPM4** resulted in a highly significant reduction in susceptibility, on average 50% in both cultivars.
