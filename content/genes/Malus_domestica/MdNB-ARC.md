## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[MD09G1272500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdNB-ARC</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Malus x domestica Whole Genome v1.0 Assembly & Annotation](https://www.rosaceae.org/species/malus/malus_x_domestica/genome_v1.0)
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We found that **MdNB-ARC** OE transgenic apple plants exhibited greater anthocyanin accumulation than the wild-type (GL-3) plants when 6% sucrose was added to the medium.
   - Overexpression of **MdNB-ARC** involved in plant defence signalling pathway leading to red apple fruit maybe through the WRYK family.
   - An apple ERECTA-like gene that underwent selection during domestication on 15th chromosome was identified as a likely major determinant of fruit length and diameter, and an NB-ARC domain-containing gene was found to strongly affect anthocyanin accumulation using a genome-wide association approach.
