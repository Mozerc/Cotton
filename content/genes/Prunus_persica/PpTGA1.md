## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[]()
- **Gene Symbol:** PpTGA1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [peach reference genome v2.0.a1]()
- **Species:** *Prunus persica*

## Functional Description:
   - Here, we found that 50 mM β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) treatment could induce two distinct pathways linked with TGA1-related systemic acquired resistance (SAR), resulting in the alleviation of Rhizopus rot in postharvest peach fruit.
   - The first priming phase was elicited by BABA alone, leading to the enhanced transcription of redox-regulated genes and posttranslational modification of **PpTGA1**. The second phase was activated by an H2O2 burst via up-regulation of PpRBOH genes and stimulation of the MAPK cascade on pathogen invasion, resulting in a robust defence.
   - In a preliminary trial, a novel group C MAPK kinase of PpMAPKK5 was identified as a **PpTGA1** binding partner that was positively involved in induced resistance against R. stolonifer in peaches.
