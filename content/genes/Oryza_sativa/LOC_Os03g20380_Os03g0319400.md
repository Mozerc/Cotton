## Functional Descriptions:
   - To determine the physiological roles of **OsCIPK31** in rice plants, the sensitivity of **OsCIPK31**::Ds, which is a transposon Ds insertion mutant, to abiotic stresses was examined during germination and seedling stages.
   - In addition, **OsCIPK31**::Ds seedlings exhibited enhanced expression of several stress-responsive genes after exposure to these abiotic stresses.
   - This study demonstrated that rice plants use **OsCIPK31** to modulate responses to abiotic stresses during the seed germination and seedling stages and to modulate the expression of stress-responsive genes.
   - **OsCIPK31**, a CBL-interacting protein kinase is involved in germination and seedling growth under abiotic stress conditions in rice plants.
   - Transgenic plants overexpressing the transgenes Os**CIPK03**, OsCIPK12, and OsCIPK15 showed significantly improved tolerance to cold, drought, and salt stress, respectively.
   - Sequence analysis indicated that the open reading frame of the **OsCK1** gene consists of 1350 bp encoding 449 amino acid residues, which is very similar to a family of calcineurin B-like protein (CBL)-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) or salt overly sensitive 2 (SOS2)-like protein kinases (PKS) in Arabidopsis.
   - Expression of the **OsCK1** gene was detected mainly in the shoots and highly inducible by diverse signals such as cold, light, salt, sugar and cytokinins.
   - Under cold and drought stresses, Os**CIPK03**- and OsCIPK12-overexpressing transgenic plants accumulated significantly higher contents of proline and soluble sugars than the wild type.
   - **OsCIPK31**::Ds mutants exhibited hypersensitive phenotypes to ABA, salt, mannitol, and glucose.
   - However, the expression of ABA metabolic genes and the endogenous levels of ABA were not altered significantly in the **OsCIPK31**::Ds mutant.
   - Our results support that **OsCIPK31** plays an important role in panicle development.
   - We found that dysregulation is caused by the disruption of **OsCIPK31** function due to excessive accumulation of ROS, which ultimately leads to cell death in rice panicle.
   - Our study provides an understanding of the role of **OsCIPK31** in panicle development by responding to various stresses and phytohormones.
