## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsACP1** expression was up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell culture in the absence of phosphate (Pi).
   - **OsACP1** expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of **OsACP1** being abundant in Pi-deprived root.
   - The **OsACP1** cDNA was expressed as a 30 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells.
   - The induced expression of **OsACP1** was a specific response to Pi starvation, and was not affected by the deprivation of other nutrients.
   - Overexpression or mutation of **OsACP1** affected Po degradation and utilization, which further influenced plant growth and productivity under both Pi-sufficient and Pi-deficient conditions.
   - We concluded that **OsACP1** is an active acid phosphatase that regulates rice growth under Pi stress conditions by recycling Pi from Po in the ER and GA.
   - **OsACP1** expression is specifically induced in almost all cell types of leaves and roots under Pi stress conditions.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **OsACP1** significantly affected intracellular Pi homeostasis and Pi starvation signalling.
   - **OsACP1** encodes an acid phosphatase with broad Po substrates and localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA).
   - Phylogenic analysis demonstrates that **OsACP1** has a similar structure with human acid phosphatase PHOSPHO1.
