## Functional Descriptions:
   - The SUN domain proteins OsSUN1 and **OsSUN2** play critical but partially redundant roles in meiosis.
   - The Ossun1 **OsSUN2** double mutant showed severe defects in telomere clustering, homologous pairing and crossover formation, suggesting that OsSUN1 and **OsSUN2** are essential for rice meiosis.
   - Importantly, the Ossun1 single mutant had a normal phenotype but meiosis was disrupted in the **OsSUN2** mutant, indicating that OsSUN1 and **OsSUN2** are not completely redundant in rice.
   - These results suggested that **OsSUN2** plays a more critical role than OsSUN1 in rice meiosis.
   - Taken together, this work reveals the essential but partially redundant roles of OsSUN1 and **OsSUN2** in rice meiosis and demonstrates that functional divergence of SUN proteins has taken place during evolution.
   - When introducing a mutant allele of OsSPORULATION11 (OsSPO11)-1, which encodes a topoisomerase initiating homologous recombination, into the Ossun1 **OsSUN2** mutant, we observed a combined Osspo11-1- and Ossun1 **OsSUN2**-like phenotype, demonstrating that OsSUN1 and **OsSUN2** promote bouquet formation independent of OsSPO11-1, but regulate pairing and crossover formation downstream of OsSPO11-1.
