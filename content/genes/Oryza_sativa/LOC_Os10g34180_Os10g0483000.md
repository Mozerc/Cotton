## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g34180](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g34180)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0483000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0483000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsBTF3,Osj10gBTF3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of **Osj10gBTF3** was primarily constitutive and generally modulated by salt, high temperature and exogenous phytohormone stress.
   - Inhibition of a basal transcription factor 3-like gene **Osj10gBTF3** in rice results in significant plant miniaturization and typical pollen abortion.
   - Our demonstration of the important role of **Osj10gBTF3** in rice growth and development provides new insights showing that more complex regulatory functions are associated with BTF3 in plants.
   - Knockout of **Osj10gBTF3** affects pollen and chloroplast development and significantly reduces the accumulation of fertility-related chloroplast protein OsPPR676.
   - Interestingly, the interaction between OsHSP82 and OsPPR676 is only found in the cytoplasm, while the interaction between **Osj10gBTF3** and OsPPR676 also occurs inside the chloroplast.
   - Further investigation indicates that **Osj10gBTF3** enters the chloroplast stroma possibly through the inner chloroplast membrane channel protein Tic110 and then recruits OsCpn60 for the folding or assembly of OsPPR676.
   - Our results reveal a chaperone role of **Osj10gBTF3** in chloroplast import different from Hsp90 and provide a link between chloroplast transport and pollen development in rice.
