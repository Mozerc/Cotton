- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcripts of **Udt1**, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis.
   - Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in **Udt1** and pair1 mutants.
   - These results revealed that the expression of TDR (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and **Udt1** (undeveloped tapetum1).
   - While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in tdr and **Udt1**-1, and no apparent expression fold change of **Udt1** in tdr and gamyb-4, suggesting that TDR may act downstream of GAMYB and **Udt1**, and GAMYB and **Udt1** work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development.
   - Here, we report the identification of rice (Oryza sativa) Undeveloped Tapetum1 (**Udt1**), which is required for the differentiation of secondary parietal cells to mature tapetal cells.
   - DNA microarray analysis identified 958 downregulated and 267 upregulated genes in the **Udt1**-1 anthers, suggesting that **Udt1** plays a major role in maintaining tapetum development, starting in early meiosis.
   - This, together with its homology with other basic helix-loop-helix proteins, suggests that **Udt1** is a transcription factor.
   - These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before **Udt1**, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1.
   - T-DNA or retrotransposon Tos17 insertions in the **Udt1** gene caused male sterility.
   - In addition, we uncover a possible mechanism by which GA regulates male fertility: SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) interacts with and sequesters two critical transcription factors for tapetum development, UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (**Udt1**), and TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), and GA alleviates the sequestration by SLR1, thus allowing **Udt1** and TDR to activate transcription.
