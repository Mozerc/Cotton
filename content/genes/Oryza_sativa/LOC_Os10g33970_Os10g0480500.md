## Functional Descriptions:
   - qRT-PCR analysis of 29 related genes suggested that defects of the **OsDRB2**-miR166-OsHBs pathway could play an important role in formation of the rolled leaf phenotype of rl89, in which **OsDRB2** mutation reduced miR166 accumulation, resulting in elevated expressions of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes (such as OsHB1, 3 and 5) involved in leaf polarity and/or morphology development.
   - Moreover, **OsDRB2** mutation also reduced accumulation of miR160, miR319, miR390, and miR396, which could cause the abnormal leaf development in rl89 by regulating expressions of their target genes related to leaf development.
   - The **SRL10** mutant had a semi-rolled leaf phenotype and elevated sensitivity to high temperature.
   - The natural Hap3 (AGC) type of **SRL10** allele was found to be present in the majority of aus rice accessions, and was identified as a thermotolerant allele under high temperature stress in both the field and the growth chamber.
   - **SRL10** directly interacted with catalase isozyme B (CATB), and the two proteins mutually increased one other&#x27;s stability to enhance hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) scavenging, thereby contributing to thermotolerance.
