## Functional Descriptions:
   - Spin1 overexpression causes late flowering independently of daylength; expression analyses of flowering marker genes in these lines suggested that SPIN1 represses flowering by downregulating the flowering promoter gene Heading date3a (Hd3a) via **Hd1**-dependent mechanisms in short days and by targeting **Hd1**-independent factors in long days.
   - The CONSTANS (CO) and Heading date 1 (**Hd1**) genes are known to be central integrators of the photoperiod pathway in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively.
   - The expression of Hd3a and FTL decreased in these transgenic plants, whereas the expression of **Hd1**, Early heading date 1 (E**Hd1**), OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 did not significantly change.
   - RT-PCR analyses of the OsMADS50 KO and ubiquitin (ubi):OsMADS50 plants showed that OsMADS50 is an upstream regulator of OsMADS1, OsMADS14, OsMADS15, OsMADS18, and Hd (Heading date)3a, but works either parallel with or downstream of **Hd1** and O.
   - Therefore, two key flowering time genes, **Hd1** and E**Hd1**, can control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the field through florigen expression in leaf.
   - Meanwhile, the transcription of DTH8 has been proved to be independent of Ghd7 and **Hd1**, and the natural mutation of this gene caused weak photoperiod sensitivity and shorter plant height.
   - In addition, QTLs near Hd2, **Hd1**6, and Ghd7, which are involved in inhibition of heading under long-day conditions, function in the same pathway that controls heading date.
   - The results revealed that the combination of Heading-date 1 (**Hd1**) and Early heading date 1 (E**Hd1**) can reduce the number of primary branches in a panicle, resulting in smaller spikelet numbers per panicle; this occurs independently of the control of flowering time.
   - Flowering genes downstream of OsPRR1 such as OsGI and **Hd1** were down regulated in the A654 mutant.
   - Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and **Hd1** by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering.
   - A single NB strongly suppressed the mRNA of Hd3a, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), whereas the mRNAs of OsGI and **Hd1** were not affected.
   - Since the photoperiod-insensitive allele of **Hd1** confers a long vegetative phase, it is a good candidate for breeding rice varieties with high yielding potential for low latitudes.
   - The RNA levels of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), encoding a floral activator, are highly correlated with flowering time, and there is a high degree of polymorphism in the Heading date 1 (**Hd1**) protein, which is a major regulator of Hd3a expression.
   - Functional and nonfunctional alleles of **Hd1** are associated with early and late flowering, respectively, suggesting that **Hd1** is a major determinant of variation in flowering time of cultivated rice.
   - We also found that the type of Hd3a promoter and the level of E**Hd1** expression contribute to the diversity in flowering time and Hd3a expression level.
   - Variations in **Hd1** proteins, Hd3a promoters, and E**Hd1** expression levels contribute to diversity of flowering time in cultivated rice.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the rice flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading date 16 (**Hd1**6) encodes a casein kinase-I protein.
   - Heading date 1 (**Hd1**), a regulator of the florigen gene Hd3a, is one of the main factors used to generate diversity in flowering.
   - Loss-of-function alleles of **Hd1** are common in cultivated rice and cause the diversity of flowering time.
   - In contrast with Hd3a, which has been highly conserved, **Hd1** may have undergone human selection to diversify the flowering times of rice during domestication or the early stage of the cultivation period.
   - Heading date 1 (**Hd1**), an ortholog of Arabidopsis CONSTANS, is a possible target of human selection during domestication to diversify flowering times of cultivated rice.
   - We further revealed that **Hd1** and/or E**Hd1** caused up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle development.
   - The comparison of the nucleotide sequences suggested that Ef1 is the same as Early heading date 1 (E**Hd1**).
   - The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of E**Hd1** (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions.
   - The Early heading date 1 (E**Hd1**) which promotes the RFT1, was up-regulated by DTH3 in both LD and SD conditions.
   - Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating E**Hd1**.
   - By using near-isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering-time genes, we observed significant digenetic interactions between **Hd1**6 and four other flowering-time genes (Ghd7, **Hd1**, DTH8 and Hd2).
   - These results demonstrate that **Hd1**6 acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of the phosphorylation of Ghd7.
   - **Hd1**6, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response.
   - Characterization and detection of epistatic interactions of 3 QTLs, **Hd1** , Hd2 , and Hd3, controlling heading date in rice using nearly isogenic lines.
   - We grew four rice lines having different flowering time genotypes (**Hd1** e**Hd1**, **Hd1** E**Hd1**, **Hd1** e**Hd1** and **Hd1** E**Hd1**) under distinct photoperiod conditions.
   - In addition, expression of the Hd3a and Rice Flowering-locus T 1 (RFT1) florigen genes was up-regulated in leaves of the **Hd1** E**Hd1** line at the time of the floral transition.
   - They were used to analyze the effects of **Hd1** on heading date, plant height and yield traits.
   - Pleiotropism of the photoperiod-insensitive allele of **Hd1** on heading date, plant height and yield traits in rice.
   - We examined the footprints of natural and artificial selections for four major genes of the photoperiod pathway, namely PHYTOCHROME B (PhyB), HEADING DATE 1 (**Hd1**), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a), and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (E**Hd1**), by investigation of the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms in cultivated and wild rice.
   - In rice, OsGI, **Hd1** and Hd3a were identified as orthologs of GI, CO and FT, respectively, and are also important regulators of flowering.
   - **Hd1**, a Major Photoperiod Sensitivity Quantitative Trait Locus in Rice, Is Closely Related to the Arabidopsis Flowering Time Gene CONSTANS.
   - Many other features of the photoperiod genes revealed domestication signatures, which included high linkage disequilibrium (LD) within genes, the occurrence of frequent and recurrent non-functional **Hd1** mutants in cultivated rice, crossovers between subtropical and tropical alleles of **Hd1**, and significant LD between **Hd1** and Hd3a in japonica and indica.
   - Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (**Hd1**, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (E**Hd1**, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome).
   - On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of **Hd1** on FT-like genes and by downregulation of E**Hd1** by the flowering repressor Ghd7 - a unique pathway in rice.
   - We report here that an early heading date 3 (ehd3) mutant flowered later than wild-type plants, particularly under LD conditions, regardless of the **Hd1**-deficient background.
   - Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher E**Hd1** transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of E**Hd1**.
   - In rice, a short-day plant (SDP), the CO ortholog Heading date 1 (**Hd1**) regulates FT ortholog Hd3a, but regulation of Hd3a by **Hd1** differs from that in Arabidopsis.
   - Phytochrome B regulates Heading date 1 (**Hd1**)-mediated expression of rice florigen Hd3a and critical day length in rice.
   - The non-functional **Hd1** alleles found in cultivated rice may be selected during domestication, because they were not found or very rare in wild ancestral rice.
   - We discovered an early heading date2 (ehd2) mutant that shows extremely late flowering under both short- and long-day conditions in line with a background deficient in Heading date1 (**Hd1**), a rice CONSTANS ortholog that belongs to the conserved pathway.
   - The present study was carried out in rice to examine to what extent these three developmental components are modified by the three flowering time genes, Se1 (= **Hd1**), Ef1 and e1 (= m-Ef1), which are known to contribute to flowering time in temperate and tropical regions of rice cultivation.
   - The expression patterns of **Hd1** and Hd3a were also analyzed in different photoperiod and temperature conditions, revealing that **Hd1** mRNA levels displayed similar expression patterns for different photoperiod and temperature treatments, with high expression levels at night and reduced levels in the daytime.
   - In addition, **Hd1** displayed a slightly higher expression level under long-day and low temperature conditions.
   - Since the two genes Se1 (= **Hd1**) and Ef1 (= E**Hd1**) are known to up-regulate the rice homolog of Arabidopsis FT, it is suggested that the detected epistasis may respond to diverse environments by modulating the CO/FT system conserved in flowering plants.
   - We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and E**Hd1**) and negative (**Hd1**, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice.
   - Among these regulators, E**Hd1**, a rice-specific floral inducer, integrates multiple pathways to regulate RFT1, leading to flowering under appropriate photoperiod conditions.
   - 3-kb region covering heading date gene **Hd1** were developed from the indica rice cross Zhenshan97 (ZS97)/Milyang 46 (MY46).
   - E**Hd1** and Hd3a can also be down-regulated by the photoperiodic flowering genes Ghd7 and **Hd1** (a rice ortholog of CONSTANS).
   - To assign the position of Ehd2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such as E**Hd1**, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT-like1 (RFT1; rice florigens), between the wild-type plants and the ehd2 mutants.
   - Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating E**Hd1** and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice.
   - Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating E**Hd1**.
   - First, overexpression of **Hd1** causes a delay in flowering under SD conditions and this effect requires phyB, suggesting that light modulates **Hd1** control of Hd3a transcription.
   - We demonstrate that a histone fold domain scaffold formed by GRAIN YIELD, PLANT HEIGHT AND HEADING DATE 8 (Ghd8) and several NF-YC subunits can accommodate distinct proteins, including **Hd1** and PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 37 (PRR37), and that the resulting OsNF-Y complex containing **Hd1** can bind a specific sequence in the promoter of HEADING DATE 3A (Hd3a).
   - All 12 temperate japonica breeding lines adapted to the tropics possessed the loss-of-function alleles of **Hd1** with no change of other flowering genes compared to common Korean temperate japonica varieties.
   - The lines carrying **Hd1** alone show reduced plant height with fewer primary and secondary branches in panicles.
