## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results indicate that **OsMYB6** gene functions as a stress-responsive transcription factor which plays a positive regulatory role in response to drought and salt stress resistance, and may be used as a candidate gene for molecular breeding of salt-tolerant and drought-tolerant crop varieties.
   - Overexpression of **OsMYB6** in rice did not suggest a negative effect on the growth and development of transgenic plants, but **OsMYB6**-overexpressing plants showed increased tolerance to drought and salt stress compared with wild-type plants, as are evaluated by higher proline content, higher CAT and SOD activities, lower REL and MDA content in transgenic plants under drought and salt stress conditions.
   - In the present study, we cloned and characterized the **OsMYB6** gene, which was induced by drought and salinity stress.
   - In addition, the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes were significantly higher in **OsMYB6** transgenic plants than that in wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions.
   - Subcellular localization of **OsMYB6**-YFP fusion protein in protoplast cells indicated that **OsMYB6** was localized in the nucleus.
