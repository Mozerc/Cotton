## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results show that **OsBRI1** functions in various growth and developmental processes in rice, including (1) internode elongation, by inducing the formation of the intercalary meristem and the longitudinal elongation of internode cells; (2) bending of the lamina joint; and (3) skotomorphogenesis.
   - However, the small grain size of **D61**-7 counters any increase in grain yield, leading to the same grain yield as that of wild type even at high density.
   - The rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant d61 phenotype is caused by loss of function of a rice BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 ortholog, **OsBRI1**.
   - We have identified nine **D61** alleles, the weakest of which, **D61**-7, confers agronomically important traits such as semidwarf stature and erect leaves.
   - The biomass of wild type was 38% higher than that of **D61**-7 at harvest under conventional planting density because of the dwarfism of **D61**-7.
   - We therefore produced transgenic rice with partial suppression of endogenous **OsBRI1** expression to obtain the erect-leaf phenotype without grain changes.
   - Because erect-leaf habit is considered to increase light capture for photosynthesis, we compared the biomass and grain production of wild-type and **D61**-7 rice.
   - We report here the phenotypical and molecular characterization of a rice dwarf mutant, **D61**, that is less sensitive to BR compared to the wild type.
   - Through map-based cloning, Fn189 was found to be a novel allelic mutant of the DWARF 61 (D61) gene, which encodes the putative BRs receptor **OsBRI1**.
   - Taken together, the kinase activity of **OsBRI1** is essential for brassinosteroids to regulate normal plant growth and development in rice.
   - Kinase activity of **OsBRI1** is essential for brassinosteroids to regulate rice growth and development.
   - In contrast to its severe shoot phenotype, the **D61**-4 mutant had a mild root phenotype.
   - The homologous genes for **OsBRI1**, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type.
   - Based on these observations, we conclude that **OsBRI1** is not essential for pattern formation or organ initiation, but is involved in organ development through controlling cell division and elongation.
   - The most severe mutant, **D61**-4, exhibited severe dwarfism and twisted leaves, although pattern formation and differentiation were normal.
   - Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor **OsBRI1**, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene.
   - The grain yield of wild type reached a maximum at middensity, but the yield of **D61**-7 continued to increase with planting density.
   - Since first identifying two alleles of a rice (Oryza sativa) brassinosteroid (BR)-insensitive mutant, d61, that were also defective in an orthologous gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), we have isolated eight additional alleles, including null mutations, of the rice BRI1 gene **OsBRI1**.
   - Mutants defective in the G-protein alpha subunit (d1-1) and brassinosteroid receptor, BRI1 (**D61**-2) also exhibited short seed phenotypes, the former due to impaired cell numbers and the latter due to impaired cell length.
   - Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and **D61**-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or **D61**-2.
   - We cloned a rice gene, **OsBRI1**, with extensive sequence similarity to that of the Arabidopsis BRI gene, which encodes a putative BR receptor kinase.
   - These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through **OsBRI1** and RGA1.
   - In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, **D61**) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1.
   - These results indicate that **D61**-7 produces biomass more effectively than wild type, and consequently more effectively assimilates the biomass in reproductive organ development at high planting density.
   - However, the biomass of **D61**-7 was 35% higher than that of wild type at high planting density.
   - Among the SNDH populations, the analysis of the relative expression level during the panicle formation stage of **OsBRKq1** in panicles of SNDH117, which has the largest grain size, and SNDH6, which has the smallest grain size, the relative expression level was significantly increased in SNDH117 panicles.
   - Grain sizes were diversely distributed in SNDH 113 populations, and **OsBRKq1** was detected on chromosome 1 in an analysis of QTL mapping that used 1000 grain weight, grain length, and grain width.
   - In the future, **OsBRKq1** can be effectively used to increase the yield of rice and solve food problems by increasing the size of seeds.
   - **OsBRKq1** exhibited high sequence similarity with the brassinosteroid leucine-rich repeat-receptor kinases of Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays.
   - Together, our results suggest that OsBSK1-1 may serve as a scaffold protein directly bridging **OsBRI1** and OsGSK2 to positively regulate BR signalling, thus affecting plant architecture and grain size in rice.
   - Moreover, we showed that OsBSK1-1 can be phosphorylated by **OsBRI1** and can inhibit OsGSK2-mediated phosphorylation of BRASSINOSTEROID RESISTANT1 (OsBZR1).
   - Further study showed that hfr131 is a new allele of **OsBRI1** with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (G to A) in the coding region, leading to a T988I conversion at a conserved site of the kinase domain.
   - The identification and characterization of a plant height and grain length related gene **HFR131** in rice.
   - By combining yeast one-hybrid assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR and gene expression quantification, we demonstrated that OsARF17, an auxin response factor, could bind to the promoter region of **HFR131** and positively regulated **HFR131** expression, thereby regulating the plant height and grain length, and influencing brassinosteroid sensitivity.
   - Overall, this study identified hfr131 as a new allele of **OsBRI1** that regulates plant height and grain length in rice, revealed that brassinosteroid and auxin might coordinate through OsARF17-HFR131 interaction, and provided a potential breeding target for improvement of rice yield.
