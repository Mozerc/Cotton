## Functional Descriptions:
   - Notably, **FLO7** peripheral endosperm cells showed obvious defects in compound starch grain development.
   - Together, our findings identify **FLO7** as a unique plant regulator required for starch synthesis and amyloplast development within the peripheral endosperm and provide new insights into the spatial regulation of endosperm development in rice.
   - Map-based cloning of **FLO7** revealed that it encodes a protein of unknown function.
   - Consistent with the phenotypic alternation in **FLO7** endosperm, the **FLO7** mutant had reduced amylose content and seriously disrupted amylopectin structure only in the peripheral endosperm.
   - **FLO7** harbors an N-terminal transit peptide capable of targeting functional **FLO7** fused to green fluorescent protein to amyloplast stroma in developing endosperm cells, and a domain of unknown function 1338 (DUF1338) that is highly conserved in green plants.
   - Furthermore, our combined Î²-glucuronidase activity and RNA in situ hybridization assays showed that the **FLO7** gene was expressed ubiquitously but exhibited a specific expression in the endosperm periphery.
   - Moreover, a set of in vivo experiments demonstrated that the missing 32 aa in the **FLO7** mutant protein are essential for the stable accumulation of **FLO7** in the endosperm.
