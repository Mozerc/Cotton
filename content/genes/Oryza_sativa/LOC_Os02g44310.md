## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **RCc3** improves root system architecture and enhances salt tolerance in rice.
   - In this study, we investigated the biological role of the rice root-specific gene **RCc3** in improving root growth and responses to abiotic stress by overexpressing **RCc3** in rice plants.
   - **RCc3** overexpression produced pleiotropic phenotypes of improved root system architecture, including increased growth of primary root, adventitious roots and lateral roots at the seedling stage.
   - Further study indicated that auxin accumulation in the root was increased through auxin local biosynthesis and polar auxin transport in **RCc3** overexpression lines.
   - Under osmotic and heat stress conditions, the root and shoot growth were less severely inhibited in **RCc3** overexpressing transgenic plants than that in wild-type plants, and the transcript levels of abiotic stress-related genes were significantly increased.
   - Taken together, the data showed that **RCc3** overexpression can improve rice root system, promote plant growth, and enhance plant tolerance to salt stress.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **RCc3** remarkably enhanced the tolerance to salt stress, with the elevated activities of antioxidant enzymes.
   - **RCc3** was induced by osmotic and heat stress.
