## Functional Descriptions:
   - The shoot organization2 (**SHO2**) mutant, a weak allele of SHOOTLESS4 that is a ZIPPY/ARGONAUTE7 homolog in rice, shows a variety of leaf abnormalities; filamentous leaves, bi- or trifurcated leaves, separation of the filamentous structure from the leaf blade or deletion of the margin.
   - The expression pattern of **SHO2** in the outer layer of the shoot apical meristem and the adaxial surface of the leaf, as well as the altered expression of HD-ZIP III and ETTIN homologs in the central domain of **SHO2** leaves, suggest that normal development of the central domain is a prerequisite for the synchronous growth of the three domains.
   - The mechanism regulating the pattern of leaf initiation was analyzed by using shoot organization (sho) mutants derived from three loci (SHO1, **SHO2**, and SHO3).
   - Rice SHL2, **shl4**/SHO2, and SHO1 encoded orthologues of Arabidopsis RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, ARGONAUTE (AGO) 7, and DICER-like 4, respectively, whose mutations affect leaf development through the trans-acting siRNA (ta-siRNA) pathway.
   - The gain-of-function experiment by the ectopic expression of **shl4** resulted in reduced accumulation of an microRNA, miR166, and partial adaxialization of leaves, supporting a role for the ta-siRNA pathway in the maintenance of leaf polarity as previously reported in maize.
   - The leaf founder cells for the lateral and marginal domains are recruited normally in **SHO2**, indicating that **SHO2** is defective in the growth of leaf domains after the founder cells are recruited.
   - Mutations in rice SHOOTLESS2 (SHL2), **shl4**/SHOOT ORGANIZATION2 (SHO2), and SHO1 cause complete deletion or abnormal formation of the SAM.
   - According to high-sequence conservation, the rolled-leaf gene in rice could be orthologous to the Arabidopsis ZIP/Ago7 gene, so we called it **OsAGO7**.
   - Over-expression of rice **OsAGO7** gene induces upward curling of the leaf blade that enhanced erect-leaf habit.
   - A miR390 mutant also exhibits female sterility, suggesting that female fertility is controlled by the miR390-AGO7 module..
