## Functional Descriptions:
   - ), we screened T-DNA mutants and identified a drought- and salt-hypersensitive mutant **DSM3**.
   - Interestingly, overexpression of DSM3 (**OsITPK2**) in rice resulted in drought- and salt-hypersensitive phenotypes and physiological changes similar to those in the mutant.
   - The expression level of **DSM3** promoter-driven beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in rice was induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid.
   - These results together suggest that DSM3/**OsITPK2** is an important member of the OsITPK family for stress responses, and an optimal expression level is essential for drought and salt tolerance in rice.
   - Transcript level analysis of OsITPK genes revealed that they had different tempo-spatial expression patterns, and the responses of **DSM3** to abiotic stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, and high temperature, were distinct from the other five members in rice.
