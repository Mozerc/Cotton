## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g64310](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g64310)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0862800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0862800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ENAC1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Comparative time-course expression analysis indicated that **ENAC1** expression, similar with OsDREB1A, was induced very quickly by various abiotic stresses including salt, drought, cold, and exogenous abscisic acid.
   - The promoter sequence of **ENAC1** harbors several cis-elements including ABA response elements, but the well-known dehydration responsive element/C-repeat element is absent.
   - In this research, a full-length cDNA named **ENAC1** (early NAC-domain protein induced by abiotic stress 1) was isolated from rice.
   - However, the induction of **ENAC1** by abiotic stress was transient and lasted up to 3 h, whereas that of OsDREB1A maintained longer.
   - Taken together, **ENAC1** may be an early transcription activator of stress responses and function in the regulation of NACRS-mediated gene expression under abiotic stress.
   - **ENAC1**, a NAC transcription factor, is an early and transient response regulator induced by abiotic stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
