## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice gene Oryza sativa Drought Stress Response-1 (**OsDSR-1**) was one of the genes identified to be responsive to drought stress in the panicle of rice at booting and heading stages by both microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses.
   - Further analysis showed that external Ca2+ was required for the production of larger root systems, indicating that the promotion by **OsDSR-1** of the LR development of transgenic Arabidopsis seemed to occur in a Ca2+-dependent manner under high-potassium conditions.
   - We propose that **OsDSR-1** may function as a calcium sensor of the signal transduction pathway controlling the LR development under high-potassium conditions.
   - Rice Gene **OsDSR-1** Promotes Lateral Root Development in Arabidopsis Under High-Potassium Conditions.
   - **OsDSR-1** encodes a putative calcium-binding protein, and its overexpression in Arabidopsis rendered transgenic plants to produce much shorter lateral roots (LRs) than wild-type (WT) plants in the medium supplemented with abscisic acid (ABA), suggesting that **OsDSR-1** may act as a positive regulator during the process of ABA inhibition of LR development.
