## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g15700](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g15700)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0256200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0256200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsHARP
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice plants transformed with the **OsHARP** promoter-GUS construct showed GUS staining in the basal parts of leaf sheaths, and although GUS activity increased when treated with GA(3), it was not as high an increase as when mRNA was analyzed.
   - To elucidate the role of **OsHARP** in leaf sheath elongation, antisense **OsHARP** transgenic rice lines were constructed.
   - To examine whether **OsHARP** expression would affect other proteins, basal leaf sheaths from antisense **OsHARP** transgenic rice plants were analyzed using proteomic techniques.
   - The mRNA expression level of **OsHARP** was up-regulated in rice seedlings treated with gibberellin (GA), but not ABA and showed a similar pattern as OsCRT mRNA.
   - In antisense transgenic-rice **OsHARP** plants, OsCRT was down-regulated and the levels of 20 other proteins were changed compared to the pattern of the vector control.
