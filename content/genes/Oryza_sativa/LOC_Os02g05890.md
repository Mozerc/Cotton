## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g05890](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g05890)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0152900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0152900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** YL1;YS83
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A Nucleus-Encoded Chloroplast Protein **YL1** Is Involved in Chloroplast Development and Efficient Biogenesis of Chloroplast ATP Synthase in Rice.
   - The **YL1** mutation showed reduced chlorophyll contents, abnormal chloroplast morphology, and decreased photochemical efficiency.
   - Moreover, **YL1** deficiency disrupts the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis.
   - Map-based cloning and characterization of the novel yellow-green leaf gene **YS83** in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Taken together, we successfully identified a novel yellow-green leaf gene **YS83**.
   - Gene **YS83** was expressed in a wide range of tissues, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast.
   - 6%, respectively, meanwhile its seed setting rate and 1000-grain weight (seed size) were not significantly affected in the mutant, so leaf-color mutant gene **YS83** could be used as a trait marker gene in commercial hybrid rice production.
   - Map-based cloning and sequencing analysis suggested that the candidate gene was **YS83** (LOC_Os02g05890) encoding a protein containing 165 amino acid residues.
