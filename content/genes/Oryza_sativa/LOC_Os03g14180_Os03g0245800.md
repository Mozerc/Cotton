- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0245800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0245800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** Oshsp26
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **Oshsp26** gene was expressed following heat stress: the transcript level was highest when rice leaves were treated at high temperatures for 2h at 42 degrees C, and the transcripts became detectable after 20min and reached a maximum level after 2h.
   - Nakdong) cDNA clone, **Oshsp26**, encoding the chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein (smHSP) was isolated.
   - Since MV treatment in the light leads to the generation of H(2)O(2) inside the chloroplast, it is likely that H(2)O(2) by itself acts to induce the expression of the **Oshsp26** gene.
   - We previously isolated and characterized a rice cDNA clone, **Oshsp26**, encoding a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein that is expressed following oxidative or heat stress.
   - Overexpression of a chloroplast-localized small heat shock protein **Oshsp26** confers enhanced tolerance against oxidative and heat stresses in tall fescue.
   - It was also found that the **Oshsp26** gene was expressed following oxidative stress even in the absence of heat stress.
   - These results suggest that the **Oshsp26** protein plays an important role in the protection of PSII during heat and oxidative stress in vivo.
