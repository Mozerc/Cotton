## Functional Descriptions:
   - The rice U-box/ARM E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11 negatively regulates programmed cell death (PCD) and disease resistance, and controls flowering time through interacting with the novel RNA/DNA binding KH domain protein **SPIN1**.
   - **SPIN1** overexpression causes late flowering independently of daylength; expression analyses of flowering marker genes in these lines suggested that **SPIN1** represses flowering by downregulating the flowering promoter gene Heading date3a (Hd3a) via Hd1-dependent mechanisms in short days and by targeting Hd1-independent factors in long days.
   - **SPIN1**, a K homology domain protein negatively regulated and ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPL11, is involved in flowering time control in rice.
   - Overexpression of **SPIN1** causes late flowering in transgenic rice under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions.
   - In this study, we characterized the function of the RNA-binding and **SPIN1**-interacting 1 (RBS1) protein in flowering time regulation.
   - These results suggest that RBS1 is a new negative regulator of flowering time that itself is positively regulated by **SPIN1** but negatively regulated by SPL11 in rice.
   - RBS1, an RNA Binding Protein, Interacts with **SPIN1** and Is Involved in Flowering Time Control in Rice.
   - We demonstrate here that SPL11 also regulates flowering via interaction with **SPIN1** (for SPL11-interacting protein1), a Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA family member.
   - Moreover, we show that coincidence of high accumulation of **SPIN1** mRNA with the light in the morning and early evening is needed to repress flowering.
   - Our data are consistent with a model in which **SPIN1** acts as a negative regulator of flowering that itself is negatively regulated by SPL11, possibly via ubiquitination.
