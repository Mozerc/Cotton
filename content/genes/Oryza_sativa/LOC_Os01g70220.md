- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Loss-of-function mutants of **SDG714** (**SDG714**IR transformants) generated by RNA interference display a mostly glabrous phenotype as a result of the lack of macro trichomes in glumes, leaves, and culms compared with control plants.
   - Overexpression of YFP-**SDG714** in Arabidopsis significantly inhibits plant growth and this inhibition is associated with an enhanced level of H3K9 dimethylation.
   - Our microarray results show that many genes essential for the plant growth and development were downregulated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing YFP-**SDG714**.
   - Most interestingly, when YFP-**SDG714** production is stopped, the inhibited plants can partially restore their growth, suggesting that the perturbation of gene expression caused by YFP-**SDG714** is revertible.
   - Taken together, our results point to an important role of **SDG714** in H3K9 dimethylation, suppression of gene expression and plant growth, and provide a potential method to regulate gene expression and plant development by an on-off switch of **SDG714** expression.
   - **SDG714** regulates specific gene expression and consequently affects plant growth via H3K9 dimethylation.
