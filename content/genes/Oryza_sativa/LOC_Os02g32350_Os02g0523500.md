## Functional Descriptions:
   - Consistent with this view, GFP-tagged **OsTudor-SN** is observed in living endosperm sections as moving particles, a property inhibited by microfilament inhibitors.
   - These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of **OsTudor-SN** confer different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
   - Normal protein body formation, grain weight, and expression of many genes were partially restored in EM1084 transgenic line complemented with wildtype **OsTudor-SN** gene.
   - Overall, our study showed that **OsTudor-SN** possesses multiple functional properties in rice storage protein expression and seed development and that the 4SN and Tsn modules have unique roles in these processes.
   - The Role of RNA Binding Protein **OsTudor-SN** in Post-Transcriptional Regulation of Seed Storage Proteins and Endosperm Development..
   - Transcriptome analysis indicates that **OsTudor-SN** also functions in regulating gene expression of transcriptional factors and genes involved in developmental processes and stress responses as well as for storage proteins.
   - We had previously demonstrated that **OsTudor-SN** is a key player for transporting storage protein mRNAs to speciÔ¨Åc ER subdomains in developing rice endosperm.
