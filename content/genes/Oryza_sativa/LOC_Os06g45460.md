## Functional Descriptions:
   - Vegetative development is also affected in the **APO1**.
   - Leaves were formed rapidly throughout the vegetative phase, indicating that **APO1** is also involved in temporal regulation of leaf production.
   - These phenotypes suggest that the **APO1** plays an important role in the temporal regulation of both vegetative and reproductive development.
   - We previously reported that the ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (**APO1**) gene, encoding an F-box-containing protein orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, suppresses precocious conversion of rachis branch meristems to spikelets to ensure generation of certain number of spikelets.
   - Positional cloning of the gene revealed that SCM2 was identical to ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (**APO1**), a gene previously reported to control panicle structure.
   - Although SCM2 is a gain-of-function mutant of **APO1**, it does not have the negative effects reported for **APO1** overexpression mutants, such as decreased panicle number and abnormal spikelet morphology.
   - In addition, **APO1** is associated with the regulation of the plastchron, floral organ identity, and floral determinacy.
   - Phenotypic analyses of **APO1** and floral homeotic double mutants demonstrate that **APO1** positively regulates class-C floral homeotic genes, but not class-B genes.
   - Molecular studies revealed that **APO1** encodes an F-box protein, an ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGAN (UFO), which is a positive regulator of class-B genes.
   - Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and **APO1**, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development.
   - ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with **APO1**.
   - This alteration in growth rate is opposite to what is observed with the **APO1** mutants that have a smaller inflorescence meristem.
   - However, in **APO1**, the main-axis meristem was converted to a spikelet meristem after producing a small number of branch primordia.
   - In addition, the branch meristems in **APO1** became spikelet meristems earlier than in wild type.
   - Therefore, in the inflorescence, the **APO1** mutation caused the precocious conversion of the meristem identity.
   - In the **APO1** flower, lodicules were increased at the expense of stamens, and carpels were formed indeterminately by the loss of meristem determinacy.
   - Characterization of rice aberrant panicle organization 1 (**APO1**) mutants revealed that **APO1** positively controls spikelet number by suppressing the precocious conversion of inflorescence meristems to spikelet meristems.
   - We report a recessive mutation of rice, aberrant panicle organization 1 (**APO1**), which severely affects inflorescence architecture, floral organ identity, and leaf production rate.
   - In the **APO1**-D dominant alleles, the inflorescence meristem starts to increase in size more vigorously than the wild type when switching to the reproductive development phase.
   - **APO1** expression occurred not only in developing panicles but also in the developing vascular bundle systems.
   - It suggests that **APO1** enhances the formation of vascular bundle systems which, consequently, promote carbohydrate translocation to panicles.
   - The HI1 allele is suggested to regulate the amount of **APO1** expression, and thereby control the development of vascular bundle systems.
   - In this study, using chromosome segment substitution lines, we identified an effective quantitative trait loci (QTL) for culm strength, which was designated STRONG CULM2 (**SCM2**).
   - A near-isogenic line carrying **SCM2** showed enhanced culm strength and increased spikelet number because of the pleiotropic effects of the gene.
   - Collectively, these results suggest that the level of **APO1** activity regulates the inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem.
   - As the mutant inflorescences and flowers differed considerably between **APO1** and ufo, the functions of **APO1** and UFO appear to have diverged during evolution.
   - Habataki-genotype segregated reciprocal recombinant lines for the **APO1** locus increased both the number of PRB (12-13%) and the number of grains per panicle (9-12%), which increased the grain yield per plant (5-7%).
   - The PRB1 allele, which includes the **APO1** open reading frame (ORF) and the proximal promoter region, controlled only the number of PRB but not the number of grains per panicle.
   - Here, we identified four dominant mutants producing an increased number of spikelets and found that they are gain-of-function alleles of **APO1**.
   - The **APO1** expression levels are elevated in all four mutants, suggesting that an increase of **APO1** activity caused the delay in the program shift to spikelet formation.
   - The resultant gene was ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 (**APO1**).
   - Overexpression of **APO1** caused an increase in inflorescence branches and spikelets.
   - These data indicate that ozone-induced grain yield loss in Habataki is caused by a reduction in the **APO1** transcript level through an increase in the levels of phytohormones that reduce leaf damage.
   - The Habataki allele of the **APO1** locus in a near-isogenic line also resulted in grain yield loss upon ozone exposure, suggesting **APO1** involvement in ozone-induced yield loss.
   - Genetic analyses support that LARGE2 functions with **APO1** and APO2 in a common pathway to regulate panicle size and grain number.
