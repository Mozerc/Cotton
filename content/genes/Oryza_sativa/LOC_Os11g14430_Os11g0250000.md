## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os11g14430](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os11g14430)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os11g0250000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os11g0250000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** RBS1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we characterized the function of the RNA-binding and SPIN1-interacting 1 (**RBS1**) protein in flowering time regulation.
   - These results suggest that **RBS1** is a new negative regulator of flowering time that itself is positively regulated by SPIN1 but negatively regulated by SPL11 in rice.
   - **RBS1**, an RNA Binding Protein, Interacts with SPIN1 and Is Involved in Flowering Time Control in Rice.
   - **RBS1** overexpression causes delayed flowering under SD and LD conditions in rice.
   - Expression analyses of flowering marker genes show that **RBS1** overexpression represses the expression of Hd3a under SD and LD conditions.
