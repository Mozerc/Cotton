## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overall, our data demonstrate the significant roles of **RBP-P** in glutelin and prolamine mRNA localization and in the regulation of genes important for plant growth and development through its RNA binding activity and cooperative regulation with interacting proteins.
   - In addition, partial loss of **RBP-P** function conferred a broad phenotypic variation ranging from dwarfism, chlorophyll deficiency and sterility to late flowering and low spikelet fertility.
   - Transcriptome analysis highlighted the essential role of **RBP-P** in regulating storage protein genes and several essential biological processes during grain development.
   - RNA-binding protein **RBP-P** is required for glutelin and prolamine mRNA localization in rice endosperm cells..
   - Different mutant **RBP-P** proteins exhibited varying degrees of reduced RNA binding and/or protein-protein interaction properties, which may account for the mis-localization of storage protein RNAs.
   - RNA-binding protein **RBP-P** binds to both glutelin and prolamine mRNAs, suggesting a role in some aspect of their RNA metabolism.
   - Here, we show that rice lines expressing mutant **RBP-P** mis-localize both glutelin and prolamine mRNAs.
