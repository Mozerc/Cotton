## Functional Descriptions:
   - Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes and yeast demonstrated that **OsPIN9** is a functional auxin efflux transporter.
   - Compared with wild-type plants, **OsPIN9** mutants had fewer tillers, and **OsPIN9** overexpression increased the tiller number.
   - Additionally, **OsPIN9** was mainly expressed in vascular tissue of the junction and tiller buds, and encoded a membrane-localised protein.
   - Cadmium rapidly downregulated the expression of the auxin efflux transporter genes OsPIN1b, OsPIN1c and **OsPIN9** in the stele and LPR.
   - The results showed that **OsPIN9** expression was dramatically and rapidly suppressed by chilling stress (4Â°C) in rice seedlings.
   - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation in auxin efflux carrier **OsPIN9** confers chilling tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species homeostasis in rice.
   - **OsPIN9** mutant roots and shoots were less sensitive to 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), indicating the disturbance of auxin homeostasis in the **OsPIN9** mutants.
   - The chilling tolerance assay showed that **OsPIN9** mutants were more tolerant to chilling stress than wild-type (WT) plants, as evidenced by increased survival rate, decreased membrane permeability, and reduced lipid peroxidation.
   - However, the expression of well-known C-REPEAT BINDING FACTOR (CBF)/DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (DREB)-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathway and Ca(2+) signaling genes was significantly induced only under normal conditions, implying that defense responses in **OsPIN9** mutants have probably been triggered in advance under normal conditions.
   - Consistently, antioxidant enzyme activity, including catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), improved significantly during the early chilling treatments, while was kept similar to WT at the later stage of chilling treatment, implying that the enhanced chilling tolerance of **OsPIN9** mutants is mainly attributed to the earlier induction of ROS and the improved ROS scavenging ability at the subsequent stages of chilling treatment.
   - In summary, our results strongly suggest that the **OsPIN9** gene regulates chilling tolerance by modulating ROS homeostasis in rice.
   - Histochemical staining of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 3&#x27;3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) showed that **OsPIN9** mutants accumulated more ROS than WT at the early stage of chilling stress, while less ROS was observed at the later stage of chilling treatment in **OsPIN9** mutants.
