## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice shaker potassium channel **OsKAT1** confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells.
   - By the expression of **OsKAT1**, the K(+) contents of salt-stressed G19 cells increased during the exponential growth phase.
   - These results suggest that **OsKAT1** is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K(+) channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na(+).
   - We found that expression of a cDNA clone, encoding the rice homolog of Shaker family K(+) channel KAT1 (**OsKAT1**), suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of yeast strain G19 (Deltaena1-4), which lacks a major component of Na(+) efflux.
   - Rice cells overexpressing **OsKAT1** also showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased cellular K(+) content.
   - These functions of **OsKAT1** are likely to be common among Shaker K(+) channels because OsAKT1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) KAT1 were able to complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of G19 as well as **OsKAT1**.
   - In addition, the real-time PCR results revealed that OsAKTs and OsKATs are induced by salt stress in root and shoot tissues of rice cultivars, and **OsKAT1** was identified as a key gene involved in the rice response to salt stress.
