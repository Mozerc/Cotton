## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os06g02144](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g02144)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0111500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0111500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** Os6PGDH,Os6PGDH1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - RT-PCR experiments revealed that **Os6PGDH** expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves.
   - Furthermore, **Os6PGDH** was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress.
   - Levels of **Os6PGDH1** transcripts were detected in all five examined tissues, with the highest in outer leaf sheaths and lowest in inner leaf sheaths.
   - Taken together, these results indicate that **Os6PGDH1** plays a pivotal role not only in rice growth but also in the resistance of rice to BPH by modulating JA, ethylene, and H2O2 pathways.
   - In addition, the overexpression of **Os6PGDH1** enhanced levels of BPH-induced JA, jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile), and H2O2, but decreased BPH-induced levels of ethylene.
   - **Os6PGDH1** expression was strongly induced by mechanical wounding, infestation of gravid BPH females, and jasmonic acid (JA) treatment.
   - Overexpressing **Os6PGDH1** (oe6PGDH) decreased the height of rice plants and the mass of the aboveground part of plants, but slightly increased the length of plant roots.
