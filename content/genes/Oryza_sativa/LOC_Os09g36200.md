## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SGR**, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves.
   - Senescence-induced expression of **SGR** and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin.
   - This indicates that upregulation of **SGR** increases Chl breakdown during senescence in rice.
   - A small quantity of chlorophyllide a accumulated in **SGR** leaves, but this also accumulated in wild-type rice leaves during senescence.
   - In this study, we found that overexpression of **SGR** (Ov-**SGR**) resulted in the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and produced a chlorophyll-dependent regional cell death phenotype on leaves of rice seedlings.
   - Transcriptome analyses using Affymetrix Rice GeneChips revealed that Ov-**SGR** rice seedlings exhibited a number of signs of singlet oxygen response.
   - Overexpression of **SGR** results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings.
   - The Stay-Green Rice (**SGR**) protein is encoded by the **SGR** gene and has been shown to affect chlorophyll (Chl) degradation during natural and dark-induced leaf senescence.
   - We show that **SGR**L is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence.
   - Overexpression of **SGR**L reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice.
   - The gene, designated Stay Green Rice (**SGR**), was cloned by a positional cloning strategy encoding an ancient protein containing a putative chloroplast transit peptide.
   - It is thought that the Stay Green Rice (**SGR**) gene is involved in the disaggregation of the light harvesting complex and in the subsequent breakdown of chlorophyll and apo-protein during senescence.
   - Promoter variations in the Stay-Green (**OsSGR**) gene encoding the chlorophyll-degrading Mg++-dechelatase were found to trigger higher and earlier induction of **OsSGR** in indica, which accelerated senescence of indica rice cultivars.
   - Japonica **OsSGR** alleles introgressed into indica-type cultivars in Korean rice fields lead to delayed senescence, with increased grain yield and enhanced photosynthetic competence.
   - Taken together, these data establish that naturally occurring **OsSGR** promoter and related lifespan variations can be exploited in breeding programs to augment rice yield.
