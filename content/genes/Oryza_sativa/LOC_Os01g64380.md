## Functional Descriptions:
   - Electron microscope observations indicated that the leaf incurvations of **REL1** dominant mutants result from the alteration of the size and number of bulliform cells.
   - Alternatively, overexpression of **REL1** in wild-type plants induced a phenotype similar to that of the dominant **REL1** mutant, indicating that **REL1** plays a positive role in leaf rolling and bending.
   - Taken together, these findings suggest that **REL1** regulates leaf morphology, particularly in leaf rolling and bending, through the coordination of BR signalling transduction.
   - Consistent with the observed **REL1** phenotype, the **REL1** gene was predominantly expressed in the meristem of various tissues during plant growth and development.
   - Nevertheless, the responsiveness of both **REL1** dominant mutants and **REL1**-overexpressing plants to exogenous brassinosteroid (BR) was reduced.
   - Moreover, transcript levels of BR response genes in the **REL1** dominant mutants and **REL1**-overexpressing lines were significantly altered.
   - Constitutive expression of **REL1** confers the rice response to drought stress and abscisic acid.
   - However, the role of **REL1** in drought response is still poorly understood.
   - Moreover, our results revealed that **REL1**-D was hypersensitive to ABA and the expression of ABA associated genes was significantly increased in **REL1**-D, suggesting that **REL1** likely coordinates ABA to regulate drought response.
   - Consistently, we also found that constitutive expression of **REL1** alters the expression of biotic and abiotic stress responsive genes by the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis.
