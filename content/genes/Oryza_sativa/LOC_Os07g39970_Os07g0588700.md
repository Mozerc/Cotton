## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overproduction of **ZFP245** enhanced the activities of reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes under stress conditions and increased the tolerance of rice seedlings to oxidative stress.
   - However, **ZFP245** was not regulated by high salt or abscisic acid treatment.
   - The semi-quantitative-RT-PCR assay revealed **ZFP245** was strongly induced after 6 h exposure to cold and drought stresses, and then reduced to the baseline.
   - Taken together, **ZFP245**, as the first identified C2H2-type zinc finger protein involved in stress response in monocots probably plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant cold and drought responses through an ABA-independent pathway.
   - A C2H2-type zinc finger protein gene **ZFP245** was cloned by RT-PCR approach from cold treated rice seedlings.
   - Our data suggest that **ZFP245** may contribute to the tolerance of rice plants to cold and drought stresses by regulating proline levels and reactive oxygen species-scavenging activities, and therefore may be useful for developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress.
   - **ZFP245** is a cold- and drought-responsive gene that encodes a zinc finger protein in rice.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing **ZFP245** were generated and found to display high tolerance to cold and drought stresses.
   - Increased tolerance of rice to cold, drought and oxidative stresses mediated by the overexpression of a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein **ZFP245**.
   - Tissue expression analysis showed that **ZFP245** was constitutively expressed in various rice tissues including roots, stems, leaves and spikes.
