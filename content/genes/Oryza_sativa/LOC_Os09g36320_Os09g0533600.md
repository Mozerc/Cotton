## Functional Descriptions:
   - Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation of **BSR1** was critical for proper localization of **BSR1** in rice cells and played a crucial role in **BSR1**-mediated resistance to multiple diseases, as evidenced by compromised disease resistance in transgenic plants overexpressing a mutant **BSR1** in which Tyr-63 was substituted with Ala.
   - Overall, our data indicate that **BSR1** is a nonreceptor dual-specificity kinase and that both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase activities are critical for the normal functioning of **BSR1** in the resistance to multiple pathogens.
   - In the present study, we report that **BSR1** is a functional protein kinase that autophosphorylates and transphosphorylates an artificial substrate, in vitro.
   - Although **BSR1** is classified as a serine/threonine kinase, it was shown to autophosphorylate on tyrosine as well as on serine/threonine residues when expressed in bacteria, demonstrating that it is a dual-specificity kinase.
   - Here we analyzed immune responses using rice suspension-cultured cells and sliced leaf blades overexpressing **BSR1**.
   - **BSR1** overexpression enhances MAMP-triggered production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and transcriptional activation of the defense-related gene in cultured cells and leaf strips.
   - Broad-Spectrum Disease Resistance Conferred by the Overexpression of Rice RLCK **BSR1** Results from an Enhanced Immune Response to Multiple MAMPs..
   - Furthermore, the co-cultivation of leaves with conidia of the blast fungus revealed that **BSR1** overexpression allowed host plants to produce detectable oxidative bursts against compatible pathogens.
   - However, it remains unclear how overexpressed **BSR1** reinforces plant immunity.
   - **BSR1** was also involved in the immune responses triggered by peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide.
   - Overexpression of **BSR1** confers strong resistance against fungal and bacterial pathogens.
   - In the background of **BSR1** overaccumulation, the knockout of OsCERK1 nearly abolished the enhancement of blast resistance.
   - Our recent study revealed that MAMP-triggered immune responses are mediated by **BSR1** in wild-type rice and are hyperactivated in **BSR1**-overexpressing rice.
