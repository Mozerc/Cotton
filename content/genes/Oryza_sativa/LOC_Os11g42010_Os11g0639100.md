## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **pi54** gene (Pi-k(h)) confers a high degree of resistance to diverse strains of the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - Detection of callose deposition in resistant plants containing Pi-k h (**pi54**) gene implicates its involvement in the initiation of defense response cascade.
   - In our effort to identify more effective forms of this gene, we isolated an orthologue of **pi54** named as **pi54**rh from the blast-resistant wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis, using allele mining approach and validated by complementation.
   - The blast resistance candidate gene Pi-k h (**pi54**) was cloned into a plant transformation vector and the construct was used to transform a japonica cultivar of rice Taipei 309, which is susceptible to M.
   - Functional complementation of rice blast resistance gene Pi-k h (**pi54**) conferring resistance to diverse strains of Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - The single functional blast resistance gene **pi54** activates a complex defence mechanism in rice.
   - The dominant rice blast resistance gene, **pi54** confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae in different parts of India.
   - A novel blast resistance gene, **pi54**rh cloned from wild species of rice, Oryza rhizomatis confers broad spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated that a rice blast resistance gene **pi54**rh cloned from wild species of rice provides broad spectrum resistance to M.
   - The **pi54**rh belongs to CC-NBS-LRR family of disease resistance genes with a unique Zinc finger (C(3)H type) domain.
   - This study suggests the activation of defence response and transcription factor-related genes and a higher expression of key enzymes involved in the defence response pathway in the rice line TP-**pi54**, thus leading to incompatible host-pathogen interaction.
   - The transgenic lines containing **pi54** gene have higher tiller number, grain weight, epicotyl length, and yield compared to the non-transgenic control.
   - Phenotypic expression of blast resistance gene **pi54** is not affected by its chromosomal position..
   - This is a novel report in which chromosomal position of the rice blast resistance gene **pi54** was not found to affect significantly the resistance phenotype or morphological traits.
   - Three different transgenic lines containing **pi54** and its orthologue **pi54**rh were shown to be resistant to different races of M.
   - These results will facilitate precise utilization of **pi54** gene and its orthologue in breeding programs for the development of rice cultivars with broad spectrum and durable resistance to M.
   - **pi54** gene imparts resistance against M.
   - Extensive sequence variation in rice blast resistance gene **pi54** makes it broad spectrum in nature..
   - This is a maiden report of extensive variability of **pi54** alleles in different landraces and cultivated varieties, possibly, attributing broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - Rice blast resistant gene, **pi54** cloned from rice line, Tetep, is effective against diverse isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - High quality sequences were generated for homologs of **pi54** gene.
   - The rice blast resistance gene **pi54** initially identified in an Indian cultivar confers broad-spectrum resistance in India.
   - Together, the newly identified **pi54** alleles expand the allelic series and are candidates for rice blast resistance breeding programs.
   - We explored the allelic diversity of the **pi54** gene among 885 Indian rice genotypes that were found resistant in our screening against field mixture of naturally existing M.
   - The objective of this study was to determine the effects (through over-expressing and using the CaMV 35S promoter) of **pikh** on MR219 resistance because it is a rice variety that is susceptible to the blast fungus pathotype P7.
   - This study successfully clarified that over-expression of the **pikh** gene in transgenic plants can improve their blast resistance against the M.
   - Over-Expression of the **pikh** Gene with a CaMV 35S Promoter Leads to Improved Blast Disease (Magnaporthe oryzae) Tolerance in Rice..
   - brachyantha was on the root of both **pi54** and #11 alleles.
   - Divergent evolution of rice blast resistance **pi54** locus in the genus Oryza..
   - The rice blast resistance gene **pi54** was cloned from Oryza sativa ssp.
   - Two divergent structures of **pi54** locus caused by a mobile unit containing the nearby R-gene cluster could be developed before domestication.
   - In BC3F3 generation, the improved pyramided lines carrying a total of seven genes/QTLs (xa5 + xa13 + Xa21 + **pi54** + qSBR7-1 + qSBR11-1 + qSBR11-2) were selected through molecular and phenotypic assay, and these were evaluated for resistance against bacterial blight, blast, and sheath blight pathogens under greenhouse conditions.
