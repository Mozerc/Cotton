## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os11g26160](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os11g26160)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os11g0448400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os11g0448400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsSIG2A</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Gene expression analysis revealed that the **OsSIG2A** transcript is more abundant than the OsSIG2B transcript in all tissues tested and that both rice SIG2s are expressed from earlier stages of leaf development than that in the case of OsSIG1.
   - Differential Expression of Three Plastidial Sigma Factors,OsSIG1,**OsSIG2A**, andOsSIG2B, during Leaf Development in Rice.
   - Accumulation of transcripts of nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes, such as cab and rbcS, was strongly suppressed in the mutant at later stages of chloroplast differentiation, whereas transcripts of genes for the plastid transcription apparatus, such as OsRpoTp and **OsSIG2A**, accumulated to abnormally high levels at these stages.
   - **OsSIG2A** is required for chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa L.) at low temperature by regulating plastid genes expression.
   - Here, we uncovered the essential role of **OsSIG2A** in rice chloroplast development at low temperatures by a newly reported thermo-sensitive chlorophyll deficient 12 (tcd12) mutant, which exhibited albino leaves with decreased chlorophyll content and malformed chloroplasts at seedling stage under low temperature.
   - Taken together, our findings indicate that **OsSIG2A** is required for early chloroplast differentiation under low temperatures by regulating plastid genes expression.
