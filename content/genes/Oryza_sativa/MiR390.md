## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** MiR390
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - MiR393 and **MiR390** synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.
   - Here we show that **MiR390** induced by auxin promotes lateral root growth in rice.
   - **MiR390** was found to be dominantly expressed at lateral root primordia and roots tips while miR393 mainly expressed in the base part of roots at very low level.
   - We propose that **MiR390** induced by auxin triggers the lateral root growth under normal growth conditions, meanwhile miR393 just lurks as a potentially regulative role; Once plants suffer from stresses, miR393 will be induced to negatively regulate **MiR390**-mediated growth of lateral roots in rice.
   - However, the risen expression level of **MiR390** induced by auxin didn't affect the expression of miR393 and its target OsTIR1 (Transport Inhibitor Response 1).
