- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and **OsAFB2** to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering.
   - OsTIR1 and **OsAFB2** downregulation via OsmiR393 overexpression leads to more tillers, early flowering and less tolerance to salt and drought in rice.
   - Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and **OsAFB2** interact with OsIAA1.
   - In this study, we verified that two rice auxin receptor gene homologs (OsTIR1 and **OsAFB2**) could be targeted by OsmiR393 (Os for Oryza sativa).
   - These data indicated that the phenotypes of OsmiR393-overexpressing rice may be caused through hyposensitivity to the auxin signal by reduced expression of two auxin receptor genes (OsTIR1 and **OsAFB2**).
   - * This study functionally characterizes two members of the rice (Oryza sativa) miR393 family and their target genes, OsTIR1 and **OsAFB2** (AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX), the two closest homologs of Arabidopsis TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1).
