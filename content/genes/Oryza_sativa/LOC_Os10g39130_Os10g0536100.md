- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0536100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0536100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsMADS56,GL10
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OsMADS56** (56OX) also resulted in delayed flowering under LD.
   - These observations imply that OsMADS50 and **OsMADS56** function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering.
   - OsMADS50 and **OsMADS56** function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice.
   - 8, **OsMADS56** encoding a MADS-box transcription factor, was performed in this study.
   - In these populations, decreased grain weight and size were associated with a reduction in the expression of **OsMADS56**.
   - In transgenic populations of **OsMADS56** driven by a strong constitutive promoter, grain weight and size of the positive plants were significantly higher than those of the negative plants.
   - Cloning of **OsMADS56** provides a new gene resource to improve grain weight and size through molecular design breeding.
   - Control of Thousand-Grain Weight by **OsMADS56** in Rice..
   - **GL10** regulates grain length by promoting greater longitudinal cell growth in the grain glume.
   - 0-kb deletion in the first exon that abolishes its transcription, results in shorter grain length, lower grain weight and delayed flowering in **GL10** plants.
   - The knockout of **GL10** in the HJX74 background leads to grain phenotypes similar to that of NIL-**GL10**, while overexpression of **GL10** results in increased grain length and weight and earlier heading date.
   - Our findings reveal an allelic variation of **GL10** that may explain differences in grain length among modern cultivars and could be used to breed rice varieties with optimized grain shape.
   - Additionally, **GL10** participates in the regulation of gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathway genes in young panicle tissues.
