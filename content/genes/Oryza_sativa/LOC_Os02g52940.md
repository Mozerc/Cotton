## Functional Descriptions:
   - qPCR reveals that the **OsPPa6** gene was significantly induced by AS, and the mutagenesis of the **OsPPa6** gene apparently delayed rice's growth and development, especially under AS.
   - Measurements demonstrate that the contents of pyrophosphate in the mutants were higher than those in the wild type under AS, however, the accumulation of inorganic phosphate, ATP, chlorophyll, sucrose, and starch in the mutants were decreased significantly, and the mutagenesis of the **OsPPa6** gene remarkably lowered the net photosynthetic rate of rice mutants, thus reducing the contents of soluble sugar and proline, but remarkably increasing MDA, osmotic potentials and Na+/K+ ratio in the mutants under AS.
   - Mutagenesis Reveals That the **OsPPa6** Gene Is Required for Enhancing the Alkaline Tolerance in Rice.
   - This study suggests that the **OsPPa6** gene is an important osmotic regulatory factor in rice, and the gene-editing of CRISPR/Cas9-guided is an effective method evaluating the responsive regulation of the stress-induced gene, and simultaneously provides a scientific support for the application of the gene encoding a soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase in molecular breeding.
