## Functional Descriptions:
   - The stress-related genes activated by **OsbZIP46**CA1 are largely different from those activated by the other rice ABF/AREB homologs (such as OsbZIP23), further implying the value of **OsbZIP46**CA1 in genetic engineering of drought tolerance.
   - Constitutive activation of transcription factor **OsbZIP46** improves drought tolerance in rice.
   - A homozygous T-DNA insertional mutant of **OsABF2** is more sensitive to salinity, drought, and oxidative stress compared with wild type plants.
   - In addition, the **ABL1** mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous indole-3-acetic acid, and some ABRE-containing genes related to auxin metabolism or signaling are altered under **ABL1** deficiency, suggesting that **ABL1** modulates ABA and auxin responses by directly regulating the ABRE-containing genes.
   - Overexpression of the native **OsbZIP46** gene increased ABA sensitivity but had no positive effect on drought resistance.
   - These results suggest that **OsbZIP46** is a positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance of rice depending on its activation.
   - Together, it is suggested that a nuclear PP2C protein OsSIPP2C1 negatively regulated by **ABL1** is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice.
   - A novel nuclear protein phosphatase 2C negatively regulated by **ABL1** is involved in abiotic stress and panicle development in rice.
   - Due to the dates, **OsAREB1** may function as a positive regulator in drought/heat stresses response, but a negative regulator in flowering time in Arabiclopsis.
   - OsSIPP2C1 expression was up-regulated by high salt, PEG6000 and exogenous ABA, and enhanced in the **ABL1** mutant under normal, salt, or drought condition.
   - **ABL1** is expressed in various tissues and is induced by the hormones ABA and indole-3-acetic acid and stress conditions including salinity, drought, and osmotic pressure.
   - Expression of **OsbZIP46** was strongly induced by drought, heat, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment; however, it was not induced by salt and cold stresses.
   - Overexpression of **OsbZIP46**CA1 in rice significantly increased tolerance to drought and osmotic stresses.
   - The **ABL1** deficiency mutant, **ABL1**, shows suppressed ABA responses, and **ABL1** expression in the Arabidopsis abi5 mutant rescued the ABA sensitivity.
   - Trdnsgenic Arabidopsis over-expressing **OsAREB1** had different responses to ABA and glucose compared to wild-type plants, which suggest **OsAREB1** might have a crucial role in these two signaling pathways.
   - **OsAREB1**, an ABRE-binding protein responding to ABA and glucose, has multiple functions in Arabidopsis.
   - In our current study, we have isolated and characterized a group A bZIP transcription factor in rice, **OsABF2** (Oryza sativa ABA-responsive element binding factor 2).
   - The ABRE-binding bZIP transcription factor **OsABF2** is a positive regulator of abiotic stress and ABA signaling in rice.
   - Here, we report the functional identification of rice (Oryza sativa) ABI5-Like1 (**ABL1**), which is a basic region/leucine zipper motif transcription factor.
   - Collectively, our present results indicate that **OsABF2** functions as a transcriptional regulator that modulates the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes through an ABA-dependent pathway.
   - Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of **OsAREB8** from rice, a member of the AREB/ABF family of bZIP transcription factors, in complex with its cognate DNA.
   - First, **OsAREB1** transgenic plants had higher resistance to drought and heat, and **OsAREB1** up-regulated the ABA/stress related gene such as RD29A and RD29B.
   - In addition, this **OsABF2** mutant showed a significantly decreased sensitivity to high levels of ABA at germination and post-germination.
   - **OsbZIP46** is one member of the third subfamily of bZIP transcription factors in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - SiMYB19 overexpression promotes abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation in transgenic rice and upregulates the ABA synthesis gene OsNCED3 and the ABA signal transduction pathway-related genes OsPK1 and **OsABF2**.
   - Further investigation revealed that the transcription factor basic region and leucine zipper 46 (**OsbZIP46**), involved in ABA signaling, can directly bind to the YUCCA8/rice ethylene-insensitive 7 (OsYUC8/REIN7) promoter to activate its expression, and genetic analysis revealed that OsYUC8/REIN7 is located downstream of **OsbZIP46**.
