## Functional Descriptions:
   - Sequence search revealed that CYP78A13 has a paralogue Grain<U+2005>Length 3.2 (**GL3.2**, LOC_Os03g30420) in rice with distinct expression patterns, analysis of transgenic plants harbouring either CYP78A13 or **GL3.2** showed that both can promote grain growth.
   - Both CYP78A13 and **GL3.2** promote seed growth in rice.
   - It was predicted that CYP78A13 was associated with grain width, while another P450 paralogue located on chromosome 3, LOC_Os03g30420, which we named Grain Length3.2 (**GL3.2**), was associated with grain length.
   - Overexpression of CYP78A13 and **GL3.2** both resulted in enlarged grain sizes.
