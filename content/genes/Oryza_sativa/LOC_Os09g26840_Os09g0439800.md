## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we demonstrate that alteration of root system architecture improves drought avoidance through the cloning and characterization of DEEPER ROOTING 1 (**DRO1**), a rice quantitative trait locus controlling root growth angle.
   - **DRO1** is negatively regulated by auxin and is involved in cell elongation in the root tip that causes asymmetric root growth and downward bending of the root in response to gravity.
   - Introducing **DRO1** into a shallow-rooting rice cultivar by backcrossing enabled the resulting line to avoid drought by increasing deep rooting, which maintained high yield performance under drought conditions relative to the recipient cultivar.
   - The RDR QTL **DRO1** (Deeper rooting 1) was mapped between the markers RM24393 and RM7424, which delimit a 608.
   - To clarify the influence of **DRO1** in an upland field, the root distribution in different soil layers was quantified by means of core sampling.
   - A line homozygous for the KP allele of **DRO1** (**DRO1**-KP) and IR64 did not differ in root dry weight in the shallow soil layers (0-25 cm), but root dry weight of **DRO1**-KP in deep soil layers (25-50 cm) was significantly greater than that of IR64, suggesting that **DRO1** plays a crucial role in increased deep rooting under upland field conditions.
   - **DRO1**, a major QTL involved in deep rooting of rice under upland field conditions.
   - Higher expression of **DRO1** increases the root growth angle, whereby roots grow in a more downward direction.
   - Rice varieties with a high and auxin-mediated transcription of **DRO1** in the root tip show deeper and longer root phenotypes and are thus better adapted to drought.
   - INDITTO2 transposon conveys auxin-mediated **DRO1** transcription for rice drought avoidance.
   - In the rice Acuce, which displays **DRO1**-mediated drought adaptation, the INDITTO2 transposon was found to be inserted at the promoter region of the **DRO1** locus.
   - Transgenesis-based insertion of the INDITTO2 transposon into the **DRO1** promoter of the non-adapted rice variety Nipponbare was sufficient to promote its drought avoidance.
   - Allele mining for a drought responsive gene **DRO1** determining root growth angle in donors of drought tolerance in rice ( Oryza sativa L.).
   - The information on structural variations in **DRO1** gene will be very useful for the breeders, especially in the light of recent breeding programmes on improving drought tolerance using several DTY donors and upland accessions.
