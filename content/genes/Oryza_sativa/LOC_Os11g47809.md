- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Both transgenic plants and yeasts harboring **OsMT1a** accumulated more Zn(2+) than wild type controls, suggesting **OsMT1a** is most likely to be involved in zinc homeostasis.
   - Furthermore, the transcripts of several Zn(2+)-induced CCCH zinc finger transcription factors accumulated in **OsMT1a** transgenic plants, suggesting that **OsMT1a** not only participates directly in ROS scavenging pathway but also regulates expression of the zinc finger transcription factors via the alteration of Zn(2+) homeostasis, which leads to improved plant stress tolerance.
   - **OsMT1a**, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice.
   - The **rgMT** gene expression was induced in rice leaves and roots under several abiotic stresses from salts (NaCl and NaHCO3), drought (PEG) and metals (CuCl2, ZnCl2, CdCl2).
   - A metallothionein-like protein of rice (**rgMT**) functions in E. coli and its gene expression is induced by abiotic stresses.
   - Expression analysis revealed that **OsMT1a** predominantly expressed in the roots, and was induced by dehydration.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsMT1a** demonstrated enhanced tolerance to drought.
   - Phenotypic analysis revealed that **OsMT1e** overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type.
   - **OsMT1e** was dominantly expressed in roots at all developmental stages and, to less extent, expressed in leaves at vegetative and seed filling stages.
   - Expression of **OsMT1e** in a yeast Cd-sensitive strain ycf1 conferred cellular tolerance to Cd, even though the ycf1 + **OsMT1e** cells accumulated more Cd than the control cells (ycf1 + pYES2).
   - **OsMT1e** was mainly targeted to the nucleus and substantially induced by Cd exposure.
   - Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene **OsMT1e** for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation.
