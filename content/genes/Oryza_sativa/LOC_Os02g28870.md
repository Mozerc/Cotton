## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cytological and transcriptome analyses reveal **OsPUB73** defect affects the gene expression associated with tapetum or pollen exine abnormality in rice.
   - In the present study, we knocked out **OsPUB73** by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and studied the cytological and transcriptome of the gene-defect associated with pollen development and sterility in the rice variety (Taichung 65).
   - The **OsPUB73** displayed low pollen fertility (19.
   - Cytological observation showed tapetum vacuolated at the meiosis stage and pollen exine was abnormal at the bi-cellular pollen stage of **OsPUB73**.
   - These results suggested **OsPUB73** may play an important role in tapetal or pollen exine development and resulted in pollen partial sterility.
   - The expression pattern of **OsPUB73** showed that it was highly expressed in the anther during meiosis stage.
   - RNA-seq analysis detected 2240 down and 571 up-regulated genes in anther of **OsPUB73** compared with WT during meiosis stage.
   - Our results revealed that **OsPUB73** plays an important role in rice male reproductive development, which provides valuable information about the molecular mechanisms of the U-box in rice male reproductive development.
