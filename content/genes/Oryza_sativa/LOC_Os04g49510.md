- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Over-expression of **OsCDPK7** enhanced induction of some stress-responsive genes in response to salinity/drought, but not to cold.
   - A rice Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, **OsCDPK7**, is a positive regulator commonly involved in the tolerance to cold and salt/drought.
   - The transcript of a putative target gene of the **OsCDPK7** signaling pathway, rab16A, was also detected essentially in the same tissues upon salt stress, suggesting that the **OsCDPK7** pathway operates predominantly in these regions.
   - In the wild-type rice plants under both stress conditions, **OsCDPK7** was expressed predominantly in vascular tissues of crowns and roots, vascular bundles and central cylinder, respectively, where water stress occurs most severely.
   - Similar localization patterns with stronger signals were observed in stress-tolerant **OsCDPK7** over-expressing transformants with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter.
   - A rice gene encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK), **OsCDPK7**, was induced by cold and salt stresses.
   - The extent of tolerance to cold and salt/drought stresses of these plants correlated well with the level of **OsCDPK7** expression.
