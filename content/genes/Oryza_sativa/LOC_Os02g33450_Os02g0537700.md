- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Heterologous **OsTPX** expression increased the ability of the transgenic yeast cells to adapt and recover from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stresses, such as a reduction of cellular hydroperoxide levels in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and menadione, by improving redox homeostasis.
   - These results suggest that heterologous **OsTPX** expression increases acquired tolerance to ROS-induced oxidative stress by improving cellular redox homeostasis and improves fermentation capacity due to improved cell survival during fermentation, especially at a high temperature.
   - Furthermore, high **OsTPX** expression improved the fermentation capacity of the yeast during glucose-based batch fermentation at a high temperature (40 degrees C) and at the general cultivation temperature (30 degrees C).
   - In this study, a putative chloroplastic 2-Cys thioredoxin peroxidase (**OsTPX**) was identified by proteome analysis from leaf tissue samples of rice (Oryza sativa) seedlings exposed to 0.
   - The alcohol yield in **OsTPX**-expressing transgenic yeast increased by approximately 29 % (0.
   - We found that **OsPRX2** was localized in the chloroplast.
   - **OsPRX2** contributes to stomatal closure and improves potassium deficiency tolerance in rice..
   - In this study, a rice homologue gene of At2-CysPrxB, **OsPRX2** was investigated aiming to characterize the effect of 2-Cys Prxs on the K(+)-deficiency tolerance in rice.
   - Overexpressed **OsPRX2** causes the stomatal closing and K(+)-deficiency tolerance increasing, while knockout of **OsPRX2** lead to serious defects in leaves phenotype and the stomatal opening under the K(+)-deficiency tolerance.
   - Detection of K(+) accumulation, antioxidant activity of transgenic plants under the starvation of potassium, further confirmed that **OsPRX2** is a potential target for engineering plants with improved potassium deficiency tolerance.
