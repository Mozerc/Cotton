## Functional Descriptions:
   - Disruption of this gene in **OsCyb5** mutants reduced the seed reserve mobilization and seedling growth compared with wild-type (WT) in rice.
   - There were no significant differences of grain size, starch, protein and total soluble sugar content in the mature grains between **OsCyb5** mutants and WT.
   - However, the Î±-amylase activity in the germinating seeds of **OsCyb5** mutants was significantly decreased compared to that of WT, and then, the starch and sugar mobilization and the glucose accumulation during seed germination were significantly decreased in **OsCyb5** mutants.
   - Two elite haplotypes of **OsCyb5** associated with the higher seed reserve mobilization percentage and its elite single nucleotide polymorphism variations were mainly existed in the INDICA and AUS accessions.
   - The natural variation of **OsCyb5** contributing to seed reserve mobilization might be useful for the future rice breeding.
