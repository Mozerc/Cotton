## Functional Descriptions:
   - In plants, iron (Fe) is essential for **MIT**ochondrial electron transport, heme, and Fe-Sulphur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis; however, plant **MIT**ochondrial Fe transporters have not been identified.
   - Here we show, identify and characterize the rice **MIT**ochondrial Fe transporter (**MIT**).
   - These results indicate that **MIT** is a **MIT**ochondrial Fe transporter essential for rice growth and development.
   - The rice **MIT**ochondrial iron transporter is essential for plant growth.
   - The screening of 3,993 mutant lines for symptoms of Fe deficiency resulted in the identification and characterization of a major **MIT**ochondrial Fe transporter (**MIT**) in rice.
   - Identification and characterization of the major **MIT**ochondrial Fe transporter in rice.
   - Here, we discuss the characterization of a rice vacuolar Fe transporter 2 (OsVIT2) T-DNA insertion line (osvit2) and report that the knockdown of OsVIT2 and **MIT**ochondrial Fe transporter (**MIT**) expression affects seed Fe localization.
   - **MIT** localized to the **MIT**ochondria and complemented the growth of Deltamrs3Deltamrs4 yeast defective in **MIT**ochondrial Fe transport.
   - The growth of **MIT**-knockdown (**MIT**-2) plants was also significantly impaired despite abundant Fe accumulation.
   - **MIT** was found to localize to **MIT**ochondria and to complement the growth of a yeast strain defective in **MIT**ochondrial Fe transport.
   - Further, the decrease in the activity of the **MIT**ochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S enzyme, aconitase, indicated that Fe-S cluster synthesis is affected in **MIT**-2 plants.
   - The knock-out of **MIT** resulted in a lethal phenotype, and in knock-down plants, several agronomic characteristics were compromised, such as plant height, average number of tillers, days to flower, fertility, and yield.
   - The knockdown of OsVIT2 and **MIT** affects iron localization in rice seed.
   - Previously, we reported that the expression of OsVIT2 was higher in **MIT** knockdown (**MIT**-2) plants, and in this study, the accumulation of Fe in **MIT**-2 seeds decreased significantly.
   - Moreover, changes in the expression of OsVIT2 and **MIT** affect the concentration and localization of metals in brown rice as well as in polished rice seeds.
   - Despite rapid progress in our understanding of Fe homeostasis in plants, Fe transport from the cytoplasm to **MIT**ochondria was, until recently, poorly understood.
   - Furthermore, the **MIT**ochondrial Fe concentration and the activity of the **MIT**ochondrial Fe-S enzyme aconitase were significantly reduced compared with wild-type plants.
