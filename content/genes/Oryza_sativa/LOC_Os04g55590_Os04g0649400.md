## Functional Descriptions:
   - Inducible downregulation of **OsWOX4** resulted in severe defects in leaf development, such as an arrest of vascular differentiation, a partial defect in the early cell proliferation required for midrib formation, and a failure to maintain cellular activity in general parenchyma cells.
   - Transcriptome analysis further showed that **OsWOX4** regulates multiple genes, including those responsible for cell cycle progression and hormone action, consistent with the effects of **OsWOX4** downregulation on leaf phenotypes.
   - Collectively, these results suggest that **OsWOX4** acts as a key regulator at an early stage of leaf development.
   - In situ analysis showed that knockdown of **OsWOX4** reduced the expression of two LONELY GUY genes, which function in the synthesis of active cytokinin, in developing vascular bundles.
   - Our previous work revealed that **OsWOX4** is involved in the maintenance of shoot apical meristem in rice, whereas AtWOX4 is specifically associated with the maintenance of vascular stem cells in Arabidopsis.
   - Consistent with this, cytokinin levels were downregulated by **OsWOX4** knockdown.
   - The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor **OsWOX4** controls the primary root elongation by activating OsAUX1 in rice.
   - Silencing of **OsWOX4** by RNA interference (RNAi) greatly increased the primary root length, whereas its overexpression reduced primary root elongation significantly.
   - Collectively, our results indicated that **OsWOX4** played a crucial role in the primary root elongation by regulating auxin transport, suggesting its importance in rice root system architecture.
   - The expression of genes responsible for auxin biosynthesis and transport was also changed in **OsWOX4** transgenic lines.
   - Further analysis showed that the accumulation of free IAA was slightly increased in RNAi roots, but drastically reduced in plants overexpressing **OsWOX4**.
