## Functional Descriptions:
   - Vacuolar membrane transporters OsVIT1 and **OsVIT2** modulate iron translocation between flag leaves and seeds in rice.
   - The accumulation of zinc, copper, and manganese also changed significantly in the shoots of **OsVIT2** plants.
   - Here, we discuss the characterization of a rice vacuolar Fe transporter 2 (**OsVIT2**) T-DNA insertion line (**OsVIT2**) and report that the knockdown of **OsVIT2** and mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT) expression affects seed Fe localization.
   - The concentration of Fe increased in **OsVIT2** polished seeds.
   - Previously, we reported that the expression of **OsVIT2** was higher in MIT knockdown (mit-2) plants, and in this study, the accumulation of Fe in mit-2 seeds decreased significantly.
   - Moreover, changes in the expression of **OsVIT2** and MIT affect the concentration and localization of metals in brown rice as well as in polished rice seeds.
   - The knockdown of **OsVIT2** and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed.
   - Interestingly, functional disruption of OsVIT1 and **OsVIT2** leads to increased Fe/Zn accumulation in rice seeds and a corresponding decrease in the source organ flag leaves, indicating an enhanced Fe/Zn translocation between source and sink organs, which might represent a novel strategy to biofortify Fe/Zn in staple foods.
   - FINDINGS: **OsVIT2** plants accumulated less Fe in their shoots when grown under normal or excess Fe conditions, while the accumulation of Fe was comparable to that in wild-type (WT) plants under Fe-deficient conditions.
   - In rice, OsVIT1 and **OsVIT2** are highly expressed in flag leaf blade and sheath, respectively, and in contrast to OsVIT1, **OsVIT2** is highly responsive to Fe treatments.
   - The growth of **OsVIT2** plants was also slow compared to that of WT plants.
   - **OsVIT2** was expressed in the parenchyma cell bridges of nodes, in the mestome sheath of leaf sheath and aleurone of the caryopsis.
   - Mutation of **OsVIT2** resulted in decreased Fe distribution to the leaf sheath, nodes, and aleurone, but increased Fe to the leaf blade and grains.
   - These results indicate that **OsVIT2** is involved in the distribution of Fe to the grains through sequestering Fe into vacuoles in mestome sheath, nodes, and aleurone layer and that knockout of this gene provides a potential way for Fe biofortification without yield penalty.
   - Role of a vacuolar iron transporter **OsVIT2** in the distribution of iron to rice grains.
   - We functionally characterized a vacuolar iron transporter gene, **OsVIT2** in terms of expression pattern, cellular localization, and mutant phenotypes.
   - OsFER2 knock-out in wild-type rice HY did not induce ROS and ferric ion (Fe(3+)) accumulation, lipid peroxidation and hypersensitive response (HR) cell death, and also downregulated the defense-related genes OsPAL1, OsPR1-b, OsRbohB, OsNADP-ME2-3, OsMEK2 and OsMPK1, and vacuolar membrane transporter **OsVIT2** expression.
