## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g28060](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g28060)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0416200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0416200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ONI2</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The midrib of **ONI2** leaf blades was not developed correctly.
   - onion2 (**ONI2**) mutants produced very small shoots in which leaves were fused to each other, and ceased growing after germination.
   - These results suggest that **ONI2** is a layer 1-specific gene required for development of the entire shoot and that VLCFAs play an essential role in normal shoot development in rice.
