## Functional Descriptions:
   - Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the **GID2** mutant.
   - In **GID2**, a repressor for GA signaling, SLR1, was highly accumulated in a phosphorylated form and GA increased its concentration, whereas SLR1 was rapidly degraded by GA through ubiquitination in the wild type.
   - We conclude that **GID2** is a positive regulator of GA signaling and that regulated degradation of SLR1 is initiated through GA-dependent phosphorylation and finalized by an SCF(**GID2**)-proteasome pathway.
   - Enhanced resistance was correlated with **GF14e** silencing prior to and after development of the LM phenotype, higher basal expression of a defense response peroxidase gene (POX22.
   - Together, our findings suggest that **GF14e** negatively affects the induction of plant defense response genes, cell death and broad-spectrum resistance in rice.
   - Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), **GID2** and SLR1.
   - We isolated and characterized a rice GA-insensitive dwarf mutant, **GID2**.
   - It is assumed that interaction between GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) and the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 triggers F-box protein **GID2**-mediated SLR1 degradation.
   - To determine whether the **GF14e** gene plays a direct role in resistance to disease in rice, we suppressed its expression by RNAi silencing.
   - Rice 14-3-3 protein (**GF14e**) negatively affects cell death and disease resistance.
   - **GF14e**-silenced rice plants showed high levels of resistance to a virulent strain of Xoo compared with plants that were not silenced.
   - GA perception by GID1 causes SLR1 protein degradation involving the F-box protein **GID2**; this triggers GA-associated responses such as shoot elongation and seed germination.
   - Previously, we identified a rice F-box protein, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf2 (**GID2**), which is essential for GA-mediated DELLA protein degradation.
   - **GID2**, an F-box subunit of the SCF E3 complex, specifically interacts with phosphorylated SLR1 protein and regulates the gibberellin-dependent degradation of SLR1 in rice.
   - The level of SLR1 protein in **GID2** was decreased by loss of GID1 function or treatment with a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, and dwarfism was enhanced.
   - These results indicate that derepression of SLR1 repressive activity can be accomplished by GA and GID1 alone and does not require F-box (**GID2**) function.
   - Evidence for GA signaling without **GID2** was also provided by the expression behavior of GA-regulated genes such as GA-20oxidase1, GID1, and SLR1 in the **GID2** mutant.
   - An exception is the GA-insensitive F-box mutant **GID2**, which shows milder dwarfism than mutants such as gid1 and cps even though it accumulates higher levels of SLR1.
   - Conversely, overproduction of GID1 or treatment with GA(3) increased the SLR1 level in **GID2** and reduced dwarfism.
   - **OsGF14e** positively regulates panicle blast resistance in rice.
   - Rice black streaked dwarf virus P7-2 forms a SCF complex through binding to Oryza sativa SKP1-like proteins, and interacts with **GID2** involved in the gibberellin pathway.
   - Overall, these results indicated that P7-2 functioned as a component of the SCF complex in rice, and interaction of P7-2 with **GID2** implied possible roles of the GA signaling pathway during RBSDV infection.
