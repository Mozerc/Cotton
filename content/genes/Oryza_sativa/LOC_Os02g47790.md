## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g47790](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g47790)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0707000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0707000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsMDHAR4
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsMDHAR4** expression was detected in all tissues surveyed and peaked in leaf blade.
   - In rice, however, the detailed roles of **OsMDHAR4** in resistance against heat stress remains unclear.
   - Suppression of **OsMDHAR4** enhances heat tolerance by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice plants.
   - In comparison with wild type, the **OsMDHAR4** mutant exhibited improved tolerance to heat stress, whereas **OsMDHAR4** overexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to heat stress.
   - Taken together, these results indicated that **OsMDHAR4** negatively regulates tolerance to heat stress by mediating H2O2-induced stomatal closure in rice.
   - Moreover, we found that suppression of **OsMDHAR4** promoted stomatal closure and hydrogen peroxide accumulation, and overexpression of **OsMDHAR4** increased stomatal opening and decreased hydrogen peroxide content in rice leaves.
