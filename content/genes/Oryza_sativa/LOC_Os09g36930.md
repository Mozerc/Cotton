## Functional Descriptions:
   - qRT-PCR analysis of PIPs in rice root and shoot tissues revealed a significant down regulation of transcripts encoding OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and **OsPIP2;7** in response to arsenite treatment.
   - Overexpression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and **OsPIP2;7** in Arabidopsis yielded enhanced arsenite tolerance and higher biomass accumulation.
   - Transcript analysis demonstrated that the expression of OsPIP2;4 and **OsPIP2;7** were downregulated in shoots and strongly upregulated in rice roots by high B treatment.
   - Arabidopsis lines overexpressing OsPIP2;4 and **OsPIP2;7** showed significantly higher biomass production and greater root length, however there was no difference in B accumulation in long term uptake assay.
   - Short-term uptake assay using tracer B ((1)(0)B) in shoots and roots demonstrated increased (1)(0)B accumulation in Arabidopsis lines expressing OsPIP2;4 and **OsPIP2;7**, compare to wild type control plants.
   - Efflux assay of B in the roots showed that (1)(0)B was effluxed from the Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing OsPIP2;4 or **OsPIP2;7** during the initial 1-h of assay.
   - These data indicate that OsPIP2;4 and **OsPIP2;7** are involved in mediating B transport in rice and provide tolerance via efflux of excess B from roots and shoot tissues.
   - Two rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, OsPIP2;4 and **OsPIP2;7**, are involved in transport and providing tolerance to boron toxicity.
   - We have previously shown that a rice gene, **OsPIP2;7**, was generally up-regulated in roots but down-regulated in shoots at the early stage of chilling stress.
   - Heterologous expression of OsPIP2;4, OsPIP2;6, and **OsPIP2;7** in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of arsenite.
   - Furthermore, **OsPIP2;7** enhanced the transpiration rate and tolerance to low temperature when overexpressed in rice.
   - These results indicated that **OsPIP2;7** was involved in rapid water transport and maintenance of the water balance in cells, and ultimately improves the tolerance of yeast and rice to low temperature stress.
