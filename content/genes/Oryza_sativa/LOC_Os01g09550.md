## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression (OE) of **SNAC3** in rice resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature, drought, and oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen (MV), whereas suppression of **SNAC3** by RNAi resulted in increased sensitivity to these stresses.
   - A stress-responsive NAC transcription factor **SNAC3** confers heat and drought tolerance through modulation of reactive oxygen species in rice.
   - Here, a stress-responsive NAC gene, **SNAC3** (ONAC003, LOC_Os01g09550), conferring drought and heat tolerance in rice is reported.
   - These results suggest that **SNAC3** plays important roles in stress responses, and it is likely to be useful for engineering crops with improved tolerance to heat and drought stress.
   - **SNAC3** was ubiquitously expressed and its transcript level was induced by drought, high temperature, salinity stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
   - The **SNAC3**-OE transgenic plants exhibited significantly lower levels of H2O2, malondiadehyde (MDA), and relative electrolyte leakage than the wild-type control under heat stress conditions, implying that **SNAC3** may confer stress tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis.
   - NAC transcription factor **ONAC066** positively regulates disease resistance by suppressing the ABA signaling pathway in rice.
   - Overexpression of **ONAC066** quantitatively enhances resistance to blast disease and bacterial blight in rice.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that **ONAC066** positively regulates rice resistance to blast and bacterial blight, and **ONAC066** exerts its functions on disease resistance by modulating of ABA signaling pathway, sugars and amino acids accumulation in rice.
   - Consistently, lower endogenous ABA levels are identified in **ONAC066** overexpressing plants compared with wild-type plants before and after blast inoculation, while no significant differences are observed for the SA and JA levels.
   - Further analysis shows that overexpression of **ONAC066** remarkably suppresses the expression of ABA-related genes, whereas there  are no obvious differences for salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA)-related genes between wild-type and **ONAC066** overexpressing plants.
   - Here we report that the NAC gene **ONAC066** (LOC_Os01g09550) is significantly activated by rice blast infection.
   - **ONAC066** is ubiquitously expressed and this protein is localized in the nucleus.
   - Moreover, the metabolomic study reveals that the **ONAC066** overexpressing plants accumulated higher contents of soluble sugars and amino acids both before and after pathogen attack, when compared to wild-type plants.
   - Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) strongly activates the transcription of **ONAC066** in rice.
   - Rice NAC transcription factor **ONAC066** functions as a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress response.
   - Overexpression of **ONAC066** in transgenic rice improved drought and oxidative stress tolerance and increased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with decreased rate of water loss, increased contents of proline and soluble sugars, decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition.
   - By contrast, RNAi-mediated suppression of **ONAC066** attenuated drought and oxidative stress tolerance and decreased ABA sensitivity, accompanied with increased rate of water loss, decreased contents of proline and soluble sugars, elevated accumulation of ROS and downregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress condition.
   - Functional analyses using overexpression and RNAi-mediated suppression transgenic lines demonstrate that **ONAC066** is a positive regulator of drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice.
   - **ONAC066** is a nucleus-localized transcription activator that can respond to multiple abiotic stress factors.
   - Expression of **ONAC066** was significantly induced by PEG, NaCl, H2O2 and abscisic acid (ABA).
   - **ONAC066** was localized in nuclei of cells when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and is a transcription activator with the binding ability to NAC recognition sequence (NACRS) and AtJUB1 binding site (JBS).
   - Knockout of the **OsNAC006** Transcription Factor Causes Drought and Heat Sensitivity in Rice.
   - Furthermore, knockout of **OsNAC006** using the CRISPR-Cas9 system resulted in drought and heat sensitivity.
   - Our findings elucidate the important role of **OsNAC006** in drought responses, and provide valuable information for genetic manipulation to enhance stress tolerance in future plant breeding programs.
   - Herein, we discovered that the TF **OsNAC006** is constitutively expressed in rice, and regulated by H2O2, cold, heat, abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin (GA), NaCl, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatments.
   - The present study investigated the function and mechanism of **ONAC066** in rice immunity.
   - **ONAC066** shows transcription activator activity that depends on its C-terminal region in rice cells.
