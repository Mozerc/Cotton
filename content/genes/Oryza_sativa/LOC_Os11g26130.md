## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os11g26130](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os11g26130)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os11g0448000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os11g0448000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsWSS1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In addition, we found that the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) was significantly higher, while the expression of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis was significantly downregulated in **OsWSS1** as compared with the wild type.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **OsWSS1** encodes transmembrane kinase TMK1.
   - Mutation of **OsWSS1** led to hyper-accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), more severe DNA fragmentation, and cell death than that of the wild-type control.
   - **OsWSS1** was constitutively expressed in all tissues and its encoded protein is localized to the plasma membrane.
   - Moreover, **OsWSS1** exhibits slightly rolled leaves with irregular epidermal cells, decreased chlorophyll contents, and defective stomata and chloroplasts as compared with the wild type.
