## Functional Descriptions:
   - This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named **THIS1**).
   - **THIS1** is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice.
   - Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of **THIS1** plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation.
   - The seed-setting rate of **THIS1** was less than half that of the wild type, owing to defects in pollen maturation, anther dehiscence, and flower opening.
   - In the **THIS1** mutant, however, the accelerated rate of branching was delayed until the stem elongation stage, while other mutants lost the ability to control branching at all developmental stages.
   - Thus, **THIS1** provides joint control between shoot branching and reproductive development.
   - Homology searches revealed that **THIS1** is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control.
   - The relative change in expression of marker genes highlighted the possibility that **THIS1** is involved in phytohormone signalling pathways, such as those for strigolactone and auxin.
   - Histological analyses showed that the mutation in **THIS1** resulted in anisotropic cell expansion and cell division.
