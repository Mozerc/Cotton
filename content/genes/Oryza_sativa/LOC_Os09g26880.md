## Functional Descriptions:
   - These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when **OsALDH7** expression began to increase significantly.
   - Interestingly, endosperms from the **OsALDH7** null mutants accumulated brown pigments during desiccation and storage.
   - Using diï¬€erential display RT-PCR and cDNA library screening, a full-length aldehyde dehydrogenase cDNA (**ALDH7B7**) was isolated from rice leaves infected by incompatible race of blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.
   - **ALDH7B7** expression was induced by blast fungus infection, ultraviolet, mechanical wound in rice leaves and was not detected in untreated rice organs.
   - The function of **ALDH7B7** in the interaction process between blast fungus and rice is discussed.
   - These results suggest that **OsALDH7** is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation.
   - These data imply that **OsALDH7** plays an important role in maintaining seed viability by detoxifying the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation.
   - Here we reported a mutant with yellow-colored endosperm in rice, and showed that the yellow endosperm was caused by mutation of **OsALDH7**.
   - Mutation of **OsALDH7** causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice.
   - We obtained T-DNA insertional mutants in **OsALDH7**, which is remarkably inducible by oxidative and abiotic stresses.
   - **OsALDH7** is expressed in all tissues detected, with the highest level in mature seeds.
