## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Os4BGlu12** expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli hydrolyzed β-(1,3;1,4)-glucooligosaccharides generated by the wounding-induced rice endo-(1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase OsEGL1, suggesting that both enzymes may act in concert in remodeling of damaged cell wall.
   - The amino acid residues predicted to line the active site of **Os4BGlu12** are more similar to those of cyanogenic and flavonoid β-glucosidases than oligosaccharide hydrolases, and it may function in defense, as well as in cell wall-derived oligosaccharide break-down.
   - Rice **Os4BGlu12** is a wound-induced β-glucosidase that hydrolyzes cell wall-β-glucan-derived oligosaccharides and glycosides.
   - Rice **Os4BGlu12** β-glucosidase is a family 1 glycoside hydrolase, the transcript levels of which have previously been found to be induced in response to herbivore attack and salinity stress.
   - Here, high levels of **Os4BGlu12** transcripts were also detected in the shoot during germination, in the leaf sheath and stem of mature rice plants under normal growth conditions.
   - The cDNA of the **Os4BGlu12** gene, which encodes a protein identical at 40 of 44 amino acid residues with the N-terminal sequence of a cell wall-bound enzyme previously purified from germinating rice, was isolated by RT-PCR from rice seedlings.
   - To begin this analysis, **Os4BGlu12** beta-glucosidase was characterized and found to have high exoglucanase activity, consistent with a role in cell wall metabolism.
   - Native **Os4BGlu12** and its complex with 2,4-dinitrophenyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-beta-D-glucopyranoside (DNP2FG) were crystallized using 19% polyethylene glycol (3350 or 2000, respectively) in 0.
