- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Map-based cloning revealed that all of the observed mutant phenotypes result from a missense mutation in a putative NST gene, Oryza sativa Nucleotide Sugar Transporter1 (**OsNST1**).
   - **OsNST1** was identified as a Golgi-localized transporter by analysis of a fluorescence-tagged **OsNST1** expressed in rice protoplast cells and demonstration of UDP-glucose transport activity via uptake assays in yeast.
   - The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that **OsNST1** has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth.
   - Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that **OsNST1** supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis.
   - A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm14 (**BC14**), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development.
   - Identification of **OsNST1** has improved our understanding of how cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is regulated by Golgi NSTs in plants.
   - We previously examined cell wall composition of **BC14** and wild type plants.
