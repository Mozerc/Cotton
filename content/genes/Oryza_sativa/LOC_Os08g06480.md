## Functional Descriptions:
   - Close examination revealed that regulation of meristem fate was compromised in **ASP1**: degeneration of the inflorescence meristem was delayed, transition from the branch meristem to the spikelet meristem was accelerated, and stem cell maintenance in both the branch meristem and the spikelet meristem was compromised.
   - It is likely that the pleiotropic defects are associated with de-repression of multiple genes related to meristem function in the **ASP1** mutant.
   - Here we analyzed a recessive mutant of rice, aberrant spikelet and panicle1 (**ASP1**), that showed pleiotropic phenotypes such as a disorganized branching pattern, aberrant spikelet morphology, and disarrangement of phyllotaxy.
   - The **ASP1** mutant also showed de-repression of axillary bud growth and disturbed phyllotaxy in the vegetative phase, suggesting that the function of this gene is closely associated with auxin action.
   - Cytological examination confirmed that **OsLIS-L1** does not affect the meiosis in pollen mother cells.
   - Compared with wild type, the **OsLIS-L1** mutant had abnormal male gametophyte formation, but anther cell wall and pollen wall development were not affected.
   - Consistent with these observations and the molecular function of Arabidopsis TPL, auxin signaling was also compromised in the rice **ASP1** mutant.
   - Two independent alleles, designated **OsLIS-L1**-1 and **OsLIS-L1**-2, exhibited similar abnormal developmental phenotypes, including semi-dwarf, shorter panicle length, and reduced male fertility.
   - **OsLIS-L1** transcript is relatively highly abundant in stem and panicle and has a dynamic expression pattern at different panicle developmental stages.
   - Histological analysis revealed that **OsLIS-L1** regulates the cell proliferation in the first internode under the panicle.
   - **OsLIS-L1** encoding a lissencephaly type-1-like protein with WD40 repeats is required for plant height and male gametophyte formation in rice.
   - Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of a novel rice gene **OsLIS-L1** (Lissencephaly type-1-like 1), which is required for normal fertility and the first internode elongation.
   - These results suggest that **ASP1** and FON2 synergistically regulate stem cell maintenance in rice.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that TPL-like corepressor activity plays a crucial role in meristem maintenance, and that stem cell proliferation is properly maintained via the cooperation of **ASP1** and FON2.
   - Transcriptional corepressor **ASP1** and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.
   - In the fon2 **ASP1** double mutant, the inflorescence was severely affected, resulting in bifurcation of the main axis (rachis), a phenotype that has not previously been reported.
   - A mutant, named as **ASP-LSL** (aberrant spikelet-long sterile lemma), showed a significant decrease in plant height, number of tillers, thousand-grains weight, seed setting rate, spikelet length, kernel length and effective number of grains per panicle as compared to WT.
   - The endogenous contents of GA, CTK, and IAA were found significantly decreased in **ASP-LSL** as compared to WT.
   - Subcellular localization of **ASP-LSL** revealed that its protein is localized in the nucleus.
   - A homologous gene of OsREL2/ASP1, **ASP-LSL** regulates pleiotropic phenotype including long sterile lemma in rice.
   - **ASP-LSL** showed a pleiotropic phenotype coupled with the obvious presence of a long sterile lemma.
