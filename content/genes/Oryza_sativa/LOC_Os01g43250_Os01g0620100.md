## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we revealed that nucleoporin-coding gene **OsSEH1** was a positive regulator of cold stress in rice.
   - Physiological assays showed that the activity of antioxidant enzymes showed a significant difference between **OsSEH1** knock-out lines and wild type under cold stress.
   - Metabolome analysis revealed that the contents of large-scale flavonoids serving as ROS scavengers were lower in **OsSEH1** mutants compared with wild type under cold stress.
   - Transcriptome analysis indicated that the DEGs between **OsSEH1** knock-out lines and wild type plants were enriched in defense response, regulation of hormone levels and oxidation-reduction process.
   - In addition, Exogenous ABA application assays indicated that **OsSEH1** lines had hypersensitive phenotypes compared with wild type plants, suggesting that **OsSEH1** may mediate cold tolerance by regulating ABA levels.
   - Multi-omics approach reveals the contribution of **OsSEH1** to rice cold tolerance..
   - Integration of transcriptomic and metabolic profiling revealed that **OsSEH1** plays a role in the oxidation-reduction process by coordinately regulating genes expression and metabolite accumulation involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthetic pathway.
