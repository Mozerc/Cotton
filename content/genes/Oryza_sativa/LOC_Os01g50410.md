## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsMKKK70** regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice through the OsMKK4-OsMAPK6-OsWRKY53 signaling pathway.
   - Here we demonstrate that the Oryza sativa Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase **OsMKKK70** regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice.
   - The osmkkk62/70 double mutant and the osmkkk55/62/70 triple mutant displayed significantly smaller seeds and a more erect leaf angle compared to the wild type, indicating that **OsMKKK70** functions redundantly with its homologs OsMKKK62 and OsMKKK55.
   - Taken together, these findings suggest that **OsMKKK70** might regulates grain size and leaf angle in rice by activating OsMAPK6 and that **OsMKKK70**, OsMKK4, OsMAPK6, and OsWRKY53 function in a common signaling pathway that controls grain shape and leaf angle.
   - Biochemical analysis demonstrated that **OsMKKK70** is an active kinase and that **OsMKKK70** interacts with OsMKK4 and promotes OsMAPK6 phosphorylation.
   - In this study, a function of **OsMKKK70** (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase 70) in response to CTB was characterized.
   - **OsMKKK70** overexpression (**OsMKKK70**-OE) plants were more sensitive to cold stress at the booting stage with a lower seed setting and pollen fertility, but there was no significant difference between the **OsMKKK70** mutant and WT.
   - Considering the effect of functional redundancy, we further tested the CTB response of osmkkk62/70 and osmkkk55/62/70, the double and triple mutants of **OsMKKK70** with its closest homologs OsMKKK62 and OsMKKK55, and found that osmkkk62/70 and osmkkk55/62/70 displayed significantly increased CTB with a higher seed setting and pollen fertility, indicating that **OsMKKK70** negatively regulates rice CTB.
   - **OsMKKK70** expression was rapidly induced by cold stress at the booting stage.
   - **OsMKKK70** Negatively Regulates Cold Tolerance at Booting Stage in Rice.
   - Together, these findings suggest that **OsMKKK70** negatively regulates rice CTB by fine-tuning GA levels in anthers.
