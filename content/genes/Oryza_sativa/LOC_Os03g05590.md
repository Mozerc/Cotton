## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, the rice **OsAP23** gene, which encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor, was isolated from rice using a yeast-one-hybrid system.
   - The **OsAP23** transcription factor belongs to the B3 group of the ERF subfamily.
   - Germination results for transgenic Arabidopsis plants hosting the **OsAP23** gene revealed greater inhibition at the germination and seedling stages with increasing concentration of NaCl compared to the wild-type plants.
   - In addition, following exposure to high salt concentrations, several stress-responsive regulatory genes were induced to a significantly greater extent in the wild-type lines compared with lines that over-express **OsAP23**.
   - These results suggested that **OsAP23** might be a negative regulator of the salt stress response in higher plants.
   - Exogenous ABA also reduced the rate of germination of transgenic Arabidopsis seeds that over-express **OsAP23** compared with wild-type Arabidopsis seeds.
