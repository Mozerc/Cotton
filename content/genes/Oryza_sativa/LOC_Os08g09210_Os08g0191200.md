## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os08g09210](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os08g09210)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0191200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0191200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** VAL1,GARS
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results demonstrate that **VAL1** is a crucial enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and is involved in regulating chloroplast development, chlorophyll metabolism, and cell division during leaf development in rice.
   - Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that **VAL1** was localized in the chloroplast.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **VAL1** encodes a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase (PurD), the second enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway.
   - Our results indicated that **GARS** was involved in chloroplast development at early leaf development by affecting the expression of plastid-encoded genes.
   - Purine nucleotide biosynthetic gene **GARS** controls early chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - **GARS** protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern in rice protoplasts.
   - In this research, we characterized a novel **GARS** mutant with white striped leaves at the seedling stage.
   - **GARS** encodes an enzyme catalyzing the second step of purine nucleotide biosynthesis and plays an important role to maintain the development of chloroplasts in juvenile plants by affecting the expression of plastid-encoded genes.
