## Functional Descriptions:
   - The results showed that the mutant **OsSIZ1** exhibited the significant changes in several growth and developmental parameters, including primary root length, adventitious root number, plant height, leaf and panicle length, flower formation, and seed-setting rate compared with wild type.
   - The function in the vegetative growth and reproductive development in rice was investigated using **OsSIZ1** mutants containing a T-DNA insertion.
   - **OsSIZ1** Regulates the Vegetative Growth and Reproductive Development in Rice.
   - In addition, ABA-hypersensitivity of siz1-2 seed germination was partially suppressed by **OsSIZ1** and OsSIZ2.
   - Taking together these results indicate that **OsSIZ1** plays an important role in regulating growth and development in rice.
   - Pi concentration in the xylem sap of **OsSIZ1** mutants was significantly higher than that of the wild type under a Pi-sufficient growth regime.
   - **OsSIZ1** is constitutively expressed throughout the vegetative and reproductive growth of rice, with stronger promoter activities in vascular bundles of culms.
   - **OsSIZ1** mutants had shorter primary roots and adventitious roots than wild-type plants, suggesting that **OsSIZ1** is associated with the regulation of root system architecture.
   - Here, we investigated the expression profile of **OsSIZ1** in rice using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and p**OsSIZ1**-GUS transgenic plants, and the function of **OsSIZ1** in the responses to phosphate and nitrogen using a reverse genetics approach.
   - Total nitrogen (N) concentrations in the most detected tissues of **OsSIZ1** mutants were significantly increased compared with the wild type.
   - Total phosphorus (P) and phosphate (Pi) concentrations in both roots and shoots of **OsSIZ1** mutants were significantly increased irrespective of Pi supply conditions compared with the wild type.
   - Analysis of mineral contents in **OsSIZ1** mutants indicated that **OsSIZ1** functions specifically in Pi and N responses, not those of other nutrients examined, in rice.
   - Further, qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of multiple genes involved in Pi starvation signaling and N transport and assimilation were altered in **OsSIZ1** mutants.
   - Together, these results suggested that **OsSIZ1** may act as a regulator of the Pi (N)-dependent responses in rice.
   - We report here that overexpression of **OsSIZ1** in cotton results in higher net photosynthesis and better growth than wild-type cotton under drought and thermal stresses in growth chamber and greenhouse conditions.
   - Overexpression of the Rice SUMO E3 Ligase Gene **OsSIZ1** in Cotton Enhances Drought and Heat Tolerance, and Substantially Improves Fiber Yields in the Field under Reduced Irrigation and Rainfed Conditions.
   - In this report, it is demonstrated that over-expression of the rice gene **OsSIZ1** in Arabidopsis leads to increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses.
   - These results demonstrate that the rice gene **OsSIZ1** has a great potential to be used for improving crop's tolerance to several abiotic stresses.
   - Previous studies showed that overexpression of the Arabidopsis vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase gene AVP1 increases salt and water deficit stress tolerance and overexpression of the rice SUMO E3 ligase gene **OsSIZ1** improves heat and water deficit stress tolerance in transgenic plants.
   - Co-overexpression of AVP1 and **OsSIZ1** in Arabidopsis substantially enhances plant tolerance to drought, salt, and heat stresses.
   - In this report, the effects of co-overexpression of AVP1 and **OsSIZ1** in Arabidopsis on abiotic stress tolerance were studied.
