## Functional Descriptions:
   - We identified the rice AGO gene MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (**MEL1**) from the analysis of seed-sterile mutants.
   - These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after **MEL1** and before PAIR1.
   - In the **MEL1** mutant, chromosome condensation was arrested at early meiotic stages and irregularly sized, multinucleated, and vacuolated pollen mother cells (PMCs) frequently appeared in developing anthers.
   - These results indicate that the germ cell-specific rice **MEL1** gene regulates the cell division of premeiotic germ cells, the proper modification of meiotic chromosomes, and the faithful progression of meiosis, probably via small RNA-mediated gene silencing, but not the initiation and establishment of germ cells themselves.
   - However, expression of MSP1 and **MEL1**, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the dtm1 mutant.
   - Histone H3 modifications are widely reprogrammed during male meiosis I in rice dependently on **MEL1** Argonaute protein.
   - LMR occurred dependently on a rice Argonaute protein, MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (**MEL1**), which is specifically expressed in germ cells prior to meiosis, because LMR was depleted severely in **MEL1** mutant anthers.
   - These results suggest that **MEL1** plays important roles in epigenetic LMR to promote faithful homologous recombination and synapsis in rice meiosis.
   - Interestingly, opposed to the LMR loss in most chromosomal regions, aberrant meiotic protein loading and hyper H3K9me2 accumulation emerged on the nucleolar organizing region in the **MEL1** PMCs.
