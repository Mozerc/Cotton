- **Gene Symbol:** MKRN
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We isolated RNA from embryonic axes of rice seeds at various stages of imbibition and germination and studied the temporal expression profile of **MKRN** by RT-PCR.
   - The presence of **MKRN** transcripts in dry seeds, its early induction during germination and its continued spatiotemporal expression during early vegetative growth suggest that **MKRN** has an important role in germination, leaf and lateral root morphogenesis and overall development in rice.
   - This analysis revealed that **MKRN** transcripts were expressed in young plumules, lateral root primordia, leaf primordia, leaves and root tissues at many different stages of germination.
   - After 6days of germination, an organ-dependent expression pattern of **MKRN** was observed: highest in roots and moderate in leaves.
