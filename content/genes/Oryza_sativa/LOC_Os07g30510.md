## Functional Descriptions:
   - Under natural field conditions, the leaves of **LIL1** mutant plants exhibited light-induced, small, rust-red lesions that first appeared at the leaf tips and subsequently expanded throughout the entire leaf blade to the leaf sheath.
   - The **LIL1** mutants also displayed increased expression of defense-related genes and enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea).
   - Thus, **LIL1** is a novel LMM in rice that will facilitate the further study of the molecular mechanisms of HR and the rice blast resistance.
   - Histochemical staining indicated that **LIL1** lesions displayed an abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and resulted from programmed cell death (PCD).
   - Sequence analysis of these 12 candidate genes revealed a G to A base substitution in the fourth exon of LOC_Os07g30510, a putative cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase (CRK), which led to an amino acid change (Val 429 to Ile) in the **LIL1** protein.
   - Lesion mimic mutants (LMMs), such as **LIL1** that was identified in an ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenized population of Indica rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - Overexpression of the LOC_Os07g30510 gene from **LIL1** induced a **LIL1**-like lesion phenotype in Nipponbare.
   - A semi-dominant lesion mimic mutant **ALS1** (apoptosis leaf and sheath 1) in rice was identified to demonstrate spontaneous lesions on the leaf blade and sheath.
   - **ALS1** was expressed mainly in the leaf blade and sheath, in which further study revealed that **ALS1** was present in the vascular bundles.
   - Functional studies of **ALS1** were conducted, including phylogenetic analysis, expression analysis, subcellular location and blast resistance identification.
   - The mutation of **ALS1** caused a constitutively activated defence response in **ALS1**.
   - The results of our study imply that **ALS1** participate in a defence response resembling the common SA-, JA- and NH1- mediated defence responses in rice.
