## Functional Descriptions:
   - We found that the increased tillering phenotype of fine culm1 (**FC1**) mutants of rice is not rescued by the application of 1 microM GR24, a synthetic SL analog.
   - Treatment with a high concentration of GR24 (10 microM) causes suppression of tiller growth in wild-type plants, but is not effective on **FC1** mutants, implying that proper **FC1** functioning is required for SLs to inhibit bud growth.
   - Overexpression of **FC1** partially rescued d3-2 defects in the tiller growth and plant height.
   - An in situ hybridization analysis showed that **FC1** mRNA accumulates in axillary buds, the shoot apical meristem, young leaves, vascular tissues and the tips of crown roots.
   - We propose that **FC1** acts as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways and is essential to the fine-tuning of shoot branching in rice.
   - To understand the molecular mechanisms that control culm mechanical strength, we identified a flexible culm1 (**FC1**) mutant by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library.
   - In this study, we cloned the FLEXIBLE CULM1 (**FC1**) gene in rice using a T-DNA tagging approach.
   - Our results indicated that **FC1** plays an important role in the biosynthesis of lignin and the control of culm strength in rice.
   - On the other hand, the expression level of **FC1** is negatively regulated by cytokinin treatment.
   - FINE CULM1 (**FC1**) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice.
   - **FC1** encodes a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase and is mainly expressed in the sclerenchyma cells of the secondary cell wall and vascular bundle region.
   - In these types of cells, a deficiency of **FC1** in the **FC1** mutant caused a reduction in cell wall thickness, as well as a decrease in lignin.
   - Further histological and biochemical analyses revealed that the p-hydroxyphenyl and guaiacyl monomers in **FC1** cell wall were reduced greatly.
   - Extracts from the first internodes and panicles of the **FC1** plants exhibited drastically reduced cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase activity.
