## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice lectin protein **Osr40c1** imparts drought tolerance by modulating OsSAM2, OsSAP8 and chromatin-associated proteins.
   - In this study, it has been depicted that expression of **Osr40c1** gene correlates with the drought tolerance potential of various rice cultivars.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing **Osr40c1** were significantly more tolerant to drought stress over the wild-type plants.
   - Silencing of each of these protein partners led to drought sensitivity in the otherwise tolerant **Osr40c1** expressing transgenic tobacco lines indicating that these partners were crucial for the **Osr40c1**-mediated drought tolerance in planta.
   - Moreover, the association of **Osr40c1** with these partners occurred specifically under drought stress forming a multi-protein complex.
   - Together, the present investigation delineated the novel role of **Osr40c1** protein in imparting drought tolerance by regulating OsMNB1B, OsSAM2, and OsH4 proteins, which presumably enables OsSAP8 to induce downstream gene expression.
