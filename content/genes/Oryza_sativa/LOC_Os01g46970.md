## Functional Descriptions:
   - The current communication shows a comparative analysis performed on the binding of rice nuclear proteins, together with the purified transcription factor **OSBZ8**, to the cis-elements in the promoters of Rab16A (Motif I/Motif II), Osem (Motif A-1/Motif B) and Em (4X ABRE/2X ABRC).
   - Treatment of the seedlings with NaCl was found to enhance the complex formation, suggesting the regulation of **OSBZ8** gene at both transcriptional and post-translational steps.
   - RESULTS: Northern analysis of total RNA from roots and lamina of salt-sensitive M-I-48 and salt-tolerant Nonabokra, when probed with the N-terminal unique region of **OSBZ8** (**OSBZ8**p, without the highly conserved basic region), a transcript of 1.
   - The accumulation of **OSBZ8** mRNA was induced by treatment with ABA of imbibed mature rice embryos, of young plant tissues and of suspension-cultured cells.
   - The accumulation of **OSBZ8** mRNA in response to ABA preceded that of Osem and Rab16A mRNAs and was not inhibited by an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide.
   - These results strongly suggest that **OSBZ8** might be involved in the regulation of transcription by ABA in rice.
   - Trans-acting factor designated **OSBZ8** interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars.
   - In this report, we demonstrate that spermidine mediates in vitro phosphorylation of **OSBZ8**, a bZIP class of ABRE-binding transcription factor, by OSPDK.
   - Still, nothing is known about the expression of **OSBZ8** at protein level in vegetative tissue of salt sensitive and salt tolerant rice plants.
   - Therefore, **OSBZ8** was considered to play an important role in the regulation of transcription in the vegetative tissue of rice.
   - The aim of this study is to find out whether **OSBZ8** has any role in regulating the NaCl-stress induced gene expression in vegetative tissue and whether the expression of **OSBZ8** factor directly correlates with the stress tolerance of different varieties of indica type rice.
   - Comparative EMSA with different varieties of rice suggests a positive correlation with the expression pattern of **OSBZ8** and salt tolerance in rice cultivars.
   - An ABRE-binding factor, **OSBZ8**, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice.
   - We also show here that the activation and binding of **OSBZ8** to the upstream regions of salt-inducible genes depends on its phosphorylated state.
   - Comparative analysis of Histone modifications and DNA methylation at **OSBZ8** locus under salinity stress in IR64 and Nonabokra rice varieties.
   - Expression analysis indicates that the **OSBZ8** gene is highly induced in Nonabokra plants even in the absence of salt stress, whereas in IR64, the expression significantly increases only during salt stress.
   - Collectively these results indicate a significant difference in chromatin modifications between the rice varieties that regulates differential expression of **OSBZ8** gene during salt stress.
