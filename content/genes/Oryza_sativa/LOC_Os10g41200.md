## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MYBS3** is a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor previously shown to mediate sugar signaling in rice.
   - Transient expression assays with barley half-seeds showed that OsMYBS1 and OsMYBS2 transactivate a promoter containing the TATCCA element when sugar is provided, whereas **OsMYBS3** represses transcription of the same promoter under sugar starvation.
   - Transgenic rice constitutively overexpressing **MYBS3** tolerated 4 degrees C for at least 1 week and exhibited no yield penalty in normal field conditions.
   - Gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicated that **MYBS3** was sufficient and necessary for enhancing cold tolerance in rice.
   - A novel **MYBS3**-dependent pathway confers cold tolerance in rice.
   - Several genes activated by **MYBS3** as well as inducible by cold have previously been implicated in various abiotic stress responses and/or tolerance in rice and other plant species.
   - DREB1 responded quickly and transiently while **MYBS3** responded slowly to cold stress, which suggests that distinct pathways act sequentially and complementarily for adapting short- and long-term cold stress in rice.
