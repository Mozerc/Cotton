- **Gene Symbol:** SLES
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **SLES** phenotype differed from that of other LMMs in that lesion mimic spots were observed on the leaf sheath rather than on leaves.
   - Taken together, our results revealed that **SLES** was associated with the formation of lesion mimic spots on the leaf sheath resulting early senescence and defense responses.
   - Further examination of **SLES** will facilitate a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in ROS homeostasis and may also provide opportunities to improve pathogen resistance in rice.
