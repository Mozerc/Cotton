## Functional Descriptions:
   - Additionally, the **OsSBP** protein might have a role in modulating the defense mechanism to biotic stress in rice.
   - The rice Oryza sativa selenium-binding protein homologue (**OsSBP**) gene encodes a homologue of mammalian selenium-binding proteins, and it has been isolated as one of the genes induced by treating a plant with a cerebroside elicitor from rice blast fungus.
   - Plants overexpressing **OsSBP** showed enhanced resistance to a virulent strain of rice blast fungus as well as to rice bacterial blight.
   - The expression of defense-related genes and the accumulation of phytoalexin after infection by rice blast fungus were accelerated in the **OsSBP** overexpressors.
   - Enhanced Resistance to Blast Fungus and Bacterial Blight in Transgenic Rice Constitutively Expressing**OsSBP**, a Rice Homologue of Mammalian Selenium-binding Proteins.
   - The possible role of **OsSBP** in plant defense was evaluated by using a transgenic approach.
   - These results suggest that the upregulation of **OsSBP** expression conferred enhanced tolerance to different pathogens, possibly by increasing plant sensitivity to endogenous defense responses.
