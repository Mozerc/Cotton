- **Gene Symbol:** OsBC1L4
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in **OsBC1L4** mutants by measuring the content of wall components.
   - Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of **OsBC1L4** was highly correlated to that of several primary wall-forming cellulose synthase genes (CESAs).
   - Moreover, the expression level of several cellulose-related genes is increased in **OsBC1L4** mutants, which suggests that a feedback mechanism may exist during cellulose synthesis.
   - **OsBC1L4** encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice.
   - Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, **OsBC1L4** (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library.
   - **OsBC1L4** protein is mainly located in the cell wall and plasma membrane.
