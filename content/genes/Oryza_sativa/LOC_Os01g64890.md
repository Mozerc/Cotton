## Functional Descriptions:
   - Up-regulation of a magnesium transporter gene **OsMGT1** is required for conferring aluminum tolerance in rice.
   - When a putative rice (Oryza sativa) Mg transporter gene, Oryza sativa MAGNESIUM TRANSPORTER1 (**OsMGT1**), was knocked out, the tolerance to Al, but not to cadmium and lanthanum, was decreased.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **OsMGT1** is a transporter for Mg uptake in the roots and that up-regulation of this gene is required for conferring Al tolerance in rice by increasing Mg concentration in the cell.
   - **OsMGT1** was expressed in both the roots and shoots in the absence of Al, but the expression only in the roots was rapidly up-regulated by Al.
   - **OsMGT1** was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade and sheath.
   - Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter **OsMGT1** is required for the salt-tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na+ from the xylem sap at the root mature zone.
   - Knockout of **OsMGT1** did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg2+ concentration (20-200 Î¼M).
   - Spatial expression analysis revealed that **OsMGT1** was expressed in all root cells of the root tips, but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that Mg2+ transported by **OsMGT1** in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.
   - A magnesium transporter **OsMGT1** plays a critical role in salt tolerance in rice.
   - **OsMGT1** was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress.
   - Furthermore, knockout of OsHKT1;5 in **OsMGT1** mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity.
   - Investigation of tissue expression patterns revealed that **OsMGT1** was mainly expressed in the phloem region; however, Mg deficiency remarkably enhanced its expression in xylem parenchyma and mesophyll cells in shoots.
   - **OsMGT1** Confers Resistance to Magnesium Deficiency By Enhancing the Import of Mg in Rice.
   - In this study, we identified a Mg transporter gene **OsMGT1** that confers resistance to Mg deficiency in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - In conclusion, our results indicate that **OsMGT1** plays an important role in rice Mg import and is required for the resistance to Mg deficiency, which can be utilized for molecular breeding of low-Mg tolerant plants.
   - Knockout of **OsMGT1** resulted in a significant reduction in Mg content and biomass when grown at Mg-limited conditions.
   - In addition, overexpression of **OsMGT1** increased Mg content and biomass under low-Mg supply.
