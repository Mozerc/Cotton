## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g01620](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g01620)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0105900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0105900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DNL-4</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **DNL-4** mutant showed reduced plant height and leaf blade width compared to the wild type, and increased leaf inclination.
   - These results suggest that **DNL-4** expression is involved in modulating plant height and leaf growth.
   - To understand **DNL-4** function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the **DNL-4** mutant.
   - The observation that **DNL-4** expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the **DNL-4** mutant.
   - These results suggest that **DNL-4** regulates plant height and leaf structure in rice.
   - Furthermore, **DNL-4** expression also affects productivity in rice: the **DNL-4** mutant exhibited reduced panicle length and grain width compared with the wild type.
   - The morphological defects of the mutant were caused by the suppressed expression of the **DNL-4** gene, which encodes a pfkB carbohydrate kinase protein.
