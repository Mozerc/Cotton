## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results suggest that **SAPK1** and SAPK2 may function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance at the germination and seedling stages.
   - **SAPK1** and SAPK2 may function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance at the germination and seedling stages in rice.
   - The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases **SAPK1** and SAPK2 function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.
   - We also found that **SAPK1** and SAPK2 affected the osmotic potential following salt stress by promoting the generation of osmotically active metabolites such as proline.
   - **SAPK1** and SAPK2 also improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification following salt stress by promoting the generation of ROS scavengers such as ascorbic acid, and by increasing the expression levels of proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT).
   - **SAPK1** and SAPK2 may be useful to improve salt tolerance in crop plants.
   - Expression profiling revealed that **SAPK1** and SAPK2 expression were strongly induced by drought, NaCl, and PEG treatment, but not by ABA.
