## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using subtractive hybridization a submergence-induced gene was identified from deepwater rice, **OsUsp1**, that encodes a homologue of the bacterial universal stress protein family.
   - In the youngest internode of deepwater rice plants, **OsUsp1** expression was very strongly induced within 1 h of submergence.
   - Based on sequence information and on expression data it is hypothesized that **OsUsp1** plays a role in ethylene-mediated stress adaptation in rice.
   - The novel ethylene-regulated gene **OsUsp1** from rice encodes a member of a plant protein family related to prokaryotic universal stress proteins.
