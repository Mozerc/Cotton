- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0205000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0205000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** SPL35
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SPL35** exhibited decreased chlorophyll content, higher accumulation of H2 O2 , up-regulated expression of defence-related marker genes, and enhanced resistance to both fungal and bacterial pathogens of rice.
   - **SPL35** directly interacts with the E2 protein OsUBC5a and the coatomer subunit delta proteins Delta-COP1 and Delta-COP2 through the CUE domain, and down-regulation of these interacting proteins also cause development of HR-like lesions resembling those in **SPL35** and activation of defence responses, indicating that **SPL35** may be involved in the ubiquitination and vesicular trafficking pathways.
   - Our findings provide insight into a role of **SPL35** in regulating cell death and defence response in plants.
   - The **SPL35** gene encodes a novel CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation) domain-containing protein that is predominantly localized in cytosol, ER and unknown punctate compartment(s).
   - **SPL35** is constitutively expressed in all organs, and both overexpression and knockdown of **SPL35** cause the lesion mimic phenotype.
