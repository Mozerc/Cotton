- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results suggest that leaf variegation in the **Z3** mutant is caused by an unbalanced accumulation of citrate in a transverse pattern in the leaves.
   - Taking these results together, we propose that **Z3** plays an important role in citrate transport and distribution during leaf development and is a possible candidate for a CitMHS family member in plants.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the **Z3** locus encodes a putative citrate transporter that belongs to the citrate-metal hydrogen symport (CitMHS) family.
   - To investigate whether **Z3** acts as a citrate transporter in rice, we measured citrate levels in wild-type leaves and in the dark-green and green sectors of the leaves of **Z3** mutants.
