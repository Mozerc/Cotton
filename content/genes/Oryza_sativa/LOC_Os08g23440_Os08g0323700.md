## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os08g23440](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os08g23440)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0323700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0323700)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsCCC1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Results from different tests indicated that the **OsCCC1** plays a significant role in K+ and Cl- homeostasis and rice plant development.
   - sativa cDNA, which was named **OsCCC1**, can be induced by KCl in the shoot and root and that the expression level was higher in the leaf and root tips than in any other part of the rice plant.
   - Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene **OsCCC1**.
   - **OsCCC1** was expressed in all cells of the roots, leaf and basal node.
   - The expression of **OsCCC1** was found in both the roots and shoots although higher expression was found in the root tips.
   - Introduction of **OsCCC1** cDNA into the mutant rescued the mutant growth, indicating that growth defect of both the roots and shoots are caused by loss of function of **OsCCC1**.
   - These results suggest that **OsCCC1** is involved in the cell elongation by regulating ion homeostasis to maintain cellular osmotic potential.
   - Immunoblot analysis revealed that **OsCCC1** was mainly localized to the plasma membrane.
