## Functional Descriptions:
   - A guanine insert in **OsBBS1** leads to early leaf senescence and salt stress sensitivity in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - Transgenic LOC_Os03g24930 knockout plants generated by a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy exhibited similar early leaf senescence phenotypes as did the bbs1 mutant, which confirmed that LOC_Os03g24930 was the **OsBBS1** gene.
   - The **OsBBS1** gene was cloned by a map-based cloning strategy, and a guanine (G) insertion was found in the first exon of LOC_Os03g24930.
   - The expression of **OsBBS1** could be greatly induced by salt stress, and the bbs1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to salt stress.
   - Chloroplast degradation was observed in **LMM24** leaves, with decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes and increased expression of the senescence-induced STAYGREEN (SGR) gene and other senescence-associated genes.
   - The **LMM24** mutant displayed dark brown lesions in leaves and growth retardation that were not observed in wild-type ZH8015.
   - Furthermore, **LMM24** exhibited enhanced resistance to rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (M.
   - **LMM24** Encodes Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase 109, Which Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses in Rice..
   - Our data demonstrate that **LMM24** regulates cell death and defense responses in rice.
   - The results of histochemical staining and TUNEL assays showed enhanced ROS accumulation and cell death in **LMM24**.
   - The **LMM24** gene was identified by MutMap, and **LMM24** was confirmed as a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase 109 by amino acid sequence analysis.
   - We identified a new rice lesion mimic mutant **LMM24** from a mutant pool of indica rice cultivar &quot;ZhongHui8015&quot;.
