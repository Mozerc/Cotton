## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g37970](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g37970)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0576700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0576700)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsiBBC1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Northern analysis showed that **OsiBBC1** is expressed more in the young root, post-fertilized influorescence, leaf base and callus tissue, which are comprised of actively dividing cells, indicating its role in cell division.
   - The **OsiBBC1** transcript accumulated more in the root of light-grown seedlings as compared to the shoot while its levels were higher in the shoot as compared to root of the etiolated seedlings, indicating its down-regulation by light.
