## Functional Descriptions:
   - In concomitant tests of all OsPIPs, four genes (OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;1, **OsPIP2;2**, and OsPIP2;4) were induced to express in leaves of rice plants following a physiological drought stress, while **OsPIP2;2** was expressed to the highest level.
   - In rice protoplasts, H2O transport and drought-tolerant responses, which included expression of marker genes of drought tolerance pathway, were considerably enhanced by **OsPIP2;2** overexpression but strongly inhibited by the gene silencing.
   - Furthermore, **OsPIP2;2** played a role in maintenance of the cell membrane integrity and effectively protected rice cells from electrolyte leakage caused by the physiological drought stress.
   - These results suggest that **OsPIP2;2** is a predominant facilitator of H2O transport in relevance to drought tolerance in the plant.
   - After de novo expression in tobacco protoplasts, **OsPIP2;2** exceeded OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;1, and OsPIP2;4 to support H2O transport across the plasma membranes.
