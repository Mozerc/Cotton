## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we identified a rice Cd transporter, **OsLCT1**, involved in Cd transport to the grains.
   - Low-affinity cation transporter (**OsLCT1**) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains.
   - The knockdown plants of **OsLCT1** accumulated approximately half as much Cd in the grains as did the control plants.
   - The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by **OsLCT1** suppression.
   - These results suggest that **OsLCT1** functions at the nodes in Cd transport into grains and that in a standard japonica cultivar, the regulation of **OsLCT1** enables the generation of low-Cd rice without negative effects on agronomical traits.
   - In rice plants, strong **OsLCT1** expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage.
   - RNAi-mediated knockdown of **OsLCT1** did not affect xylem-mediated Cd transport but reduced phloem-mediated Cd transport.
   - In the uppermost node, **OsLCT1** transcripts were detected around large vascular bundles and in diffuse vascular bundles.
   - The OsHMA2, **OsLCT1** and OsZIP3 transporters were all involved in zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) transport.
   - Furthermore, the expression of the Cd transporter genes, OsHMA2, OsHMA3 and **OsLCT1** were curtailed in NPs-treated rice plants under normal and drought stress conditions.
