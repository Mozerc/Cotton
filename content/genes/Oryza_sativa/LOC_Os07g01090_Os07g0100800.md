## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g01090](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g01090)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0100800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0100800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsProT3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - qRT-PCR analyses suggested that OsProT1 was preferentially expressed in leaf sheathes during vegetative growth, while **OsProT3** exhibited relatively high expression levels in several tissues, including nodes, panicles and roots.
   - Interestingly, both OsProT1 and **OsProT3** were induced by cadmium stress in rice shoots.
   - Our results suggested that plasma membrane-localized OsProT1 and **OsProT3** efficiently transport Pro and GABA when ectopically expressed in yeast and appear to be involved in various physiological processes, including adaption to cadmium stress in rice plants.
   - Transient expression of eGFP-OsProTs in plant protoplasts revealed that both OsProT1 and **OsProT3** are localized to the plasma membrane.
   - OsProT1 and **OsProT3** Function to Mediate Proline- and γ-aminobutyric acid-specific Transport in Yeast and are Differentially Expressed in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
