## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsGEN-L**-RNAi plants lacked mature pollen, resulting from a defect in early microspore development.
   - Our results suggest that **OsGEN-L** plays an essential role in DNA metabolism required for early microspore development in rice.
   - RNAi-mediated silencing of **OsGEN-L** (**OsGEN-L**ike), a new member of the RAD2/XPG nuclease family, causes male sterility by defect of microspore development in rice.
   - Most of the **OsGEN-L**-RNAi plants displayed low fertility, and some of them were male-sterile.
   - **OsGEN-L** has a 5'-flap endonuclease activity and plays an essential role in rice microspore development.
   - A **OsGEN-L**-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in the nucleus, and the **OsGEN-L** promoter was specifically active in the anthers.
   - In contrast, depletion of OsSEND1 had no effects on plant development and did not enhance **OsGEN1** defects.
   - We first investigated the role of **OsGEN1** during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ~6% in **OsGEN1** mutants, compared to wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of **OsGEN1** in the formation of crossovers.
   - Post-meiosis, **OsGEN1** foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the **OsGEN1** mutant concomitant with an increase in double strand breaks.
