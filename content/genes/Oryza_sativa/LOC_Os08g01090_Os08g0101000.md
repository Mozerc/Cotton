## Functional Descriptions:
   - The transcription factor **IDEF1** regulates the response to Fe deficiency in Oryza sativa (rice) by recognizing CATGC sequences within the Fe deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1.
   - The rice transcription factor **IDEF1** is essential for the early response to iron deficiency, and induces vegetative expression of late embryogenesis abundant genes.
   - Transgenic rice plants expressing an introduced **IDEF1** exhibit substantial tolerance to iron deficiency in both hydroponic culture and calcareous soil.
   - During seed germination, **IDEF1** and IDEF2 were expressed in the endosperm and embryo.
   - We identified the rice transcription factor **IDEF1**, which specifically binds the iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element IDE1.
   - **IDEF1** belongs to an uncharacterized branch of the plant-specific transcription factor family ABI3/VP1 and exhibits the sequence recognition property of efficiently binding to the CATGC sequence within IDE1.
   - **IDEF1** overexpression leads to the enhanced expression of the iron deficiency-induced transcription factor gene OsIRO2, suggesting the presence of a sequential gene regulatory network.
   - The transcription factor **IDEF1** regulates the response to and tolerance of iron deficiency in plants.
   - The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors **IDEF1** and IDEF2.
   - Proximal regions of **IDEF1**-regulated gene promoters also showed enrichment of RY elements (CATGCA), which regulate gene expression during seed maturation.
   - The expression of several genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant proteins, including Osem, was induced in Fe-deficient roots and/or leaves in an **IDEF1**-dependent manner, suggesting a possible function of seed maturation-related genes in Fe-deficient vegetative organs.
   - CONCLUSIONS: **IDEF1** and IDEF2 are constitutively expressed during both vegetative and reproductive stages.
   - **IDEF1** and IDEF2 expression was dominant in leaf mesophyll and vascular cells, respectively.
   - KEY RESULTS: **IDEF1** and IDEF2 were highly expressed in the basal parts of the lateral roots and vascular bundles.
   - The Oryza sativa (rice) transcription factor **IDEF1** plays a crucial role in regulating iron deficiency-induced genes involved in iron homeostasis.
   - Transgenic rice plants constitutively overexpressing **IDEF1** without these metal-binding domains failed to cause pleiotropic effects conferred by overexpression of full-length **IDEF1**, including a low germination rate, impaired seedling growth, tolerance to iron deficiency in hydroponic culture, and enhanced expression of various iron deficiency-inducible genes.
   - Impairment of the transcriptional regulation of **IDEF1** by deletion of the metal-binding domains occurred primarily at an early stage of iron deficiency.
   - These results suggest that the histidine-asparagine and proline-rich regions in rice **IDEF1** directly bind to divalent metals and sense the cellular metal ion balance caused by changes in iron availability.
   - The rice transcription factor **IDEF1** directly binds to iron and other divalent metals for sensing cellular iron status.
   - **IDEF1** was strongly expressed in pollen, ovaries, the aleurone layer and embryo.
   - The iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element binding factors 1 and 2 (**IDEF1** and IDEF2) regulate transcriptional response to iron deficiency in rice roots.
   - Expression patterns of the target genes of **IDEF1** and IDEF2 were analysed using transformants with induced or repressed expression of **IDEF1** or IDEF2 grown in iron-rich or in iron-deficient solutions for 1 d.
   - Expression of **IDEF1** target genes was regulated in iron-rich roots similar to early iron-deficiency stages.
   - The spatial expression patterns and gene regulation of **IDEF1** and IDEF2 in roots are generally conserved under conditions of iron sufficiency and deficiency, suggesting complicated interactions with unknown factors for sensing and transmitting iron-deficiency signals.
   - Manipulation of **IDEF1** also provides another approach for producing crops tolerant of iron deficiency to enhance food and biomass production in calcareous soils.
   - **IDEF1** transcripts are constitutively present in rice roots and leaves.
   - Transgenic tobacco plants expressing **IDEF1** under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter transactivate IDE1-mediated expression only in iron-deficient roots.
   - Many jasmonate-inducible genes were also negatively regulated by the ubiquitin ligases OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 and positively regulated by the transcription factor **IDEF1**.
   - These results indicate that jasmonate signaling is activated during the very early stages of iron deficiency, which is partly regulated by **IDEF1** and OsHRZs.
