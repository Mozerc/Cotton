## Functional Descriptions:
   - The transcription factor **OsWRKY28** acts as a negative regulator of basal resistance, like the orthologous barley gene.
   - In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the role of one of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice, **OsWRKY28**, in the regulation of basal defense responses to a compatible race of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, strain Ina86-137.
   - Finally, transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction of several defense-related genes in the wild type after Ina86-137 infection was counteracted in **OsWRKY28**-overexpressing rice plants.
   - These results strongly suggest that **OsWRKY28** is a negative regulator of basal defense responses against Ina86-137 and acts as a modulator to maintain the responses at an appropriate level by attenuating the activation of defense-related gene expression levels.
   - The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that **OsWRKY28**, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76.
   - Here, we report that a large inverted repeat construct designed to knock down the expression of the four OsWRKY IIa subfamily members (OsWRKY62, **OsWRKY28**, OsWRKY71, and OsWRKY76) leads to overexpression of all four genes and disease resistance in some transgenic plants.
   - **OsWRKY28**, a PAMP-responsive transrepressor, negatively regulates innate immune responses in rice against rice blast fungus.
   - **OsWRKY28** Regulates Phosphate and Arsenate Accumulation, Root System Architecture and Fertility in Rice..
   - Exogenous JA treatments mimicked the phenotypes of the **OsWRKY28** mutants with inhibited root elongation and decreased arsenate/phosphate translocation.
   - Our results suggested that **OsWRKY28** affected arsenate/phosphate accumulation, root development at the seedling stage and fertility at the reproductive stage possibly by influencing homeostasis of JA or other phytohormones.
   - The expression of **OsWRKY28** was markedly induced by arsenate and other oxidative stresses.
   - In a hydroponic experiment, loss-of-function mutation in **OsWRKY28** resulted in lower accumulation of arsenate and phosphate concentration in the shoots.
   - In this study, we explored the functions of a transcription factor **OsWRKY28** in rice.
   - The **OsWRKY28** overexpression lines showed enhanced salinity stress tolerance, whereas the **OsWRKY28** mutants displayed salt sensitivity compared to wild-type plants.
   - Under salt stress treatment, the expression levels of OsbZIP05, OsHKT1;1 and OsDREB1B were significantly lower yet the level of OsHKT2;1 was significantly higher in **OsWRKY28** mutants than those in wide type plants.
   - **OsWRKY28** confers salinity tolerance by directly binding to OsDREB1B promoter and increasing its transcriptional activity, and negatively regulates abscisic acid mediated seedling establishment in rice.
   - **OsWRKY28** positively regulates salinity tolerance by directly activating OsDREB1B expression in rice..
   - Our data of yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase assay supported that **OsWRKY28** could directly bind to the promoter of OsDREB1B to enhance salinity tolerance in rice.
   - Together, **OsWRKY28** confers salinity tolerance through directly targeting OsDREB1B promoter and further activating its transcription in rice.
   - The transcript level of **OsWRKY28** was strikingly increased under drought, chilling, salt and abscisic acid treatments.
   - In addition, **OsWRKY28** overexpression lines displayed hyposensitivity and the **OsWRKY28** mutants showed hypersensitivity compared to wild-type plants under exogenous abscisic acid treatment.
