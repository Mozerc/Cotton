## Functional Descriptions:
   - Of these genes, a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, named **OsIRO2**, was strongly expressed in both roots and shoots during Fe deficiency stress.
   - **OsIRO2** expression in vegetative tissues was restricted almost exclusively to vascular bundles of roots and leaves, and to the root exodermis under Fe-sufficient conditions, and expanded to all tissues of roots and leaves in response to Fe deficiency.
   - Microarray analysis demonstrated that **OsIRO2** regulates 59 Fe-deficiency-induced genes in roots.
   - Gene expression analysis of rice iron-regulated bHLH transcription factor **OsIRO2**, nicotianamine synthases 1 and 2 (NAS1 and NAS2), yellow-stripe like transporter 15 (YSL15) and iron-regulated transporter (IRT1) indicated that ethylene caused an increase in transcript abundance of both Fe (II) and Fe (III)-phytosiderophore uptake systems.
   - RNA interference of **OsIRO2** in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15, and OsIRT1.
   - To elucidate the regulation mechanisms of the genes related to Fe acquisition in graminaceous plants, we characterized the Fe-deficiency-inducible basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor **OsIRO2** in rice.
   - Some of these genes, including two transcription factors upregulated by Fe deficiency, possessed the **OsIRO2** binding sequence in their upstream regions.
   - We propose a novel gene regulation network for Fe-deficiency responses, including **OsIRO2**, IDEs and the two transcription factors.
   - Previously, we reported that an Fe-deficiency-inducible basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, **OsIRO2**, is responsible for regulation of the genes involved in Fe homeostasis in rice.
   - Plants overexpressing **OsIRO2** grew better, and **OsIRO2**-repressed plants showed poor growth compared to non-transformant rice after germination.
   - **OsIRO2** is responsible for iron utilization in rice and improves growth and yield in calcareous soil.
   - These results suggest that **OsIRO2** is synchronously expressed with genes involved in Fe homeostasis, and performs a crucial function in regulation not only of Fe uptake from soil but also Fe transport during germination and Fe translocation to grain during seed maturation.
   - **OsIRO2** expression was also detected in flowers and developing seeds.
   - In this study, we produced a new Fe deficiency-tolerant rice by the additional introduction of a barley IDS3 genome fragment with refre1/372 and **OsIRO2** (named as IRI lines) for further enhancement in Strategy II phytosiderophore productivity and better growth performance in various environments.
   - Our results show that an enhanced tolerance was observed in **OsIRO2** introduced line at the early growth stage, refre1/372 introduced line in the late stage, and RI line in all stages among five types of cultivation method.
   - Enhancement of Iron Acquisition in Rice by the Mugineic Acid Synthase Gene With Ferric Iron Reductase Gene and **OsIRO2** Confers Tolerance in Submerged and Nonsubmerged Calcareous Soils.
   - Moreover, we demonstrated that new IRI rice lines exhibited enhanced tolerance to Fe deficiency compared to nontransgenic (NT) rice and rice lines harboring the overexpressing **OsIRO2** or the IDS3 fragment under submerged calcareous soil.
   - OsIRO3 negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of **OsIRO2**.
