- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Lsi6</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Lsi6** is expressed in the leaf sheath and leaf blades as well as in the root tips.
   - Knockdown of **Lsi6** did not affect the uptake of Si by the roots but resulted in disordered deposition of silica in the shoots and increased excretion of Si in the guttation fluid.
   - **Lsi6** is a silicon transporter in rice (Oryza sativa), and its expression in node I below the panicles is greatly enhanced when the panicle is completely emerged.
   - Knockout of **Lsi6** decreased Si accumulation in the panicles but increased Si accumulation in the flag leaf.
   - **Lsi6** is mainly localized at the xylem transfer cells located at the outer boundary region of the enlarged large vascular bundles in node I.
   - Herein, we report on a transporter (**Lsi6**) responsible for the redirection of a plant nutrient at the node.
   - These results suggest that **Lsi6** is a transporter involved in intervascular transfer (i.
   - Cellular localization studies revealed that **Lsi6** is found in the xylem parenchyma cells of the leaf sheath and leaf blades.
   - These results indicate that **Lsi6** is a transporter responsible for the transport of Si out of the xylem and subsequently affects the distribution of Si in the leaf.
   - Here, we describe a transporter, **Lsi6**, which is involved in the distribution of Si in the shoots.
