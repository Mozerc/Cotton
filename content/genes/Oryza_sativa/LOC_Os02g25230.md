- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TAC4** can regulate rice shoot gravitropism by increasing the indole acetic acid content and affecting the auxin distribution.
   - **TAC4** controls tiller angle by regulating the endogenous auxin content and distribution in rice.
   - The loss of **TAC4** function leads to a significant increase in the tiller angle.
   - A sequence analysis revealed that **TAC4** has undergone a bottleneck and become fixed in indica cultivars during domestication and improvement.
   - **TAC4** encodes a plant-specific, highly conserved nuclear protein.
   - We further found that BRs enhance the accumulation of **SG2** in the nucleus, and subcellular distribution of **SG2** is regulated by GSK2 kinase activity.
   - The decreased grain size was caused by repressed cell expansion in spikelet hulls of the **SG2** mutant.
   - In addition, OsOFP19, a negative regulator of grain shape, interacts with **SG2** and plays an antagonistic role with **SG2** in controlling gene expression and grain size.
   - Our results indicated that **SG2** is a new component of GSK2-related BR signaling response and regulates grain size by interacting with OsOFP19.
   - **SG2** is a positive regulator downstream of GSK2 in response to BR signaling, and its mutation causes insensitivity to exogenous BR treatment.
   - According to LC-MS/MS analysis of intermediate products of the lignin synthesis pathway, the accumulation of caffeyl alcohol in the **OsBC17** mutant was significantly higher than in Pingtangheinuo.
   - Caffeyl alcohol can be polymerized to the catechyl lignin monomer by laccase ChLAC8; however, ChLAC8 and **OsBC17** are not homologous proteins, which suggests that the **OsBC17** gene is involved in this process by regulating laccase expression.
