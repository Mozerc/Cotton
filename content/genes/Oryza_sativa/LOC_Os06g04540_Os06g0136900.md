- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **DP1** enhancer S**DP1** was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor.
   - We identified the **DP1** gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development.
   - The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in **DP1** mutants.
   - Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1 (S**DP1**), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size.
   - In addition, we found a floral organ number increase in **DP1** mutants at low penetration.
   - E function and presumable A function floral homeotic genes were found suppressed in the **DP1**-2 mutant.
   - The depressed palea1 (**DP1**) mutants show a primary defect in the main structure of palea, implying that palea is a fusion between the main structure and marginal tissues on both sides.
   - **DP1** is an AT-hook protein while REP1 is a TCP transcription factor, both of which are important regulators of palea development.
