## Functional Descriptions:
   - OsBRI1 activates BR signaling by preventing binding between the TPR and kinase domains of **OsBSK3** via phosphorylation.
   - Genetic studies revealed that **OsBSK3** is a positive regulator of BR signaling in rice, while in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that OsBRI1 interacts directly with and phosphorylates **OsBSK3**.
   - Our results not only demonstrate that **OsBSK3** plays a conserved role in regulating BR signaling in rice, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which BSK family proteins are inhibited under basal conditions but switched on by the upstream receptor kinase BRI1.
   - The TPR domain of **OsBSK3**, which interacts directly with the protein's kinase domain, serves as an autoinhibitory domain to prevent **OsBSK3** from interacting with BSU1.
   - Phosphorylation of **OsBSK3** by OsBRI1 disrupts the interaction between its TPR and kinase domains, thereby increasing the binding between **OsBSK3**'s kinase domain and BSU1.
   - **OsBSK3** Positively Regulates Grain Length and Weight by Inhibiting the Phosphatase Activity of OsPPKL1.
   - In addition, the genetic evidence showed **OsBSK3** acts upstream of OsPPKL1 in regulating grain length and weight.
   - Contrary to the well-established BR signaling pathway in Arabidopsis, there are significant gaps in the rice BR signaling pathway, especially the regulation mechanism from **OsBSK3** to OsPPKLs and OsGSKs.
   - In this study, we report how **OsBSK3** knockout mutants confer shorter and lighter grains and exhibit a typical BR-insensitive phenotype, suggesting **OsBSK3** plays a positive role in BR signaling without genetic redundancy with homologs.
   - Furthermore, **OsBSK3** could physically interact with OsPPKL1 and OsGSK3, the downstream components in BR signaling, as a scaffold protein, and inhibit the phosphatase activity of OsPPKL1 on the dephosphorylation of OsGSK3.
