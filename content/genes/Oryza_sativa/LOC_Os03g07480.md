## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsSUT1** encodes a rice sucrose transport protein that is highly expressed in developing grain, leaf sheath and stem after heading, and in germinating seedlings, but only at very low levels in source leaves.
   - However, starch accumulation during pollen development was not affected by disruption of **OsSUT1**, suggesting that the sugar(s) required for starch biosynthesis is supplied by other sugar transporters.
   - Disruption of a gene for rice sucrose transporter, **OsSUT1**, impairs pollen function but pollen maturation is unaffected.
   - Wide-field fluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the expression of **OsSUT1**-promoter::GUS reporter gene in vascular parenchyma associated with xylem elements, as well as in companion cells associated with phloem sieve tubes of large, intermediate and small vascular bundles within the leaf blade, in regions where the aphids had settled and were feeding.
   - Rice sucrose transporter1 (**OsSUT1**) up-regulation in xylem parenchyma is caused by aphid feeding on rice leaf blade vascular bundles.
   - The roles of the rice sucrose transporter, **OsSUT1**, have previously been examined in filling grain, germination, and early seedling growth.
   - Involvement of the sucrose transporter, **OsSUT1**, in the long-distance pathway for assimilate transport in rice.
   - Using expression analysis, the role of the sucrose transporter **OsSUT1** during germination and early growth of rice seedlings has been examined in detail, over a time-course ranging from 1 d to 7 d post-imbibition.
   - The role of the sucrose transporter, **OsSUT1**, in germination and early seedling growth and development of rice plants.
   - **OsSUT1** was also present in the coleoptile and the first and second leaf blades, where it was localized to the phloem along the entire length of these tissues, and was also present within the phloem of the primary roots.
   - Furthermore, seed from some of the T0 population showed a reduction in the rate of germination and growth, supporting the hypothesis that **OsSUT1** may also play a role in transporting sucrose remobilized from starch reserves in germinating seeds.
   - From 14 to 21 days after heading, the expression of the sucrose transporter gene, **OsSUT1**, was higher in the stem of 'Genkitsukushi' grown under high temperature than in 'Tsukushiroman'.
   - In addition, the expression of **OsSUT1** in the grains of 'Genkitsukushi' was significantly higher than in 'Tsukushiroman' during the ripening period.
   - However, by 3 d post-imbibition, **OsSUT1** was present in the companion cells and sieve elements of the scutellar vascular bundle, where it may play a role in phloem loading of sucrose for transport to the developing shoot and roots.
   - There was no difference between antisense and wild-type plants in carbohydrate content and photosynthetic ability of the flag leaves in the vegetative growth stage, suggesting that **OsSUT1** may not play an important role in carbon metabolism, at least in these materials.
   - Six conserved, charged amino acids within membrane spans in rice sucrose transporter **OsSUT1** were identified using a three-dimensional structural model based on the crystal structures of three major facilitator superfamily (MFS) proteins: LacY, GlpT, and EmrD.
   - Functionally important amino acids in rice sucrose transporter **OsSUT1**.
   - Antisense suppression of the rice transporter gene, **OsSUT1**, leads to impaired grain filling and germination but does not affect photosynthesis.
   - In the current work, the role that **OsSUT1** plays in the transport of assimilate along the entire long-distance pathway, from the flag leaf blade to the base of the filling grain, was investigated.
   - **OsSUT1** promoter::GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene analysis and immunolocalization revealed that both **OsSUT1** promoter::GUS activity and OsSUT protein were present in the mature phloem of all the vegetative tissues involved in the long-distance assimilate transport pathway during grain filling.
   - The rice sucrose transporter**OsSUT1** and the monosaccharide transportersOsMST1-3 have been previously characterized.
   - 4 percnt; identity to that of**OsSUT1**and barley transporterHvSUT1, respectively.
   - We analyzed the function of a rice sucrose transporter, **OsSUT1**, by using antisense rice.
   - Antisense Expression of a Rice Sucrose Transporter **OsSUT1** in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - Transport activity of rice sucrose transporters **OsSUT1** and OsSUT5.
   - Unlike the wheat orthologue, TaSUT1, which is thought to be directly involved in sugar transfer across the scutellar epithelium, **OsSUT1** is not expressed in the scutellar epithelial cell layer of germinating rice and is, therefore, not involved in transport of sugars across the symplastic discontinuity between the endosperm and the embryo.
   - Arg188 in rice sucrose transporter **OsSUT1** is crucial for substrate transport.
   - Assimilate translocation and expression of sucrose transporter, **OsSUT1**, contribute to high-performance ripening under heat stress in the heat-tolerant rice cultivar Genkitsukushi.
   - Expression of **OsSUT1** in pollen was confirmed by a promoter-GUS fusion assay.
   - The physiological function of **OsSUT1** in pollen was further investigated using retrotransposon insertion mutant lines.
   - Their progeny segregated into SUT1+/- and SUT1+/+ with the ratio of 1:1, suggesting that the pollen disrupted for **OsSUT1** is dysfunctional.
   - The role of the sucrose transporter **OsSUT1** in assimilate retrieval via the xylem, as a result of damage to and leakage from punctured phloem was examined after rusty plum aphid (Hysteroneura setariae, Thomas) infestation on leaves from 3-week-old rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - This hypothesis was tested using antisense lines of the salt responsive **OsSUT1** gene in the salt sensitive Taipei 309 cultivar.
   - Two independent **OsSUT1** lines with an antisense inhibition similar to the naturally occurring salt induced reduction of **OsSUT1** gene expression showed these phenomena but not a more extreme antisense inhibition line.
   - Modification of **OsSUT1** gene expression modulates the salt response of rice Oryza sativa cv. Taipei 309.
   - On the other hand**OsSUT1** was expressed at the early stage of the grain development, suggesting a different physiological role compared to Os SUT2.
   - While the homozygote of disrupted **OsSUT1** (SUT1-/-) could not be obtained, heterozygote plants (SUT1+/-) showed normal grain filling.
   - Severe phenotypes correlated with a reduction in **OsSUT1** transcript level in filling grain.
   - Of great interest was up-regulation of **OsSUT1** expression associated with the xylem parenchyma cells, abutting the metaxylem vessels, which confirmed that **OsSUT1** was not only involved in loading of sugars into the phloem under normal physiological conditions, but was apparently involved in the retrieval of sucrose leaked into the xylem conduits, which occurred as a direct result of aphid feeding, probing and puncturing of vascular bundles.
   - The up-regulation of **OsSUT1** in xylem vascular parenchyma thus provides evidence in support of the location within the xylem parenchyma cells of an efficient mechanism to ensure sucrose recovery after loss to the apoplast (xylem) after aphid-related feeding damage and its transfer back to the symplast (phloem) in O.
   - Moreover, the expression level of **OsSUT1** was much higher than that of other plasma membrane localized OsSUTs in the source leaf.
   - The **OsSUT1** and ossut4 mutants presented a decrease of grain yield, implying important roles of OsSUTs in phloem loading.
   - Cross sections of the GUS transgenic plant showed that the signals of **OsSUT1** and OsSUT5 occurred in the phloem companion cells.
   - Observation of caryopsis development revealed that the endosperm of **OsSUT1** mutants failed to cellularize and did not show any sign of seed-filling.
   - These results indicate that **OsSUT1** is indispensable during the rice reproductive stage particularly for caryopsis development.
   - Consistently, **OsSUT1** was identified to express strongly in developing caryopsis of wild-type rice, particularly in the nucellar epidermis and aleurone which are critical for the uptake of nutrients into the endosperm.
   - Knockout of Nhd1 suppressed **OsSUT1** expression, and both nhd1 and **OsSUT1** mutants showed similar shorter height, and lower shoot biomass and sucrose concentration in comparison with the wild type, while overexpression of **OsSUT1** can restore the defective sucrose transport and partially ameliorate the reduced growth of nhd1 mutants.
   - Rice circadian clock regulator Nhd1 controls the expression of the sucrose transporter gene **OsSUT1** and impacts carbon-nitrogen balance.
