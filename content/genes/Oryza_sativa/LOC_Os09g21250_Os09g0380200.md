## Functional Descriptions:
   - These data suggested that the **YLC1** protein may be involved in Chl and lutein accumulation and chloroplast development at early leaf development in rice.
   - Real-time PCR analyses showed that the expression levels of the genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were affected in **YLC1** mutant at different temperatures.
   - In this study, we characterized a rice mutant named young leaf chlorosis 1 (**YLC1**) from a (6)(0)Co-irradiated population.
   - The Young Leaf Chlorosis 1 (**YLC1**) gene was isolated via map-based cloning and identified to encode a protein of unknown function belonging to the DUF3353 superfamily.
   - In rice protoplasts, the **YLC1** protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern.
   - Differential protein abundances of **OsV5A** and OsV5B in rice seedlings at different leaf developmental stages were also revealed.
   - Deficiency of **OsV5A** and OsV5B occurred in pre-emerged and emerging leaves in **OsV5A** seedlings at 22 Â°C, leading to reduced POR accumulation and chlorophyll content.
   - **OsV5A** apparently developed a specialized role for regulating POR abundances at the leaf pre-emergence stage while the same function is performed by OsV5B during leaf emergence and expansion.
   - Both **OsV5A** and OsV5B are localized in the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membranes.
   - **OsV5A** and OsV5B interact with two rice PORs (OsPORA and OsPORB) inside chloroplasts and they stabilize OsPORB in vitro under oxidative stress.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **OsV5A** is a J-like protein with four transmembrane domains.
