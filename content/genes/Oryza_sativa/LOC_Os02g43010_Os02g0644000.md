## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g43010](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g43010)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0644000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0644000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsVPE3,REP-2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Northern blot analysis indicated that **REP-2** mRNA was expressed in both maturing and germinating seeds.
   - Incubation of the de-embryonated seeds in 10(-6) M gibberellic acid induced the production of large amounts of REP-1, whereas **REP-2**beta levels declined rapidly.
   - Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, **REP-2**.
   - Bcl-2 suppresses hydrogen peroxide-induced programmed cell death via OsVPE2 and **OsVPE3**, but not via OsVPE1 and OsVPE4, in rice.
   - Moreover, we found that suppression of **OsVPE3** caused decreased leaf width and guard cell length in rice.
   - Suppression of **OsVPE3** Enhances Salt Tolerance by Attenuating Vacuole Rupture during Programmed Cell Death and Affects Stomata Development in Rice..
   - Therefore, we concluded that **OsVPE3** plays a crucial role in vacuole-mediated PCD and in stomatal development in rice.
   - Survival rate and chlorophyll retention analyses showed that suppression of **OsVPE3** clearly enhanced salt stress tolerance in transgenic rice compared with wild type.
   - Taken together, these results indicated that suppression of **OsVPE3** enhances salt tolerance by attenuating vacuole rupture during PCD.
   - Endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is involved in regulating the gibberellic acid-induced programmed cell death (PCD) of the aleurone layers by cooperating with **OsVPE3** during rice seed germination.
   - Further experiments indicated that GA up-regulated the **OsVPE3** transcript and VPE activity, and the effect was reversed by DPI.
   - Interaction between endogenous H 2 O 2 and **OsVPE3** in the GA-induced PCD of rice aleurone layers.
   - Furthermore, Ac-YVAD-CMK significantly blocked H2O2 accumulation, and DPI + Ac-YVAD-CMK had a more significant inhibitory effect compared with DPI alone, resulting in the delayed PCD, suggesting that **OsVPE3** regulates PCD by promoting H2O2 generation.
   - Meanwhile, DPI significantly inhibited the **OsVPE3** transcript and VPE activity, and in turn delayed PCD occurrence, suggesting that the H2O2 produced by the NOX pathway may regulate PCD by up-regulating the **OsVPE3** transcript.
   - Thus, the endogenous H2O2 produced by the NOX pathway mediates the GA-induced PCD of rice aleurone layers by interacting with **OsVPE3**.
