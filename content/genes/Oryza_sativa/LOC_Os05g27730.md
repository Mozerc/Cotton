## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsWRKY53**, a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-responsive rice WRKY gene, has been found to be involved in defense responses in rice.
   - Promoter Analysis of the Elicitor-Induced WRKY Gene**OsWRKY53**, Which Is Involved in Defense Responses in Rice.
   - We identified three tandem W-box elements, putative recognition sites for WRKY transcription factors, as cis elements that are essential to the elicitor-responsiveness of **OsWRKY53** by deletion and mutation analysis of the promoter by dual luciferase assay.
   - **OsWRKY53** was also induced in suspension-cultured rice cells by a fungal cerebroside elicitor and in rice plants by infection with the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.
   - A microarray analysis revealed that several defense-related genes, including pathogenesis-related protein genes such as PBZ1, were upregulated in rice cells overexpressing **OsWRKY53**.
   - These results strongly suggest that **OsWRKY53** is a transcription factor that plays important roles in elicitor-induced defense signaling pathways in rice.
   - Involvement of the elicitor-induced gene **OsWRKY53** in the expression of defense-related genes in rice.
   - Involvement of the OsMKK4-OsMPK1 Cascade and its Downstream Transcription Factor **OsWRKY53** in the Wounding Response in Rice.
   - Taken together, components involving in the wounding signaling pathway, OsMKK4-OsMPK1-**OsWRKY53**, can be important players in regulating crosstalk between abiotic stress and biotic stress.
   - **OsWRKY53** is also shown to be a negative regulator of plant growth.
   - The transcript levels of **OsWRKY53** are independent of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA), but positively regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), OsMPK3/OsMPK6.
   - Recently, a rice WRKY transcription factor **OsWRKY53** has been reported to function as a negative feedback modulator of OsMPK3/OsMPK6 and thereby to control the size of the investment a rice plant makes to defend against a chewing herbivore, the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis.
   - We investigated the performance of a piecing-sucking herbivore, the brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens, on transgenic plants that silence or overexpress **OsWRKY53**, and found that **OsWRKY53** activates rice defenses against BPH by activating an H2O2 burst and suppressing ethylene biosynthesis.
   - Phenotypic analyses showed that **OsWRKY53** overexpression led to enlarged leaf angles and increased grain size, in contrast to the erect leaves and smaller seeds in **OsWRKY53** mutant.
   - Transcription factor **OsWRKY53** positively regulates brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture.
   - In addition, the **OsWRKY53** exhibited decreased BR sensitivity, whereas **OsWRKY53** overexpression plants were hypersensitive to BR, suggesting that **OsWRKY53** positively regulates rice BR signaling.
   - Moreover, we show that **OsWRKY53** can interact with and be phosphorylated by OsMAPKK4-OsMAPK6 cascade, and the phosphorylation is required for the biological function of **OsWRKY53** in regulating BR responses.
   - Furthermore, we found that BR promotes **OsWRKY53** protein accumulation but represses **OsWRKY53** transcript level.
   - Taken together, this study revealed the novel role of **OsWRKY53** as a regulator of rice BR signaling, and also suggested a potential role of **OsWRKY53** in mediating the crosstalk between the hormone and other signaling pathways.
   - Both **OsWRKY53** and OsMYB63 are abundantly expressed in sclerenchyma cells of leaf vascular bundles.
   - The **OsWRKY53**-overexpressing and OsMYB63 knockout plants had thinner sclerenchyma cell walls, showing susceptibility to Xoo, while the **OsWRKY53** knockout and OsMYB63-overexpressing plants had thicker sclerenchyma cell walls, exhibiting resistance to Xoo.
   - Silencing OsI-BAK1 (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, **OsWRKY53** and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene.
   - **OsWRKY53** Promotes Abscisic Acid Accumulation to Accelerate Leaf Senescence and Inhibit Seed Germination by Downregulating Abscisic Acid Catabolic Genes in Rice.
   - In this study, we showed that **OsWRKY53** is a positive regulator of leaf senescence and a negative regulator of seed germination in rice.
   - Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays revealed that **OsWRKY53** directly bound to the promoters of OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox2 to repress their transcription, resulting in elevated endogenous ABA contents that promoted premature leaf senescence in the **OsWRKY53**-oe plants.
   - It indicates that **OsWRKY53** is a positive regulator through regulating ABA accumulation to promote leaf senescence.
   - Taken together, **OsWRKY53** suppresses the transcript of ABA catabolic genes to promote ABA accumulation to modulate ABA-induced leaf senescence and ABA-mediated inhibition of seed germination.
   - The **OsWRKY53**-overexpressing (**OsWRKY53**-oe) plants showed early yellowing leaves, while the **OsWRKY53** (**OsWRKY53**) knockout mutants maintained green leaves than the wild type under natural, dark-induced, and ABA-induced senescence conditions.
   - **OsWRKY53** expression was induced in leaves under aging, dark, and ABA treatment.
   - In addition, OsWRKY70 overexpression lines displayed an enlarged leaf angle, reduced plant height, longer grains, and higher BR sensitivity, phenotypes similar to those of **OsWRKY53** overexpression lines.
   - The transcription factor **OsWRKY53** positively regulates grain size through brassinosteroid (BR) signaling and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) cascades.
   - Functions of OsWRKY24, OsWRKY70 and **OsWRKY53** in regulating grain size in rice.
   - OsWRKY24 functions redundantly with **OsWRKY53**, while OsWRKY70 functions differently from **OsWRKY53** in regulating grain size.
   - However, whether the **OsWRKY53** homologs OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 also contribute to grain size which remains unknown.
   - Importantly, a systematic characterization of seed length in the oswrky70 single, the **OsWRKY53** oswrky70 double and the oswrky24 **OsWRKY53** oswrky70 triple mutant indicated that loss of OsWRKY70 also leads to increased seed length, suggesting that OsWRKY70 might play a role distinct from that of **OsWRKY53** in regulating grain size.
   - Taken together, these findings suggest that OsWRKY24 and OsWRKY70 regulate rice grain size redundantly and independently from **OsWRKY53**.
