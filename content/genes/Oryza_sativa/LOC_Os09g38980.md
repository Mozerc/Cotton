## Functional Descriptions:
   - This study characterized a novel rice thermo-sensitive chloroplast development 9 (**TCD9**) mutant, which exhibited the albino phenotype before the 3-leaf stage grown below 24 degrees C whereas displayed normal green at over 28 degrees C or even at 20 degrees C after 5-leaf stage.
   - Our observations suggest that the nuclear-encoded Cpn60alpha protein **TCD9** plays a crucial role in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
   - Importance of the rice **TCD9** encoding alpha subunit of chaperonin protein 60 (Cpn60alpha) for the chloroplast development during the early leaf stage.
   - The map-based cloning and molecular complementation tests revealed that the mutation of **TCD9** encoding alpha subunit of Cpn60 protein (Cpn60alpha), localized in chloroplasts, was responsible for albino phenotype.
   - The transcriptional analysis indicated that all expression levels of the studied genes related to chloroplast development in **TCD9** mutant were seriously affected in the albino seedlings at 20 degrees C, whereas some of them recovered into normal levels in green-seedlings at 32 degrees C.
