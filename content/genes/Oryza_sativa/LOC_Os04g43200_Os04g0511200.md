- **Gene Symbol:** EFA27,OsClo5
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsClo5** functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by interacting with OsDi19-5 to negatively affect salt stress tolerance in rice seedlings.
   - In addition, **OsClo5** enhanced the inhibitory effect of OsDi19-5 in the tobacco transient system, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in rice seedlings under salt stress.
   - Thereby, biochemical and molecular genetic experiments were carried out, the results revealed that **OsClo5** had was able to bind calcium and phospholipids in vitro and localized in the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum in rice protoplasts.
   - Overexpression of **OsClo5** decreased cold tolerance, and RNAi lines of **OsClo5** had higher survival than WT seedlings.
   - **OsClo5** is a constitutively expressed caleosin protein that regulates plant cold resistance through inhibition of jasmonate signalling and JA synthesis.
   - **OsClo5** inhibited one jasmonate biosynthetic gene and several jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) genes, which were upregulated in response to cold stress.
   - Overexpression lines and RNAi lines of **OsClo5** were subjected to cold stress and recovery to measure electrolyte leakage and survival rate.
