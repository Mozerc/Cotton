## Functional Descriptions:
   - Antisense **SPK** transformants lacked the ability to accumulate storage products such as starch, but produced watery seed with a large amount of Suc instead, as the result of an inhibition of Suc degradation.
   - Rice **SPK**, a Calmodulin-Like Domain Protein Kinase, Is Required for Storage Product Accumulation during Seed Development: Phosphorylation of Sucrose Synthase Is a Possible Factor.
   - Rice **SPK**, a calcium-dependent protein kinase, is expressed uniquely in the endosperm of immature seed, and its involvement in the biosynthetic pathways of storage products was suggested.
   - A gene encoding a calcium-dependent seed-specific protein kinase (**SPK**) is abundantly expressed in developing rice seeds (Kawasaki, T et al.
