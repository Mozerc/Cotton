## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of the **OsYSL16** promoter fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene showed that **OsYSL16** is expressed in the root epidermis and vascular bundles of whole plants.
   - Our results suggest that the function of **OsYSL16** in Fe-homeostasis is to enable distribution of iron within a plant.
   - Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (**OsYSL16**) enhances iron efficiency.
   - During germination, the rate of Fe-utilization from the seeds was higher in the **OsYSL16** activation lines than in the WT seeds.
   - Promoter fusions of **OsYSL16** to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) showed that **OsYSL16** was highly expressed in the vascular tissues of the root, leaf, and spikelet, and in leaf mesophyll cells.
   - **OsYSL16** has 85 % similarity to both OsYSL15 and the iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter OsYSL2.
   - In the present study, we show that **OsYSL16** functionally complemented a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when grown on medium containing iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid, but not when grown on medium containing iron(II)-nicotianamine.
   - **OsYSL16**-knockdown seedlings were smaller than wild-type seedlings when only iron(III)chloride was supplied as an iron source.
   - The iron concentration in shoots of **OsYSL16**-knockdown plants was similar to that of the wild type; however, they showed more severe chlorosis than wild-type plants under iron-deficient conditions.
   - Furthermore, **OsYSL16**-knockdown plants accumulated more iron in the vascular bundles of the leaves.
   - Our results suggest that **OsYSL16** plays a role in the allocation of iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid via the vascular bundles.
   - **OsYSL16** plays a role in the allocation of iron.
   - The Fe concentration in shoots was also higher in the **OsYSL16** activation lines than in the WT.
   - GUS staining of transgenic rice carrying **OsYSL16** promoter-GUS showed that **OsYSL16** was mainly expressed in vascular bundles of rachilla as well as palea and lemma.
   - Our results indicate that **OsYSL16** expressed in the vascular bundles of rachilla is important for preferential distribution of Cu to the stamens, while **OsYSL16** in vascular bundles of palea and lemma is involved in Cu redistribution under Cu-limited conditions in rice.
   - **OsYSL16** mutant showed low pollen germination, but this was rescued by addition of Cu in the medium.
   - **OsYSL16** is Required for Preferential Cu Distribution to Floral Organs in Rice..
   - Knockout of **OsYSL16** resulted in decreased Cu distribution to the stamens, but increased distribution to the palea and lemma.
   - Furthermore, we found that redistribution of Cu from palea and lemma was impaired in **OsYSL16** mutant after exposure to Cu-free solution.
