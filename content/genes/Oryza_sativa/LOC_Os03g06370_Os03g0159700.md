## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g06370](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g06370)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0159700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0159700)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsNBL3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - RNA interference lines of **OsNBL3** exhibited enhanced disease resistance similar to that of nbl3, while the disease resistance in overexpression lines did not differ from that of the wild type.
   - Overall, the results demonstrated that the PPR protein-coding gene **OsNBL3** is essential for mitochondrial development and functions, and its disruption causes the lesion mimic phenotype and enhances disease resistance and tolerance to salt in rice.
