## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of Rice Homeobox Genes, OsHOX22 and **OsHOX24**, and Over-expression of **OsHOX24** in Transgenic Arabidopsis Suggest Their Role in Abiotic Stress Response.
   - Over-expression of **OsHOX24** imparted higher sensitivity to stress hormone, ABA, and abiotic stresses in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants as revealed by various physiological and phenotypic assays.
   - In this study, we carried out functional analysis of two candidate stress-responsive HD-ZIP I class homeobox genes from rice, OsHOX22, and **OsHOX24**.
   - **OsHOX24** over-expression rice seedlings showed reduced root and shoot growth under salinity and desiccation stress (DS) conditions.
   - In the present study, we raised rice transgenics over-expressing stress-responsive **OsHOX24** gene (rice homeodomain-leucine zipper I sub-family member) and analyzed their response to various abiotic stresses at different stages of development.
   - At the seed germination stage, rice transgenics over-expressing **OsHOX24** exhibited enhanced sensitivity to abiotic stress conditions and abscisic acid as compared to wild-type (WT).
   - Over-Expression of **OsHOX24** Confers Enhanced Susceptibility to Abiotic Stresses in Transgenic Rice via Modulating Stress-Responsive Gene Expression.
   - Taken together, our findings highlighted the role of **OsHOX24** in regulation of abiotic stress responses via modulating the expression of stress-responsive genes in rice.
   - **OsHOX24** mediates regulation of desiccation stress response via complex regulatory network as indicated by its binding to several target genes including transcription factors in rice.
   - Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that **OsHOX24** direct target genes were involved in several biological processes, including plant development, ABA-mediated signalling pathway, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, ion transport, abiotic and biotic stress responses besides transcriptional and translational regulation.
   - In this study, we identified downstream targets of **OsHOX24** under control and desiccation stress conditions via chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) approach in wild-type and **OsHOX24** over-expression transgenic in rice.
