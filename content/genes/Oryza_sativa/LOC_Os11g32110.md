## Functional Descriptions:
   - Therefore, the **OsARF1** was shown to be essential for growth in vegetative organs and seed development.
   - **OsARF1** is the first full-length member of auxin response factor (ARF) gene family to be cloned from monocot plant.
   - Antisense phenotypes reveal a functional expression of **OsARF1**, an auxin response factor, in transgenic rice.
   - A rice homologue of the auxin response factor (ARF) family of transcriptional regulators, **OsARF1**, was identified.
   - Steady-state levels of **OsARF1** mRNA correlated positively with auxin-dependent differential growth: gravitropic stimulation enhanced the amount of **OsARF1** transcript in the lower, faster-growing flank accompanied by a decrease in the upper flank of gravitropically stimulated rice coleoptiles.
   - Exogenous auxin up-regulated the steady-state level of **OsARF1** mRNA within 15-30 min.
   - Thus, **OsARF1** is the first ARF that classifies as an early auxin-responsive gene.
   - **OsARF1**, an auxin response factor from rice, is auxin-regulated and classifies as a primary auxin responsive gene.
   - In R109 leaves, the **OsARF1** gene, which regulates plant growth, was expressed in consistence with growth promotion by P.
   - Inversely, **OsARF1** expression was coincident with inhibition in growth of HER1 leaves.
   - The AS-**OsARF1** plants showed extremely low growth, poor vigor, short curled leaves and tillered but were sterile.
   - Using quantitative RT-PCR this study found that, the transcript abundance of **OsARF1** was significantly higher in embryonic tissues than in vegetative tissues.
