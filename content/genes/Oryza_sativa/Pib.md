## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Pib</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The deduced amino acid sequence of the **Pib** gene product contains a nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs); thus, **Pib** is a member of the NBS-LRR class of plant disease resistance genes.
   - The **Pib** gene for rice blast resistance belongs to the nucleotide binding and leucine-rich repeat class of plant disease resistance genes.
   - Development of pyramided lines with two resistance genes, Pish and **Pib**, for blast disease (Magnaporthe oryzae B. Couch) in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - Here we describe the isolation and characterization of **Pib**, one of the rice blast resistance genes.
   - We report the development of pyramided lines with two major blast resistance genes, Pish and **Pib**, and the evaluation of the combining effect of them.
   - The two genes pyramided lines were selected from the progenies of a cross between one near isogenic line (NIL), which harbours Pish, and another NIL, which harbours **Pib**, in the genetic background of blast susceptible variety, CO 39.
   - We confirmed the additive effect of Pish and **Pib** in the pyramided lines by their reaction patterns to blast isolates, suggesting the potential availabilities of the combinations of these genes.
   - **Pib** gene expression was induced upon altered environmental conditions, such as altered temperatures and darkness.
   - The rice blast resistance gene **Pib** confers broad-spectrum resistance against Southeast Asian M.
   - Together, the new **Pib** alleles are an important genetic resource for rice blast resistance breeding programs and provide new information on rice-M.
