- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0155500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0155500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** FLR14
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knockouts of FLR3 and/or **FLR14** increased the number of white-core grains caused by aberrant accumulation of storage substances, resulting in poor grain quality.
   - Conversely, the overexpression of FLR3 or **FLR14** reduced grain chalkiness and improved grain quality.
   - We also demonstrated that FLR3 and **FLR14** reduced grain chalkiness by alleviating heat-induced oxidative stress in rice endosperm.
   - Transcriptome and metabolome analyses showed that genes and metabolites involved in the oxidative stress response were significantly up-regulated in flr3 and **FLR14** grains.
   - The content of reactive oxygen species was significantly increased in flr3 and **FLR14** mutant endosperm but decreased in overexpression lines.
