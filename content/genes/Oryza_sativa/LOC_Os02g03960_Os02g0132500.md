- **Gene Symbol:** OsbZIP14
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - By knocking out the **OsbZIP14** gene in the rice cultivar Zhonghua 11, we observed that the knockout mutant **OsbZIP14** exhibited dwarfism with reduced tiller during the grain-filling stage.
   - Our results suggested that **OsbZIP14** acts as a key TF gene through the concerted action of OsbZIP58 and **OsbZIP14** during rice filling under heat stress.
   - Under high-temperature treatment, it was also demonstrated that in the **OsbZIP14** mutant, the expression of the OsbZIP58 gene, a key regulator of rice seed storage protein (SSP) accumulation, was upregulated.
   - Integrated ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq Data Analysis to Reveal **OsbZIP14** Function in Rice in Response to Heat Stress..
