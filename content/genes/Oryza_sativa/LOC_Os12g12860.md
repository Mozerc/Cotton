## Functional Descriptions:
   - Differential screening of a stage-specific cDNA library of Indica rice has been used to identify two genes expressed in pre-pollination stage panicles, namely OSIPA and **OSIPK** coding for proteins similar to expansins/pollen allergens and calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), respectively.
   - Northern analysis and in situ hybridizations indicate that OSIPA expresses exclusively in pollen while **OSIPK** expresses in pollen as well as anther wall.
   - Promoter of OSIPA is active during the late stages of pollen development and remains active till the anthesis, whereas, **OSIPK** promoter is active to a low level in developing anther till the pollen matures.
   - Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that **OsCPK29** interacts in vitro as well as in vivo with the MADS68 transcription factor which is a known regulator of pollen development.
   - **OsCPK29** interacts with MADS68 to regulate pollen development in rice.
   - Therefore, phenotypic observations and molecular studies suggest that **OsCPK29** is an important regulator of pollen development in rice.
   - Here, we report the functional characterization of a novel **OsCPK29** from rice, which is mainly expressed during pollen maturation stages of the anther.
   - **OsCPK29** knockdown rice plants exhibit reduced fertility, set fewer seeds, and produce collapsed non-viable pollen grains that do not germinate.
   - **OsCPK29** exclusively localizes in the nucleus, and its N-terminal variable domain is responsible for retaining it in the nucleus.
