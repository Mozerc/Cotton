## Functional Descriptions:
   - **JAmyb** overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis improved tolerance to high-salinity stress during seed germination, seedling growth, and root elongation.
   - In this study, we identified a rice R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene, **JAmyb**, as a gene whose overexpression causes tolerance to high salinity.
   - Several transcription factors involved in the jasmonate (JA)-mediated stress response are also regulated by **JAmyb**.
   - Role of the rice transcription factor **JAmyb** in abiotic stress response.
   - **JAmyb** has been reported to be associated with disease response.
   - In rice seedlings, **JAmyb** expression was induced by high-salinity and high-osmotic stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that **JAmyb** is responsible for abiotic stress response.
   - Microarray analysis showed that the overexpression of **JAmyb** stimulates the expression of several defense-associated genes, some of which have been predicted to be involved in osmotic adjustment, ROS removal, and ion homeostasis.
   - Our observations suggest that **JAmyb** plays a role in JA-mediated abiotic stress response in addition to biotic stress response in rice.
   - After inoculation with the blast isolate Hoku1, the expression of **OsJAmyb** was more rapidly and strongly induced in the seedlings of blast-resistant Heikezijing compared with that in the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo.
   - The expression of **OsJAmyb** gene was detected in the root, stem, leaf, sheath, immature panicle and flowering panicle of rice, with highest expression in the leaf.
   - The **OsJAmyb** overexpressing transgenic lines (T3 generation) in Suyunuo showed increased resistance to blast infection with less lesion number in inoculated leaves compared with non-transgenic control plants.
   - The results indicate that **OsJAmyb** might be involved in the resistance to blast infection in rice.
   - In this study we identified one MYB transcription factor gene **OsJAmyb** from rice landrace Heikezijing, which encodes a protein with 283 amino-acid residues belonging to R2R3-type MYB transcription factor family.
   - Through combined analysis of differential expression and annotations of the predicted genes within qBBR11-4 between two sets of rice accessions selected based on haplotypes and disease phenotypes, we identified the transcription factor **OsMYB21** as the candidate gene for qBBR11-4.
   - Genome-Wide Association Mapping and Gene Expression Analysis Reveal the Negative Role of **OsMYB21** in Regulating Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.
   - The **OsMYB21** overexpressing plants exhibited decreased resistance to bacterial blight, accompanied with down-regulation of several defense-related genes compared with the wild-type plants.
   - Conclusion: The results suggest that **OsMYB21** negatively regulates bacterial blight resistance in rice, and this gene can be a promising target in rice breeding by using the gene editing method.
