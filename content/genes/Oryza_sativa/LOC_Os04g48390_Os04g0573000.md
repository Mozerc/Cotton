## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we report on the characterization of rice osa-miR827 and its two target genes, **OsSPX-MFS1** and OsSPX-MFS2, which encode SPX-MFS proteins predicted to be implicated in phosphate (Pi) sensing or transport.
   - **OsSPX-MFS1** mRNA is mainly expressed in shoots under sufficient Pi supply while its expression is reduced on Pi starvation, revealing a direct relationship between induction of osa-miR827 and down-regulation of **OsSPX-MFS1**.
   - Functional characterization of the rice SPX-MFS family reveals a key role of **OsSPX-MFS1** in controlling phosphate homeostasis in leaves.
   - The function of **OsSPX-MFS1** in Pi homeostasis was analysed using an **OsSPX-MFS1** mutant (mfs1) and osa-miR827 overexpression line (miR827-Oe).
   - Mutation in **OsSPX-MFS1** (mfs1) and overexpression of the upstream miR827 (miR827-Oe) plants impaired Pi homeostasis in the leaves.
   - * The results suggest that **OsSPX-MFS1** is a key player in maintaining Pi homeostasis in the leaves, potentially acting as a Pi transporter.
   - * Transcript analyses revealed that members of the SPX-MFS family were mainly expressed in the shoots, with **OsSPX-MFS1** and OsSPX-MFS3 being suppressed by Pi deficiency, while OsSPX-MFS2 was induced.
   - Finally, heterologous complementation of a yeast mutant impaired in Pi transporter was used to assess the capacity of **OsSPX-MFS1** to transport Pi.
   - In addition, studies in yeast revealed that **OsSPX-MFS1** may be involved in Pi transport.
   - In parallel, we analyzed the responses of the two **OsSPX-MFS1** and OsSPX-MFS2 gene targets to Pi starvation.
   - This suggests that **OsSPX-MFS1** and OsSPX-MFS2 are both negatively regulated by osa-miR827 abundance although they respond differently to external Pi conditions.
   - Furthermore, we show that heterologous expression of the rice homologue **OsSPX-MFS1** mediates Pi influx to yeast vacuoles.
