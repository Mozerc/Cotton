- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0715500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0715500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsTVLP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of **OsTVLP1** was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of plant disease resistance responses, and by infection of the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea.
   - Importantly, the expression of **OsTVLP1** was activated specifically in disease resistance response induced by BTH and in an incompatible interaction between rice and the blast fungus.
   - Our observations suggest that **OsTVLP1** may play a role in rice disease resistance response against pathogen infection.
