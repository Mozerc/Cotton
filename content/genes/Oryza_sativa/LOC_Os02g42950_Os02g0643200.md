- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0643200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0643200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsYABBY4,TOB2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Beta-glucuronidase reporter assay and in situ analysis consistently revealed that **OsYABBY4** was expressed in the meristems and developing vascular tissue of rice, predominantly in the phloem tissue, suggesting that the function of the rice gene is different from those of its counterparts in eudicots.
   - These data together suggest that **OsYABBY4** serves as a DNA-binding intermediate protein for SLR1 and is associated with the GA signaling pathway regulating gene expression during plant growth and development.
   - We report on an important role for **OsYABBY4** in negative control of the expression of a GA biosynthetic gene by binding to the promoter region of the gibberellin 20-oxidase 2 gene (GA20ox2), which is a direct target of SLR1 (the sole DELLA protein negatively controlling GA responses in rice).
   - RNAi knockdown of **TOB2** or TOB3 in the tob1 mutant caused abnormal spikelet development.
   - Furthermore, simultaneous knockdown of both **TOB2** and TOB3 in tob1 affected not only spikelet, but also inflorescence development.
