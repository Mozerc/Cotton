## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identification of rice Di19 family reveals **OsDi19-4** involved in drought resistance.
   - Overexpression of **OsDi19-4** in rice increased drought tolerance by enhancing ROS-scavenging activity.
   - In this study, we found that overexpressing **OsDi19-4** in rice altered the expression of a series of ABA-responsive genes, resulting in strong ABA hypersensitive phenotypes including ABA-induced seed germination inhibition, early seedling growth inhibition and stomatal closure.
   - **OsDi19-4** acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response in rice.
   - Taken together, these data demonstrate that **OsDi19-4** acts downstream of OsCDPK14 to positively regulate ABA response by modulating the expression of ABA-responsive genes in rice.
   - On the contrary, **OsDi19-4** knock-down lines were less sensitive to ABA.
   - Additionally, OsCDPK14 was identified to interact with **OsDi19-4** and be responsible for the phosphorylation of **OsDi19-4**, and the phosphorylation of **OsDi19-4** was further enhanced after the treatment of ABA.
   - Transient expression assays confirmed the direct regulation role of **OsDi19-4**, and the regulation was further enhanced by the increased phosphorylation of **OsDi19-4** after the treatment of ABA.
