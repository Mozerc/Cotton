## Functional Descriptions:
   - Du1 specifically affects the splicing efficiency of **Wx**(b) and regulates starch biosynthesis by mediating the expression of starch biosynthesis genes.
   - These results strongly suggest that Du1 may function as a regulator of the starch biosynthesis by affecting the splicing of **Wx**(b) and the expression of other genes involved in the rice starch biosynthetic pathways.
   - Du1, encoding a novel Prp1 protein, regulates starch biosynthesis through affecting the splicing of **Wx**b pre-mRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - In order to examine the effects of different alleles on the gene expression at the waxy locus, the **Wx** gene product which controls the synthesis of amylose was isolated from endosperm starch of rice plants and analysed by electrophoretic techniques.
   - The major protein bound to starch granules was absent in most of waxy strains and increased with the number of **Wx** alleles in triploid endosperms, suggesting that the major protein is the **Wx** gene product.
   - The rice waxy (**Wx**) locus has two functional alleles, **Wx**a and **Wx**b, which are defined by a large difference in the amount of the gene product, called **Wx** protein, that accumulates in mature seeds.
   - The level of the gene product bound to starch granules was slightly lower in the NILs with **Wx**op than that with **Wx**b, showing a positive correlation with amylose content in the endosperm.
   - Common non-waxy ( **Wx**) rice cultivars contain two different alleles at the waxy locus, designated **Wx**(a) and **Wx**(b), which encode different levels of granule-bound starch synthases and are hence involved in the control of endosperm amylose content.
   - Gene prediction analysis of the 11-kb DNA sequence containing qGC-6 identified only one putative ORF, which encodes granule-bound starch synthesis protein (**Wx** protein).
   - Genetic analyses and transgenic experiments revealed that low AC in Haopi was controlled by a novel allele of the **Wx** locus, **Wx**(hp), encoding a granule-bound starch synthase (GBSSI).
   - sativa), suggesting that **Wx** b might have been selected for through the difference in grain quality during domestication.
   - Most japonica-type glutinous rice was found to have a 23-bp duplication in the second exon, which causes loss of the function of granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) encoded by the **Wx** gene.
   - Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, **Wx**, OsSSIIa, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression.
   - Genetic Polymorphism of **Wx** Gene and Its Correlation with Main Grain Quality Characteristics in Rice.
   - Molecular Characterization of **Wx**-mq, a Novel Mutant Gene for Low-amylose Content in Endosperm of Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - It is of interest that the **Wx**b allele of rice carrying the G to T mutation of intron 1 has been conserved in the history of rice cultivation because there is a low amylose content of the seed caused by this mutation.
   - Genetic evidences revealed that **Wx** might contribute equally to the grain amylose content-controlling gene as well as gel consistency.
   - A rice **Wx** gene encoding a granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) was introduced into the null-mutant waxy (**Wx**) rice, and its effect on endosperm starches was examined.
   - To elucidate the allelic diversity at the Waxy (**Wx**) gene which controls the amylose synthesis, two cultivated strains having opaque endosperms were studied.
   - The genetic experiments revealed that an allele, **Wx**op, controls opaque endosperms which show chalky as **Wx** endosperms in spite of the production of amylose.
   - **Wx** a drastically enhanced the quantitative level of **Wx** protein as well as the amylose content in endosperm starch as compared with **Wx** b.
   - glaberrima have a normal sequence of GT at the 5' splice junction of the first intron, representing a high expression level of the **Wx** transcripts in the endosperm and a high beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity in protoplasts.
   - Extracts from mature anthers indicated that the gene product was markedly reduced in the NILs with **Wx**op as well as that with **Wx**, showing an altered expression in the tissue specificity in the **Wx**op lines.
   - Labelle (**Wx**(a)) in terms of a higher degree of branching and size distribution.
   - In cultivated rice two wild-type alleles, **Wx**a and **Wx**b, predominate at the waxy locus, which encodes granule-bound starch synthase.
   - rufipogon, its wild progenitor, by this mutation, and, therefore, a single base change that has altered the regulation of the **Wx** gene at the posttranscriptional level probably occurred during the domestication of rice.
   - To investigate the effects of **Wx** and its interaction with SSIII-2 on grain ECQs, a population from a hybrid combination was established as a research material.
   - The **Wx** gene encodes a granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) and plays a key role in determining rice eating and cooking qualities (ECQs).
   - The combined effects of different SNPs of **Wx** are very important for rice quality breeding.
   - The results revealed various effects of SSIII-2 on rice quality under different backgrounds of **Wx** alleles.
   - The findings also shed light on the evolution of various **Wx** alleles, which have greatly contributed to improving the eating and cooking quality of rice.
   - ), the varied activities of natural **Wx** alleles regulate different amylose contents (AC), gel consistency (GC), and pasting viscosity of grain starches; these factors together influence the grain appearance, cooking/eating quality, and starch physical characters (Zhang et al.
   - Here we identified a rare **Wx** allele, **Wx**mw , which combines a favorable AC, improved ECQ and grain transparency.
   - The origin of **Wx** la provides new insights into the improvement of grain quality in rice.
   - This study thus provides insights into the evolution of the **Wx** locus and facilitates molecular breeding for quality in rice.
   - A genome-wide association study highlighted the **Wx** gene as the major factor underlying variation in taste and eating quality.
   - Genomic Regions Involved in Differences in Eating and Cooking Quality Other than **Wx** and Alk Genes between indica and japonica Rice Cultivars.
