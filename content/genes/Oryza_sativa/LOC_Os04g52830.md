- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Ctb1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We previously identified two closely linked quantitative trait loci, **Ctb1** and Ctb2, for cold tolerance at the booting stage of Norin-PL8 in the long arm of chromosome 4.
   - A comparison of the degrees of cold tolerance of the NILs indicated that **Ctb1** is located in the 56-kb region covered by a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, OSJNBa0058 K23, that had been sequenced by the International Rice Genome Sequence Project.
   - We were also able to show that **Ctb1** is likely to be associated with anther length, which is one of major factors in cold tolerance at the booting stage.
   - Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus **Ctb1** for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice.
   - We previously mapped a quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance, **Ctb1**, to a 56-kb region containing 7 putative genes.
   - Map-based cloning of the rice cold tolerance gene **Ctb1**.
