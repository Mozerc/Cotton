## Functional Descriptions:
   - **D14**-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling.
   - We characterized a tillering dwarf mutant **D88** derived from Oryza sativa ssp.
   - A reduction in number and size of parenchyma cells around stem marrow cavity as well as a delay in the elongation of parenchyma cells caused slender tillers and dwarfism in the **D88** mutant.
   - Furthermore, osmads57-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and OsMADS57's function in tillering was dependent on **D14**.
   - The **D14** mutant exhibits increased shoot branch-ing with reduced plant height like the previously characterized strigolactone-deficient and -insensitive mutants d10 and d3, respectively.
   - Here, we provide evidence that DWARF14 (**D14**) inhibits rice tillering and may act as a new compo-nent of the strigolactone-dependent branching inhibition pathway.
   - **D14**, a strigolactone-insensitive mutant of rice, shows an accelerated outgrowth of tillers.
   - Here, we identified a rice mutant **HTD2** from one of the 15,000 transgenic rice lines, which is characterized by a high tillering and dwarf phenotype.
   - **HTD2** transcripts were expressed mainly in leaf.
   - Moreover, D10 expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, d10, **D14**, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1).
   - Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets **D14** (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice.
   - SL signalling requires the hormone-dependent interaction of DWARF 14 (**D14**), a probable candidate SL receptor, with DWARF 3 (D3), an F-box component of the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.
   - Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with OsTB1, target **D14** to control tillering.
   - However, unlike with d10, the **D14** branching phenotype could not be rescued by exogenous strigolactones.
   - The potential relationship between the tiller formation associated genes and **D88** is discussed and future identification of the substrate for **D88** may lead to the characterization of new pathways regulating plant development.
   - We propose that **D14** functions downstream of strigolactone synthesis, as a component of hormone signaling or as an enzyme that participates in the conversion of strigolactones to the bioactive form.
   - Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires **D14** and the SCF(D3) ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation.
   - The results suggest that the **HTD2** gene could negatively regulate tiller bud outgrowth by the strigolactone pathway.
   - Identification and characterization of **HTD2**: a novel gene negatively regulating tiller bud outgrowth in rice.
   - **D88**, thus, represents a new category of genes that regulates cell growth and organ development and consequently plant architecture.
   - Loss of function of **HTD2** resulted in a significantly increased expression of HTD1, D10 and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway.
   - The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the alpha/beta hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (**D14**) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception.
   - We demonstrate that, in a **D14**- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth.
   - In addition, we show that **D14** protein is contained in phloem sap and transported through the phloem to axillary buds in rice.
   - Additionally, compared with other **D14** allelic mutants, htd4 was the first mutant of **D14** discovered in indica, and the differences of many yield traits such as plant height, seed-setting rates, and grain sizes between htd4 and WT were less than those between other **D14** allelic mutants and WT.
   - Identification and Molecular Mapping of Indica High-tillering Dwarf Mutant htd4, a Mild Phenotype Allelic Mutant of **D14** in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - We conclude that the absence of functional **D14** caused the high-tillering dwarf phenotype of htd4.
   - Our results may provide vital information for the research on **D14** function and the application of htd4 in molecular breeding.
   - This stimulates the interaction between **D14** and D3, leading to the ubiquitination and degradation of the transcriptional repressor protein D53.
   - Rationally Designed Strigolactone Analogs as Antagonists of the **D14** Receptor.
   - This study revealed that DHTA-34 played an important role in inhabiting tiller development in rice and further identifying the function of **D14**.
