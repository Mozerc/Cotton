## Functional Descriptions:
   - cDNAs encoding homogentisic acid geranylgeranyl transferase (**HGGT**), which catalyzes the committed step of tocotrienol biosynthesis, were isolated from barley, wheat and rice seeds.
   - Overexpression of the barley **HGGT** in corn seeds resulted in an increase in tocotrienol and tocopherol content of as much as six-fold.
   - Our results indicate that **SGD1** is essential for plant development and cold tolerance in rice.
   - A map-based cloning strategy and subsequent complementation test showed that **SGD1** encodes homogentisate phytyltransferase (HPT), a key enzyme in tocopherol biosynthesis.
   - The **RTD1** mutant showed overall growth retardation throughout the growth period.
   - The cold-related C-repeat-binding factor (CBF)/dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1 (DREB1) genes were significantly upregulated in **RTD1** under natural growth conditions.
   - **RTD1** encodes a homogentisate phytyltransferase catalyzing a key step in rice tocopherol biosynthesis, confers cold tolerance and regulates rice development by affecting the accumulation of DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the **RTD1** gene encoded a homogentisate phytyltransferase, a key enzyme catalyzing the committed step in tocopherol biosynthesis.
   - Cold tolerance was found to be reduced in **RTD1**.
   - Moreover, **RTD1** exhibited a reduced response to gibberellin (GA).
   - Therefore, it appears that the antioxidant potential of transgenic oil-producing plants such as soybean, sunflower, and corn may be enhanced by overexpressing **OsHGGT** during seed germination.
