## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results show that **LGG** functions at the very early stage of panicle development.
   - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout and overexpression of **LGG** led to longer and shorter grains than wild type, respectively, showing that **LGG** regulates spikelet hull length.
   - Longitudinal cell numbers of spikelet hulls of **LGG**, knockout and overexpressed plants were significantly different from those of the wild type, suggesting that **LGG** might regulate longitudinal cell proliferation in the spikelet hull.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that **LGG** might be a regulator of cell cycle and cell division in the rice spikelet hull.
   - The Large grain (**LGG**) mutant, found in the nDart1-tagged lines of Koshihikari, is caused by a truncated nDart1-3 and 355<U+2009>bp deletion in the 5' UTR of **LGG**, which encodes a putative RNA-binding protein, through transposon display and cosegregation analysis between grain length and **LGG** genotype in F2 and F3.
   - RNA-Seq analysis of 1-mm-long young panicles from **LGG** knockout and overexpressing plants revealed that the expressions of many cell cycle-related genes were reduced in knockout plants relative to **LGG**-overexpressing plants and wild type, whereas some genes for cell proliferation were highly expressed in knockout plants.
