## Functional Descriptions:
   - More importantly, the RCc3:**OsNAC10** plants showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance at the reproductive stage, increasing grain yield by 25% to 42% and by 5% to 14% over controls in the field under drought and normal conditions, respectively.
   - **ONAC122** and ONAC131 were also induced by treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene).
   - Our results suggest that both **ONAC122** and ONAC131 have important roles in rice disease resistance responses through the regulated expression of other defense- and signaling-related genes.
   - Functions of rice NAC transcriptional factors, **ONAC122** and ONAC131, in defense responses against Magnaporthe grisea.
   - Here, we characterized two rice pathogen-responsive NAC transcription factors, **ONAC122** and ONAC131.
   - Grain yield of GOS2:**OsNAC10** plants in the field, in contrast, remained similar to that of controls under both normal and drought conditions.
   - Overall, our results demonstrated that root-specific overexpression of **OsNAC10** enlarges roots, enhancing drought tolerance of transgenic plants, which increases grain yield significantly under field drought conditions.
   - Root-specific expression of **OsNAC10** improves drought tolerance and grain yield in rice under field drought conditions.
   - Overexpression of **OsNAC10** in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter GOS2 and the root-specific promoter RCc3 increased the plant tolerance to drought, high salinity, and low temperature at the vegetative stage.
   - Here, we report the results of a functional genomics approach that identified a rice NAC (an acronym for NAM [No Apical Meristem], ATAF1-2, and CUC2 [Cup-Shaped Cotyledon]) domain gene, **OsNAC10**, which improved performance of transgenic rice plants under field drought conditions.
   - **OsNAC10**, one of the effective members selected from prescreening, is expressed predominantly in roots and panicles and induced by drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid.
   - **ONAC122** and ONAC131 expression was induced after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, and the M.
   - These differences in performance under field drought conditions reflect the differences in expression of **OsNAC10**-dependent target genes in roots as well as in leaves of the two transgenic plants, as revealed by microarray analyses.
   - Root diameter of the RCc3:**OsNAC10** plants was thicker by 1.
