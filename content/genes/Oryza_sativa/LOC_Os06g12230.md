## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OsTCP19** in Arabidopsis caused upregulation of IAA3, ABI3 and ABI4 and downregulation of LOX2, and led to developmental abnormalities like fewer lateral root formation.
   - **OsTCP19** influences developmental and abiotic stress signaling by modulating ABI4-mediated pathways.
   - Thus, **OsTCP19** appears to be an important node in cell signaling which crosslinks stress and developmental pathways.
   - Interactions of **OsTCP19** with OsABI4 and OsULT1 further suggest its function in modulation of abscisic acid pathways and chromatin structure.
   - Using a panel of diverse rice germplasm collected from different ecogeographical regions, we performed a genome-wide association study on the tillering response to nitrogen-the trait that is most closely correlated with nitrogen-use efficiency in rice-and identified **OsTCP19** as a modulator of this tillering response through its transcriptional response to nitrogen and its targeting to the tiller-promoting gene DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT)3,4.
   - A 29-bp insertion and/or deletion in the **OsTCP19** promoter confers a differential transcriptional response and variation in the tillering response to nitrogen among rice varieties.
   - The allele of **OsTCP19** associated with a high tillering response to nitrogen is prevalent in wild rice populations, but has largely been lost in modern cultivars: this loss correlates with increased local soil nitrogen content, which suggests that it might have contributed to geographical adaptation in rice.
