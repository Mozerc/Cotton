## Functional Descriptions:
   - The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase **TUD1** functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice.
   - In this study, we report a D1 genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (**TUD1**) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase.
   - Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotype of **TUD1** is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation and disorganized cell files in aerial organs.
   - Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that **TUD1** is epistatic to d1 and is less sensitive to BR treatment.
   - In the dsg1 mutant (an allelic mutant of **TUD1**), the lengths of the roots, internodes, panicles, and seeds were shorter than that in the wild-type, which was due to defects in cell division and elongation.
   - These results demonstrate that **DSG1** positively regulates cell division and elongation and may be involved in multiple hormone pathways.
   - The **DSG1** mutant is less sensitive to brassinosteroid treatment than the wild-type, and **DSG1** expression is negatively regulated by brassinosteroids, ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid.
   - These results indicate that less than half of **ELF1**-regulated genes in rice seedlings are affected by OsBRI1, and suggest that **ELF1** acts in a rice brassinosteroid signaling pathway different from that initiated by OsBRI1.
   - These results imply that **ELF1** suppresses stress-induced signalling, and that jasmonic acid signaling is stimulated in **ELF1**-1; therefore, **ELF1** may be involved in the brassinosteroid-mediated suppression of jasmonic acid response in rice.
   - Physiological analyses suggested that **ELF1**-1 is brassinosteroid-insensitive, so we hypothesized that **ELF1** encodes a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling.
   - Similarities in the phenotypes of **ELF1** and d61 mutants (mutants of brassinosteroid receptor gene OsBRI1), and in the regulation of **ELF1** and OsBRI1 expression, imply that **ELF1** functions as a positive regulator of brassinosteroid signaling in rice.
   - U-box proteins have been shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases; in fact, **ELF1** possessed E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro.
   - Here, by conducting yeast two-hybrid assay and in vitro ubiquitination experiments, we demonstrate that **ELF1** interacts with the OsWRKY4 transcription factor, a positive regulator of defense responses to rice sheath blight.
   - These results suggest that **ELF1** indirectly controls the expression of PR1b and PR5 genes by regulating the OsWRKY4 protein level, and support a hypothesis that brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid cooperate to maintain the balance between growth and defense responses.
   - **ELF1** decreased the stability of OsWRKY4, whereas exogenous jasmonic acid treatment suppressed this effect of **ELF1**, resulting in OsWRKY4 accumulation in rice plants.
   - We conclude that **ELF1** participates in the antagonistic interaction between these two phytohormones by suppressing the jasmonic acid response through the down-regulation of OsWRKY4 protein level in rice.
   - In addition, inhibition of BR synthesis promotes GSK2 accumulation and suppresses **TUD1** stability.
   - Furthermore, the GSK2 degradation process is largely impaired in **TUD1** in response to BR.
   - In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of **TUD1** in BR-induced GSK2 degradation, thereby advancing our understanding of a critical step in the BR signaling pathway of rice.
   - The U-box ubiquitin ligase **TUD1** promotes brassinosteroid-induced GSK2 degradation in rice.
   - Here, we identify the U-box ubiquitin ligase **TUD1** as a GSK2-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening.
