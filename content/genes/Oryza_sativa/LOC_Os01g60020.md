## Functional Descriptions:
   - We recently identified the **OsNAC4** gene, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor that exhibited rapid but transient transcriptional activation during the early stages of HR cell death.
   - Role of OsHSP90 and IREN, Ca2+ dependent nuclease, in plant hypersensitive cell death induced by transcription factor **OsNAC4**.
   - We report that overexpression of **OsNAC4**, which encodes a plant-specific transcription factor, leads to HR cell death accompanied by the loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear DNA fragmentation and typical morphological changes.
   - The transcription factor **OsNAC4** is a key positive regulator of plant hypersensitive cell death.
   - In **OsNAC4** knock-down lines, HR cell death is markedly decreased in response to avirulent bacterial strains.
   - A microarray analysis showed that the expression of 139 genes including OsHSP90 and IREN, encoding a Ca(2+)-dependent nuclease, were different between the **OsNAC4** knock-down line and control line during HR cell death.
   - Overexpression of **OsNAC4** in rice plants induced cell death accompanied by all characteristics of HR cell death: DNA fragmentation, loss of plasma membrane integrity, and protein degradation.
   - In **OsNAC4** RNAi knock-down lines exposed to an avirulent bacterial strain, the cellular response was characterized by a marked decrease in HR cell death compared to wild-type rice cells.
   - Here we report that although **OsNAC4** overexpression caused rapid protein degradation during HR cell death, neither IREN nor OsHSP90 were involved.
   - Thus, three important processes that accompany HR cell death are regulated by independent signaling pathways that are collectively induced by **OsNAC4**.
