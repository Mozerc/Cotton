## Functional Descriptions:
   - Notably, the expression of **OsHXK5**, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth.
   - Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsHXK5** or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the photosynthetic gene RbcS in response to Glc treatment.
   - Transient expression analyses using GFP fusion constructs revealed that **OsHXK5** and OsHXK6 are associated with mitochondria.
   - Interestingly, the **OsHXK5**DeltamTP-GFP and OsHXK6DeltamTP-GFP fusion proteins, which lack N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides, were present mainly in the nucleus with a small amount of the proteins seen in the cytosol.
   - In addition, the **OsHXK5**NLS-GFP and OsHXK6NLS-GFP fusion proteins harboring nuclear localization signals were targeted predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that these OsHXKs retain a dual-targeting ability to mitochondria and nuclei.
   - Sugars induced the expression of three OsHXKs, OsHXK2, **OsHXK5**, and OsHXK6, in excised leaves, while suppressing OsHXK7 expression in excised leaves and immature seeds.
   - Our results demonstrate that **OsHXK5** contributes to a large portion of the hexokinase activity necessary for the starch utilization pathway during pollen germination and tube growth, as well as for starch biosynthesis during pollen maturation.
   - We characterized hxk5-1, a Tos17 mutant of **OsHXK5** that is up-regulated in maturing pollen, a stage when starch accumulates.
