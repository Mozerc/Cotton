## Functional Descriptions:
   - We have reported previously that a transcription factor identified in rice, WRKY45 (**OsWRKY45**), plays a pivotal role in BTH-induced disease resistance by mediating SA signalling.
   - **OsWRKY45** alleles play different roles in abscisic acid signalling and salt stress tolerance but similar roles in drought and cold tolerance in rice.
   - Together, these results indicate that the **OsWRKY45** may be involved in the signal pathways of both biotic and abiotic stress response.
   - Over-expression of the stress-induced **OsWRKY45** enhances disease resistance and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis.
   - Here it is shown that the alleles **OsWRKY45**-1 and **OsWRKY45**-2 play different roles in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling and salt stress adaptation in rice.
   - **OsWRKY45**-1 transgenic plants showed no obvious difference from negative controls in response to salt stress.
   - In contrast, **OsWRKY45**-2-overexpressing lines showed increased ABA sensitivity and reduced salt stress tolerance, and **OsWRKY45**-2-suppressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt stress tolerance.
   - These results suggest that **OsWRKY45**-1 negatively and **OsWRKY45**-2 positively regulates ABA signalling and, in addition, **OsWRKY45**-2 but not **OsWRKY45**-1 negatively regulates rice response to salt stress.
   - **OsWRKY45**-1-overexpressing lines showed reduced ABA sensitivity, whereas **OsWRKY45**-1-knockout lines showed increased ABA sensitivity.
   - **OsWRKY45**-1-regulated Xoo resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of salicylic acid and jasmonic acid and induced expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes, while **OsWRKY45**-2-regulated Xoo resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of jasmonic acid but not salicylic acid and induced expression of another subset of defense-responsive genes.
   - **OsWRKY45**-1 and **OsWRKY45**-2 transgenic plants showed differential expression of a set of ABA- and abiotic stress-responsive genes, but they showed similar responses to cold and drought stresses.
   - The relationship between **OsWRKY45** expression and ABA signalling is discussed.
   - **OsWRKY45**-1-overexpressing plants showed increased susceptibility and **OsWRKY45**-1-knockout plants showed enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc.
   - In contrast, **OsWRKY45**-2-overexpressing plants showed enhanced resistance and **OsWRKY45**-2-suppressing plants showed increased susceptibility to Xoo and Xoc.
   - Interestingly, excessive **WRKY45** expression rendered rice plants sensitive to low temperature and salinity, and stress sensitivity was correlated with the induction of defence genes by these stresses.
   - Previously, we reported that rice transformants overexpressing **WRKY45** driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter were strongly resistant to both pathogens; however, their growth and yield were negatively affected because of the trade-off between the two conflicting traits.
   - Comparisons among different transformant lines showed that, overall, the strength of **WRKY45** expression was positively correlated with disease resistance and negatively correlated with agronomic traits.
   - The agronomic traits of two lines expressing **WRKY45** driven by the OsUbi7 promoter (PO sUbi7 lines) were nearly comparable to those of untransformed rice, and both lines were pathogen resistant.
   - The rice transcription factor **WRKY45** plays a central role in the salicylic acid signalling pathway and mediates chemical-induced resistance to multiple pathogens, including Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - **WRKY45** is an important transcription factor in the salicylic acid signalling pathway in rice that mediates chemical-induced resistance against multiple pathogens.
   - Here, a new strategy to confer rice with strong disease resistance without any negative effects on agronomic traits was established by expressing **WRKY45** under the control of pathogen-responsive promoters in combination with a translational enhancer derived from a 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of rice alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).
   - Thus, expressing **WRKY45** under the control of the PR1b promoter with the ADH 5'-UTR is an excellent strategy to develop disease-resistant rice, and the line established could serve as a mother line for breeding disease-resistant rice.
   - The activation of **WRKY45** by benzothiadiazole (BTH) was reduced under low temperature and high salinity, probably through abscisic acid (ABA) signalling.
   - Phosphorylation of **WRKY45**, the central transcription factor in salicylic-acid (SA)-signalling-dependent pathogen defence in rice, via the OsMKK10-2-OsMPK6 cascade, was required to fully activate **WRKY45**.
   - An ABA treatment dephosphorylated/inactivated OsMPK6 via protein tyrosine phosphatases, OsPTP1/2, leading to the impaired activation of **WRKY45** and a reduction in Magnaporthe oryzae resistance, even after BTH treatment.
   - Here we show that a TE-siRNA, TE-siR815, causes opposite functions for the two alleles, **WRKY45**-1 and **WRKY45**-2, of the **WRKY45** transcription factor in rice resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - These results suggest that TE-siR815 contributes to the natural variation of the **WRKY45** locus and TE-siR815-induced suppression of ST1 results in the negative role of **WRKY45**-1 but positive role of **WRKY45**-2 in regulating disease resistance.
   - The Transcription Factor **OsWRKY45** Negatively Modulates the Resistance of Rice to the Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens..
   - These findings suggest that **OsWRKY45** plays important but contrasting roles in regulating the resistance of rice to pathogens and herbivores, and attention should be paid if **OsWRKY45** is used to develop disease or herbivore-resistant rice.
   - The antisense expression of **OsWRKY45** (as-wrky) enhanced BPH-induced levels of ethylene, reduced feeding and oviposition preference as well as the survival rate of BPH, and delayed the development of BPH nymphs.
   - Mutation of **WRKY45** compromises the enhanced blast resistance and bacterial leaf blight resistance conferred by arf8 mutant.
