- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In addition, because the morphology and constitutive defense responses of **NLS1**-1D were not suppressed by blocking SA or NPR1 transcript accumulation, we suggest that **NLS1** mediates both SA and NPR1-independent defense signaling pathways in rice.
   - In this study, we characterized the semi-dominant mutant **NLS1**-1D (necrotic leaf sheath 1) of rice, which displays spontaneous lesions, specifically on leaf sheaths, with a developmental pattern.
   - **NLS1**-1D plants also exhibited constitutively activated defense responses, including extensive cell death, excess hydrogen peroxide and salicylic acid (SA) accumulation, up-regulated expressions of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced resistance to bacterial pathogens.
   - Semi-dominant mutations in the CC-NB-LRR-type R gene, **NLS1**, lead to constitutive activation of defense responses in rice.
