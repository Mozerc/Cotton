- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic lines with suppressed **OsSYT-5** gene expression exhibited higher pollen viability and produced more grains compared to the wild type at both normal and drought stress conditions.
   - Enhancement of drought tolerance in rice by silencing of the **OsSYT-5** gene..
   - In the water deficit experiment, the transgenic lines with a silenced **OsSYT-5** gene exhibited symptoms of drought stress seven days later than the wild type.
   - Transgenic lines with suppressed expression of the **OsSYT-5** gene exhibited an enhanced photosynthetic rate but reduced stomatal conductance and transpiration during water deficit stress.
   - The silencing of the **OsSYT-5** gene affected the expression of several genes associated with ABA-related stress signaling in the transgenic rice plants.
