## Functional Descriptions:
   - In agreement with this hypothesis, transgenic rice plants with a maize **SPS** gene that had about 3 times the **SPS** activity of that in Nipponbare (control plants) were significantly taller than Nipponbare from the early growth stage.
   - A rice genomic clone (**sps1**) coding for sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) was isolated and sequenced.
   - The promoter activities of sucrose phosphate synthase genes in rice, **OsSPS1** and **OsSPS1**1, are controlled by light and circadian clock, but not by sucrose.
   - The higher level of **SPS** transcripts and the activity of **SPS** in NIL6 compared to control plants, and the fact that the relative **SPS** activity per **SPS** protein content was almost the same between NIL6 and Nipponbare suggested that the higher plant height in NIL6 compared to Nipponbare was due to the high **SPS** activity in NIL6.
   - During leaf development, the **sps1** promoter directs a basipetal pattern of expression that coincides with the distribution of SPS activity during the leaf sink-to-source transition.
   - It was also found that during the vegetative part of the growth cycle, **SPS** expression and enzymatic activity are highest in the youngest fully expanded leaf.
   - Analysis of rice **sps1** expression showed that mRNA levels change during leaf development.
   - It was found that the expression of the rice **sps1** gene is limited to mesophyll cells in leaves, the scutellum of germinating seedlings, and pollen of immature inflorescences.
   - **SPS** plays a central role in the production of sucrose in photosynthetic cells and in the conversion of starch or fatty acids into sucrose in germinating seeds.
   - Our previous study on the expression of the sucrose phosphate synthase gene family in rice (Os**SPS**s) suggested the involvement of sucrose sensing and/or circadian rhythm in the transcriptional regulation of Os**SPS**.
   - **SPS** activity and mRNA were undetectable in roots.
   - In a double knockout mutant of **OsSPS1** and **OsSPS1**1 (sps1/sps11), an 84% reduction in leaf SPS activity resulted in higher starch accumulation in the leaves than in the wild-type leaves.
   - The knockdown and knockout mutants of **OsSPS1** showed a 29-46% reduction in SPS activity in the leaves, but the carbohydrate content in the leaves and plant growth were not significantly different from those of wild-type plants.
