## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g40784](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g40784)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0621300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0621300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsCER1,OsGL1-4,LTR1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsCER1** was highly expressed in the tapetum (stage 10) and bicellular pollen cells (stage 11).
   - Downregulation of **OsCER1** in rice led to sterility, and fewer amyloplasts within the mature pollen grains.
   - Furthermore, significantly altered levels of expression of genes involved in the pollen development were exhibited in the **OsCER1** knocked down plants.
   - These results indicate that **OsCER1** is critical for VLC alkanes biosynthesis, plastids differentiation, and pollen development.
   - **OsCER1** Plays a Pivotal Role in Very-Long-Chain Alkane Biosynthesis and Affects Plastid Development and Programmed Cell Death of Tapetum in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - In addition, the downregulation of **OsCER1** in rice caused delayed tapetal programmed cell death and abnormal development of plastids in the tapetal cells.
   - **OsGL1-4** is preferentially expressed in pollen and tapetal cells, and is required for the synthesis of very-long-chain alkanes.
   - Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis suggested the humidity-sensitive male sterility of **OsGL1-4** was probably due to a significant reduction in C25 and C27 alkanes.
   - **OsCER1** regulates humidity-sensitive genic male sterility through very-long-chain (VLC) alkane metabolism of tryphine in rice.
   - Phenotypic investigation of NPB and **LTR1** suggested that **LTR1** showed rumpled leaf with uneven distribution of bulliform cells and sclerenchyma cells, and disordered vascular bundles.
   - A decrease in seed-setting rate in **LTR1** led to decreased per-plant grain yield.
   - Moreover, **LTR1** was sensitive to salt stress, and **LTR1** was strongly induced by salt stress.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **LTR1** enhanced yield in rice and **LTR1** positively regulates salt stress by affecting water and ion homeostasis.
   - Map-based cloning of **LTR1** showed that there was a 2-bp deletion in the eighth exon of LOC_Os02g40784 in **LTR1**, resulting in a frameshift mutation and early termination of transcription.
