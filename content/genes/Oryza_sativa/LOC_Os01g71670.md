- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Northern analysis with a 3'-UTR gene-specific probe revealed that **OsGLN2** is expressed exclusively in the paleae and lemmas during flowering, and no expression of **OsGLN2** was detected in other tissues such as leaf blades, leaf sheaths, stems, nodes and roots in mature rice plants.
   - The **OsGLN2** gene is also expressed in germinating seeds, where its expression is predominant in endosperms rather than embryos.
   - We report here the isolation and characterization of a new endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (1,3-beta-GLU) cDNA, **OsGLN2**, that is expressed both in flowers and in germinating seeds of rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - This is the first report, to our knowledge, that **OsGLN2** encodes a 1,3-beta-GLU and is expressed specifically in paleae and lemmas during flowering and in germinating seeds, where its expression is enhanced by GA and suppressed by ABA.
   - Cloning, characterization and expression of **OsGLN2**, a rice endo-1,3-beta-glucanase gene regulated developmentally in flowers and hormonally in germinating seeds.
   - In de-embryonated rice half-seeds, addition of gibberellin A3 (GA) greatly enhanced expression of the **OsGLN2** gene, while the GA-induced gene expression was suppressed strongly by abscisic acid (ABA).
