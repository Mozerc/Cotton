## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsRRP** is preferentially expressed in stems of wild-type rice and is significantly down-regulated in an increased tillering dwarf mutant ext37.
   - The seedlings overexpressing **OsRNS4** had longer coleoptiles and first leaves than wild-type seedlings under red light (R) and far-red light (FR), suggesting negative regulation of **OsRNS4** in photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings.
   - Moreover, ABA-induced growth inhibition of rice seedlings was significantly increased in the **OsRNS4**-overexpression (**OsRNS4**-OX) lines compared with that in WT, suggesting that **OsRNS4** probably acts as a positive regulator in ABA responses in rice seedlings.
   - Here, we investigated the expression patterns and roles of an S-like RNase gene, **OsRNS4**, in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated responses and phytochrome-mediated light responses as well as salinity tolerance in rice.
   - In addition, our results demonstrate that **OsRNS4**-OX lines have enhanced tolerance to high salinity compared to WT.
   - Overexpression of an S-like ribonuclease gene, **OsRNS4**, confers enhanced tolerance to high salinity and hyposensitivity to phytochrome-mediated light signals in rice.
   - **OsRNS4** expression was regulated by salt, PEG and ABA.
