## Functional Descriptions:
   - The rice **OsDG2** encoding a glycine-rich protein is involved in the regulation of chloroplast development during early seedling stage.
   - KEY MESSAGE: **OsDG2** gene encoded a novel chloroplast-targeted GRP in rice.
   - Disruption of the **OsDG2** would lead to delayed greening phenotype and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
   - Subcellular localization results showed that **OsDG2** was targeted in chloroplasts.
   - In **OsDG2** mutant, the expression levels of most genes associated with chloroplast development were severely decreased in the 3rd leaves, but almost recovered to wild-type level in the 4th leaves.
   - Our findings indicated that the nuclear-encoded **OsDG2** plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage of rice.
   - In this study, we identified a rice GRP gene mutant named **OsDG2** (O ryza s ativa d elayed g reening 2), which exhibits delayed greening phenotype characterized as bright yellow leaves before the three-leaf stage and thereafter turns to normal green.
