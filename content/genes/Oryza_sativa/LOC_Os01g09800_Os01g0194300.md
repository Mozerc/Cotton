- **Gene Name:**

- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The antisense expression of **OsNPR1** (as-npr1), which reduced the expression of the gene by 50%, increased elicited levels of JA and ethylene (ET) as well as of expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an ACC synthase gene OsACS2.
   - **OsNPR1** negatively regulates herbivore-induced JA and ethylene signaling and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice.
   - Here, using suppressive substrate hybridization, we identified a NPR1 gene from rice, **OsNPR1**, and found that its expression levels were upregulated in response to infestation by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis and rice leaf folder (LF) Cnaphalocrocis medinalis, and to mechanical wounding and treatment with jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA).
   - Furthermore, two marker genes in defense signaling pathway, **OsNPR1** and OsPR1b, were constitutively expressed in OsWRKY71-overexpressing transgenic plants.
   - These results suggest that OsWRKY71 might function as a transcriptional regulator upstream of **OsNPR1** and OsPR1b in rice defense signaling pathways.
   - These effects were diminished by RNAi-knockdown of **OsNPR1** or WRKY45, the key regulators of the SA signaling pathway in rice, indicating that the effects of CK depend on these two regulators.
   - 1 and **NH1**, in the establishment of full basal resistance to rice blast.
   - **OsNPR1**/NH1, a rice homolog of NPR1 that is the key regulator of systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana, was shown to be involved in the resistance of rice to bacterial blight disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - Involvement of **OsNPR1**/NH1 in rice basal resistance to blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - In our study, three rice homologous genes, **OsNPR1**/NH1, OsNPR2/NH2 and OsNPR3, were found to be induced by rice bacterial blight Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - Over-expression of **OsNPR1** conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight, but also enhanced herbivore susceptibility in transgenic plants.
   - These results indicate that **NH1** may be involved in the regulation of SA in response to environmental changes.
   - Northern analysis shows that **NH1**ox rice spontaneously activates defense genes, contrasting with NPR1-overexpressing Arabidopsis, where defense genes are not activated until induction.
   - Different subcellular localizations of **OsNPR1** antagonistically regulated SA- and jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes, but not SA and JA levels, indicating that **OsNPR1** might mediate antagonistic cross-talk between the SA- and JA-dependent pathways in rice.
   - Wild-type **NH1**, but not a point mutant corresponding to npr1-1, interacts strongly with the rice transcription factor rTGA2.
   - The resistant plants showed increased expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning in the **NH1** (an Arabidopsis NPR1 orthologue)-involved defense signal transduction pathway.
   - However, when grown in growth chambers (GCs) under low light, **NH1**ox plants are dwarfed, indicating elevated sensitivity to light.
   - Greenhouse-grown **NH1**ox plants develop lesion-mimic spots on leaves at preflowering stage although no other developmental effects are observed.
   - Our results suggest that **OsNPR1** is an early responding gene in herbivore-induced defense and that plants can use it to activate a specific and appropriate defense response against invaders by modulating signaling pathways.
   - Functional analysis of rice NPR1-like genes reveals that **OsNPR1**/NH1 is the rice orthologue conferring disease resistance with enhanced herbivore susceptibility.
   - TGA transcription factors are well known to participate in NPR1/**NH1**-mediated defense signaling, which is crucial to systemic acquired resistance in plants.
   - However, the role of **OsNPR1**/NH1 in rice basal resistance to blast fungus M.
   - oryzae, thus providing new insights into the role of **OsNPR1** in rice disease resistance.
   - Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice **NH1**.
   - Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators **NH1**, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression.
   - These results revealed that **OsNPR1** is involved in rice basal resistance to the blast pathogen M.
   - The GC-grown **NH1**ox plants show much higher salicylic acid (SA) levels than the wild type, whereas greenhouse-grown **NH1**ox plants contain lower SA.
   - Expression of the rice gene **OsNPR1** is induced by salicylic acid (SA).
