## Functional Descriptions:
   - Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of **OsBMY4** and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance.
   - In this study, **OsBMY4** and OsISA3, the key β-amylase and debranching enzymes that control transient starch degradation in rice leaves, were co-overexpressed in rice in order to accelerate starch degradation efficiency and increase the sugar supply for sink organs.
   - Moreover, since the **OsBMY4** gene has not been characterized, we generated **OsBMY4** mutants using CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing, which helped to reveal the roles of β-amylase in rice yield and quality.
