## Functional Descriptions:
   - We previously identified a salt and drought stress-responsive TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein gene **ZFP252** from rice.
   - We found that overexpression of **ZFP252** in rice increased the amount of free proline and soluble sugars, elevated the expression of stress defense genes and enhanced rice tolerance to salt and drought stresses, as compared with **ZFP252** antisense and non-transgenic plants.
   - Our findings suggest that **ZFP252** plays an important role in rice response to salt and drought stresses and is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stresses.
   - Overexpression of a TFIIIA-type zinc finger protein gene **ZFP252** enhances drought and salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - These results indicated that the **RZF71** may play an important role in rice responses to salt and osmotic stresses as a transcription factor.
   - The semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay showed **RZF71** was strongly induced by high-salinity and 20% PEG6000 treatments, but not regulated by low temperature and ABA (abscisic acid) treatments.
   - The expression profiling showed that **RZF71** was constitutively expressed in roots, culms, leaves, and flowering spikes.
   - A rice zinc-finger protein gene, **RZF71**, encoding the C2H2-type zinc-finger transcription factor was isolated from rice.
