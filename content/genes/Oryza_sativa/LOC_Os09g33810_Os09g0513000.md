## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os09g33810](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os09g33810)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os09g0513000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os09g0513000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsBIANK1,XB25
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Moreover, the accumulation of **XB25** is induced by Xoo infection.
   - The downregulation of **XB25** results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21-mediated disease resistance at the adult stage.
   - Taken together, these results indicate that **XB25** is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance.
   - The XA21 binding protein **XB25** is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance.
   - Molecular characterization of rice **OsBIANK1**, encoding a plasma membrane-anchored ankyrin repeat protein, and its inducible expression in defense responses.
   - Expression of **OsBIANK1** was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical inducer capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice.
   - Our preliminary results confirm previous evidences that **OsBIANK1** may be involved in regulation of disease resistance response in rice.
   - In BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of **OsBIANK1** was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings.
