## Functional Descriptions:
   - A fusion gene (**OsEm**-GUS) consisting of the **OsEm** promoter and the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene was constructed and tested in a transient expression system, using protoplasts derived from a suspension-cultured line of rice cells, for activation by ABA and by co-transfection with an expression vector (35S-Osvp1) for the rice VP1 (OSVP1) cDNA.
   - The expression of **OsEm**-GUS was strongly (40- to 150-fold) activated by externally applied ABA and by over-expression of (OS)VP1.
   - Overexpression of **OsEm1** encoding a group I LEA protein confers enhanced drought tolerance in rice.
   - In an effort to identify rice genes responsible for drought tolerance, a drought-responsive gene **OsEm1** encoding a group I LEA protein, was chosen for this study.
   - In this study, we generated **OsEm1**-overexpressing rice plants to explore the function of **OsEm1** under drought conditions.
   - Our findings suggest that **OsEm1** is a positive regulator of drought tolerance and is potentially promising for engineering drought tolerance in rice.
   - Overexpression of **OsEm1** increases ABA sensitivity and enhances osmotic tolerance in rice.
   - **OsEm1** was shown at vegetative stages to be responsive to various abiotic stresses, including drought, salt, cold and the hormone ABA.
   - Compared with wild type, the **OsEm1**-overexpressing rice plants showed enhanced plant survival ratio at the vegetative stage; moreover, over expression of **OsEm1** in rice increased the expression of other LEA genes, including RAB16A, RAB16C, RAB21, and LEA3, likely protecting organ integrity against harsh environments.
