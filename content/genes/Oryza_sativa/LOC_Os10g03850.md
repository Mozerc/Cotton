## Functional Descriptions:
   - This study isolated a gene (**OsFbx352**) from rice encoding an F-box domain protein and characterized its role in seed germination.
   - The transcripts of **OsFbx352** were increased upon imbibition of rice seeds and the increase was markedly suppressed by glucose.
   - Germination of seeds with overexpression of **OsFbx352** was less suppressed by glucose than that of wild-type seeds, while glucose had greater inhibition for germination of seeds with knockdown of **OsFbx352** by RNA interference (RNAi) than that of wild-type seeds.
   - The differential response of germination of the transgenic and wild-type seeds to glucose may be accounted for by differences in ABA content among overexpressing, RNAi, and wild-type seeds such that overexpression of **OsFbx352** and knockdown of **OsFbx352** led to lower and higher ABA contents, respectively, than that of wild-type seeds in the presence of glucose.
   - These findings indicate that **OsFbx352** plays a regulatory role in the regulation of glucose-induced suppression of seed germination by targeting ABA metabolism.
   - A rice F-box gene, **OsFbx352**, is involved in glucose-delayed seed germination in rice.
   - Overexpression of **OsFbx352** led to a reduction in expression of genes responsible for ABA synthesis (OsNced2, OsNced3) and an increase in expression of genes encoding ABA catabolism (OsAba-ox2, OsAba-ox3) in the presence of glucose.
