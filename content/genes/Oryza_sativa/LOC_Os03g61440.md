- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0829900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0829900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsFWL4</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Real-time PCR analysis showed that **OsFWL4** expression was induced by CdCl2stress in rice seedlings.
   - 2-like&quot; (OsFWL) affects Cd resistance in yeast, and **OsFWL4** mediates the translocation of Cd from roots to shoots.
   - The Cd contents of OsFWL3-, -4-, -6- and -7-transformed Cd(II)-sensitive yeast mutant ycf1 cells were strongly decreased compared with those of empty vector, with the strongest resistance to Cd observed in cells expressing **OsFWL4**.
   - Evaluation of truncated and site-directed mutation derivatives revealed that the CCXXG motifs near the second transmembrane region of **OsFWL4** are involved in Cd resistance in yeast.
   - These results suggest that **OsFWL4** might act directly as a transporter and is involved in the translocation of Cd from roots to shoots in rice.
   - The rice &quot;fruit-weight 2.2-like&quot; gene family member **OsFWL4** is involved in the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots.
