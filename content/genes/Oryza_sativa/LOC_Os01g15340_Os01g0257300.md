## Functional Descriptions:
   - Constitutive expression of **OsRAA1** under the control of maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter resulted in phenotypes of reduced growth of primary root, increased number of adventitious roots and helix primary root, and delayed gravitropic response of roots in seedlings of rice (Oryza sativa), which are similar to the phenotypes of the wild-type plant treated with auxin.
   - Moreover, a colocalization assay has shown that **OsRAA1** is expressed predominantly at spindles during cell division.
   - Here, the **OsRAA1** (Oryza sativa Root Architecture Associated 1) gene has been characterized molecularly.
   - Data of in situ hybridization and **OsRAA1**::GUS transgenic plant showed that **OsRAA1** expressed specifically in the apical meristem, the elongation zone of root tip, steles of the branch zone, and the young lateral root.
   - With overexpression of **OsRAA1**, initiation and growth of adventitious root were more sensitive to treatment of auxin than those of the control plants, while their responses to 9-hydroxyfluorene-9-carboxylic acid in both transgenic line and wild type showed similar results.
   - These data suggested that **OsRAA1** as a new gene functions in the development of rice root systems, which are mediated by auxin.
   - A positive feedback regulation mechanism of **OsRAA1** to indole-3-acetic acid metabolism may be involved in rice root development in nature.
   - Overexpression of **OsRAA1** causes pleiotropic phenotypes in transgenic rice plants, including altered leaf, flower, and root development and root response to gravity.
   - The expression of **OsRAA1** in fission yeast also induced metaphase arrest, which is consistent with the fact that **OsRAA1** functions through a conserved mechanism of cell cycle regulation.
   - These results suggest that ubiquitination and proteasomic proteolysis are involved in **OsRAA1** degradation, which is essential for the onset of anaphase, and that **OsRAA1** may modulate root development mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a novel regulatory factor of the cell cycle.
   - **OsRAA1** constitutive expression also caused longer leaves and sterile florets at the last stage of plant development.
   - Previous studies have identified rice (Oryza sativa) ROOT ARCHITECTURE ASSOCIATED1 (**OsRAA1**) as a regulator in root development.
   - Here, we show that **OsRAA1**-overexpressed transgenic rice showed reduced primary root growth, increased numbers of cells in metaphase, and reduced numbers of cells in anaphase, which suggests that **OsRAA1** is responsible for limiting root growth by inhibiting the onset of anaphase.
   - Analysis of northern blot and GUS activity staining of **OsRAA1**::GUS transgenic plants demonstrated that the **OsRAA1** expression was induced by auxin.
