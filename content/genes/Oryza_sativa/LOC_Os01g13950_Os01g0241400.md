## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g13950](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g13950)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0241400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0241400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** PHS9
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The corresponding gene **PHS9** encodes a higher plant unique CC-type glutaredoxin and is specifically expressed in embryo at the late embryogenesis stage, implying that **PHS9** plays some roles in late stage of seed development.
   - **PHS9** or OsGAP overexpression plants showed reduced, while **PHS9** or OsGAP knockout mutant plants showed increased ABA sensitivity in seed germination, suggesting that **PHS9** and OsGAP acted as negative regulators in ABA signaling during seed germination.
   - Interestingly, the germination of **PHS9** and OsGAP overexpression or knockout plant seeds was weakly promoted by H2 O2 , implying that **PHS9** and OsGAP could affect the ROS signaling during seed germination.
   - Yeast two hybrid screening showed that **PHS9** could interact with OsGAP, which is an interaction partner of the ABA receptor OsRCAR1.
   - These results indicates that **PHS9** plays an important role in the regulation of rice PHS through integration of ROS signaling and ABA signaling.
