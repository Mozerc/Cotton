- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsPBP1** is a single copy gene and preferentially expressed in pistil and pollen but down-regulated by pollination.
   - Pollen grains of antisense **OsPBP1** transgenic lines were largely nonviable, germinated poorly in vitro and of low fertility.
   - **OsPBP1** protein was localized in a region peripheral to pollen wall and vesicles of elongating pollen tube, and its repressed expression reduced substantially this association and led to alteration of microfilament polymerization during pollen germination.
   - Taken together, these results indicate that **OsPBP1** is a novel functional C2-domain phospholipids-binding protein that is required for pollen fertility likely by regulating Ca(2+) and phospholipid signaling pathways.
   - A novel C2-domain phospholipid-binding protein, **OsPBP1**, is required for pollen fertility in rice.
