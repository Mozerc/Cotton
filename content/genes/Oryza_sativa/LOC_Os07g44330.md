## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g44330](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g44330)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0637300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0637300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsPDK1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsPDK1** was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined.
   - These results suggest that gibberellin modulates the activity of mtPDC by regulating **OsPDK1** expression and subsequently controlling plant growth and development.
   - Maximum expression of **OsPDK1** in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h.
   - The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp **OsPDK1** promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath.
   - **OsPDK1** was identified as a gibberellin-up-regulated gene using a cDNA microarray.
