## Functional Descriptions:
   - No correlation between sucrose synthase activity and starch biosynthesis was seen in these mutants, although slight elevations of **RSS1** transcript levels were observed.
   - We previously showed that the rice protein **RSS1**, whose stability is regulated depending on the cell cycle phases, is a key factor for the maintenance of meristematic activity under stressful conditions.
   - Molecular characterization of the rice protein **RSS1** required for meristematic activity under stressful conditions.
   - **RSS1** was expressed predominantly in the endosperm of milky stage rice seeds with maximum expression at 3~5 days after pollination which were 8~10-fold over leaf levels.
   - Cloning and expression of rice (Oryza sativa) sucrose synthase 1 (**RSS1**) in developing seed endosperm.
   - Here we show that **RSS1** interacts with all the PP1 expressed in the shoot apex of rice.
   - These effects of **RSS1** are exerted by regulating the G1-S transition, possibly through an interaction of **RSS1** with protein phosphatase 1, and are mediated by the phytohormone, cytokinin.
   - ) sucrose synthase 1 (**RSS1**) was used to determine spatial expression of the gene in rice tissues and temporal expression in developing rice endosperm.
   - Here we show that a rice protein, **RSS1**, whose stability is controlled by cell cycle phases, contributes to the vigour of meristematic cells and viability under salinity conditions.
   - **RSS1** regulates the cell cycle and maintains meristematic activity under stress conditions in rice.
   - Interestingly, the recombinant **RSS1** protein is highly resistant to heat with respect to its anti-coagulability and binding activity to PP1.
   - **RSS1** transcript and activity levels were analyzed in two starch deficient mutants of rice to determine if the lesion in these mutants resides at the locus for **RSS1**.
   - The wheat TdRL1 is the functional homolog of the rice **RSS1** and promotes plant salt stress tolerance.
   - Finally, when expressed in the rice **RSS1** mutant, TdRL1 suppressed its dwarf phenotype upon salt stress, confirming that both proteins are true functional homologs required for salt stress tolerance in cereals.
   - To further understand their function, we performed a computational analysis to compare **RSS1** and TdRL1 co-expression networks revealing common gene ontologies, among which those related to cell cycle progression and regulation of microtubule (MT) networks were over-represented.
