- **Gene Symbol:** OsARD,OsARD2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsARD**1 mRNA levels showed a rapid, early and transient increase upon submergence and after treatment with ethylene-releasing compounds.
   - Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the **OsARD** expression is regulated by abiotic stresses and phytohormones.
   - **OsARD**1 transcripts accumulated in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, indicating that **OsARD**1 is a primary ethylene response gene.
   - Promoter analysis suggests that immediate-early regulation of **OsARD**1 by ethylene may involve an EIN3-like transcription factor.
   - **OsARD**1 is induced by low levels of ethylene.
   - The immediate-early ethylene response gene **OsARD**1 encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine.
   - These results suggest that **OsARD** may play a role in the metabolism of methionine and ethylene in response to abiotic stresses.
   - **OsARD** was mainly expressed in roots under flood conditions.
