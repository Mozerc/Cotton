## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OsEXPA8** in rice plants yielded pleiotropic phenotypes of improved root system architecture (longer primary roots, more lateral roots and root hairs), increased plant height, enhanced leaf number and enlarged leaf size.
   - Further study indicated that the average cell length in both leaf and root vascular bundles was enhanced, and the cell growth in suspension cultures was increased, which revealed the cellular basis for **OsEXPA8**-mediated rice plant growth acceleration.
   - Overexpression of **OsEXPA8**, a root-specific gene, improves rice growth and root system architecture by facilitating cell extension.
   - Moreover, a prominent change in the wall polymer composition of suspension cells was observed, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra revealed a relative increase in the ratios of the polysaccharide/lignin content in cell wall compositions of **OsEXPA8** overexpressors.
   - In this work, we investigated the possible biological role of the root-specific alpha-expansin gene **OsEXPA8** in rice growth and development by generating transgenic plants.
   - Atomic force microscopy (AFM) technology revealed that average wall stiffness values for 35S::**OsEXPA8** transgenic suspension-cultured cells decreased over six-fold compared to wild-type counterparts during different growth phases.
