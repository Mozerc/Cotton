## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression level of OsCKX2 in the shoot apex of **DN1**-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that OsCKX2 does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets.
   - DN1 is allelic to DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1 (**DEP1**) (=qPE(9-1)).
   - Recently, **qPE9-1** has been successfully cloned; however, the genetic effect on grain yield per plant of the erect panicle allele **qPE9-1** is controversial yet.
   - The comparison of agronomic traits between the NILs showed that, when **qPE9-1** was replaced by **qPE9-1**, the panicle architecture was changed from drooping to erect; moreover, the panicle length, plant height, 1000-grain weight and the tillers were significantly decreased, consequently resulting in the dramatic decrease of grain yield per plant by 30%.
   - Therefore, we concluded that the **qPE9-1** was a major factor controlling panicle architecture, and **qPE9-1** had pleiotropic nature, with negative effects on grain yield per plant.
   - Introgression of **qPE9-1** allele, conferring the panicle erectness, leads to the decrease of grain yield per plant in japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - The **qPE9-1** gene has been proved to be widely used in high-yield rice cultivar developments, conferring erect panicle character in japonica rice.
   - In the present study, a drooping panicle parent Nongken 57, carrying **qPE9-1** allele, was used as recurrent parent to successively backcross to a typical erect panicle line from the double haploid (DH) population (Wuyunjing 8/Nongken 57), which was previously shown to carry **qPE9-1** allele.
   - This result strongly suggests that the erect panicle allele **qPE9-1** should be used together with other favorable genes in the high-yield breeding practice.
   - A comparison of the **DN1**-1 and **DN1**-3 alleles suggests that the N-terminal region of **DN1** contains a coiled-coil domain and a nuclear localization signal that might be responsible for semi-dwarfness.
   - A rice cDNA, **OsDEP1**, encoding a highly cysteine (Cys)-rich G protein gamma subunit, was initially identified as it conferred cadmium (Cd) tolerance on yeast cells.
   - Rice **DEP1**, encoding a highly cysteine-rich G protein gamma subunit, confers cadmium tolerance on yeast cells and plants.
   - Natural variation at the **DEP1** locus enhances grain yield in rice.
   - In addition, the **qPE9-1** locus regulates panicle and grain length, grain weight, and consequently grain yield.
   - **DN1**-1 plants have normal sensitivity to gibberellin, brassinolide, and kinetin, and we observed no genetic epistasis with brassinolide-related mutants, suggesting that **DN1** does not function in the signaling pathways of these phytohormones.
   - Here we report the map-based cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, **qPE9-1**, which plays an integral role in regulation of rice plant architecture including panicle erectness.
   - Phenotypic comparisons of a set of near-isogenic lines and transgenic lines reveal that the functional allele (**qPE9-1**) results in drooping panicles, and the loss-of-function mutation (**qPE9-1**) leads to more erect panicles.
   - We propose that the panicle erectness trait resulted from a natural random loss-of-function mutation for the **qPE9-1** gene and has subsequently been the target of artificial selection during japonica rice breeding.
   - Deletion in a quantitative trait gene **qPE9-1** associated with panicle erectness improves plant architecture during rice domestication.
   - In addition, we found that H90, the nearest marker to **qPE9-1**, used for genotyping 38 cultivars with extremely erect and drooping panicles, segregated in agreement with PC, suggesting the H90 product was possibly part of the **qPE9-1** gene or closely related to it.
   - We show that the rice DENSE PANICLE 1 (**DN1**) mutant allele **DN1**-1 causes both of these characteristics and that **DN1**-1 is a loss-of-function mutation.
   - These data demonstrated that H90 could be used for marker-aided selection for the PE trait in breeding and in the cloning of **qPE9-1**.
   - In order to improve the genetic diversity of **DEP1**, we used a rice germplasm collection of 72 high yielding japonica rice varieties to analyze the contribution of **DEP1** to the panicle traits.
   - The SNP (G/C) at the promoter region will contribute to the flexible application of **DEP1** in rice breeding.
   - **DEP1** is a G protein gamma subunit that is involved in the regulation of erect panicle, number of grains per panicle, nitrogen uptake, and stress-tolerance through the G protein signal pathway.
   - Here we review the development of erect panicle rice varieties, **DEP1** alleles and regulatory network, and its physiological and morphological functions.
   - Additionally, the further increasing the yield potential of erect-panicle super-rice, and the development of molecular designing breeding for indica-japonica hybrid rice with the **DEP1** gene are also prospected.
   - The **DEP1** (dense and erect panicle 1) gene, which corresponds to the erect panicle architecture, shows a pleiotropic effect in increasing grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice.
   - Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the carbon-nitrogen metabolic balance changes as the **DEP1** allele enhances nitrogen uptake and assimilation.
   - **DEP1** is involved in regulating the carbon-nitrogen metabolic balance to affect grain yield and quality in rice (Oriza sativa L.).
   - In this study, we generated transgenic Akitakomati plants by overexpressing **DEP1** and analyzed the carbon-nitrogen metabolic status, gene expression profiles, and grain yield and quality.
   - These results indicated that **DEP1** enhanced H2O2 biosynthesis and promoted the cell death of the root cortex, thus contributing to aerenchyma development in WYJ8(**DEP1**).
   - However, it is unclear whether **DEP1** regulates cell death for aerenchyma formation in rice roots.
