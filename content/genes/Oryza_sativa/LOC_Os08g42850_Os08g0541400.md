## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os08g42850](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os08g42850)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0541400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0541400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsFKBP16-3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic Arabidopsis and transgenic rice plants that constitutively expressed **OsFKBP16-3** exhibited increased tolerance to salinity, drought and oxidative stresses, but showed no change in growth or phenotype, compared with vector control plants, when grown under non-stressed conditions.
   - **OsFKBP16-3** was mainly expressed in rice leaf tissues and was upregulated by various abiotic stresses, including salt, drought, high light, hydrogen peroxide, heat and methyl viologen.
   - Here, we characterized rice **OsFKBP16-3** and examined the role of this gene in the regulation of abiotic stress in plants.
   - The chloroplast localization of **OsFKBP16-3**-GFP was confirmed through the transient expression of **OsFKBP16-3** in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves.
