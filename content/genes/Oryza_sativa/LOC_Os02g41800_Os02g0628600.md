## Functional Descriptions:
   - It was also shown that expression of OsGH3-2, an rice IAA-conjugating enzyme, was positively regulated by **ARF8**.
   - MicroRNA167 (miR167) was shown to cleave auxin responsive factor 8 (**ARF8**) mRNA in cultured rice cells.
   - When cells grew in auxin-free medium, miR167 level decreased, resulting in an increase in the level of **ARF8** mRNA.
   - This study provides an evidence in which the exogeneous auxin signal is transduced to OsGH3-2 through miR167 and **ARF8** in sequence.
   - This proposed auxin signal transduction pathway, auxin-miR167-**ARF8**-OsGH3-2, could be, in conjunction with the other microRNA-mediated auxin signals, an important one for responding to exogeneous auxin and for determining the cellular free auxin level which guides appropriate auxin responses.

   - Mutation of WRKY45 compromises the enhanced blast resistance and bacterial leaf blight resistance conferred by **ARF8** mutant.
   - miR160a enhances disease resistance partially by suppressing **ARF8**, as mutation of **ARF8** in MIM160 background partially restores the compromised resistance resulting from MIM160.
   - **ARF8** protein binds directly to the promoter and suppresses the expression of WRKY45, which acts as a positive regulator of rice immunity.
