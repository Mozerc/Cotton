## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g49380](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g49380)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0700700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0700700)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsLOX1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsLOX1** transcripts were detected at low abundance in immature seeds and newly germinated seedlings, but accumulate rapidly and transiently in response to wounding or brown planthopper (BPH) attack, reaching a peak 3 h after wounding and 6 h after insect feeding.
   - In all of the antisense lines and more than half of the sense lines the expression levels of **OsLOX1**, the levels of enzyme activity, and the levels of the endogenous **OsLOX1** products (jasmonic acid, (Z)-3-hexenal and colneleic acid) at 6, 48, and 48 h after BPH feeding respectively, were below the levels found in non-transgenic control plants; yet, the levels in the remaining sense transformants were enhanced relative to controls.
   - We produced transgenic rice lines carrying either sense or antisense constructs under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, and these rice lines showed altered **OsLOX1** activity.
   - Transformants with a lower level of **OsLOX1** expression were less able to tolerate BPH attack, while those with enhanced **OsLOX1** expression were more resistant.
   - **OsLOX1** is a novel full-length cDNA isolated from developing rice seeds.
