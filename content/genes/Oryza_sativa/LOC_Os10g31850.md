- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0456800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0456800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** DCA1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DCA1** Acts as a Transcriptional Co-activator of DST and Contributes to Drought and Salt Tolerance in Rice.
   - Downregulation of **DCA1** significantly enhanced drought and salt tolerance in rice, and overexpression of **DCA1** increased sensitivity to stress treatment.
   - Moreover, due to the evolutionary and functional conservation of **DCA1** and DST in plants, engineering of this pathway has the potential to improve tolerance to abiotic stress in other important crop species.
   - These phenotypes were mainly influenced by **DCA1** and negatively regulated stomatal closure through the direct modulation of genes associated with H2O2 homeostasis.
