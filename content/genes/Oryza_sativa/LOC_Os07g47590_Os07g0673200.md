## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we found that the Oryza sativa (rice) ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana Nitrogen Limitation Adaptation (NLA), **OsNLA1** protein, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-ligase, was predominantly localized in the plasma membrane, and could interact with rice phosphate transporters OsPT2 and OsPT8.
   - Overexpression of **OsNLA1** or repression of OsPT2/PT8 restored the high leaf Pi concentration in **OsNLA1** mutants to a level similar to that of wild type plants.
   - Our results show that **OsNLA1** is involved in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice by mediating the degradation of OsPT2 and OsPT8, and **OsNLA1** differs from the ortholog in Arabidopsis in several aspects.
   - Mutation in **OsNLA1** (**OsNLA1**) led to significant increase of Pi concentration in leaves in a nitrate-independent manner.
   - In contrast to what has been observed in Arabidopsis, the transcript abundance of **OsNLA1** did not decrease under Pi limited conditions or in OsmiR827 (microRNA827)- or OsPHR2 (PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 2)-overexpressing transgenic lines.
   - When grown under limiting nitrate levels, **OsNLA1** transgenic lines also displayed a similar pattern in Pi accumulation and Pi toxicity symptoms compared to wild-type suggesting an existence of cross-talk between nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), which is regulated by **OsNLA1**.
   - When grown under sufficient Pi and nitrate levels, **OsNLA1** knockdown (**OsNLA1**-1, **OsNLA1**-2, and **OsNLA1**-3) lines accumulated higher Pi content in their shoot tissues compared to wild-type, whereas, over-expression lines (**OsNLA1**-OE1, **OsNLA1**-OE2, and **OsNLA1**-OE3) accumulated the least levels of Pi.
   - Taken together, these results show that **OsNLA1** is involved in Pi homeostasis regulating Pi uptake and accumulation in rice plants and may provide an opportunity to enhance P use efficiency by manipulating nitrate supply in the soil.
   - Altered Expression of **OsNLA1** Modulates Pi Accumulation in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Plants..
   - Moreover, **OsNLA1** was also found to interact with OsPHO2, a known regulator of Pi homeostasis, in a Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) assay.
   - In this study, by using transgenic approaches, we have revealed the critical role of **OsNLA1** in phosphate (Pi) accumulation of rice plants.
   - Loss-of-function of **OsNLA1** caused P overaccumulation and growth inhibitions in both root and shoot under Pi-sufficient condition.
   - Furthermore, mutation of **OsNLA1** affected expression of Pi tranporters and root hair development under Pi-sufficient and/or Pi-deficient conditions.
   - **OsNLA1** plays a key role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice.
   - Characterization of the rice NLA family reveals a key role for **OsNLA1** in phosphate homeostasis..
   - Combining **OsNLA1** mutation with OsPT8 overexpression resulted in As(V) hypersensitivity, As hyperaccumulation, and higher shoot to root ratio of As in rice.
   - The role of **OsNLA1** in regulating arsenate uptake and tolerance in rice..
   - In this study, the role of **OsNLA1** in arsenate uptake and tolerance in rice was analyzed.
   - **OsNLA1** expression was induced in response to As(V) stress.
   - The **OsNLA1** mutant was more sensitive to As(V) stress than those of the wild type (WT).
   - These results indicated that **OsNLA1** plays an important role in arsenate uptake and tolerance, mainly via regulating the amount of Pi transporters.
   - **OsNLA1** promoter activity was observed in roots, ligules, leaves, sheaths, pollen grains, and surrounding the vascular tissues of anthers, suggesting that **OsNLA1** is important throughout the development of rice.
   - Disruption of **OsNLA1** resulted in increased Pi uptake from roots as well as impaired pollen development and reduced grain production.
   - In summary, our study reveals that Pi-induced **OsNLA1** expression regulated by a unique mechanism functions in Pi acquisition, Pi translocation, and reproductive success.
   - uORF and Phosphate-Regulated Expression of Rice **OsNLA1** Controls Phosphate Transport and Reproduction..
   - Rice (Oryza sativa) **OsNLA1** has been proposed to play a crucial role in regulating phosphate (Pi) acquisition in roots, similar to that of Arabidopsis AtNLA.
   - However, unlike AtNLA, **OsNLA1** is not a target of miR827, a Pi starvation-induced miRNA.
   - It is, therefore, of interest to know whether the expression of **OsNLA1** depends on Pi supply and how it is regulated.
   - In this study, we provide evidence that **OsNLA1** controls Pi acquisition by directing the degradation of several OsPHT1 Pi transporters (i.
