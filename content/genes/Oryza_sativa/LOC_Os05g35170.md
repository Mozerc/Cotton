## Functional Descriptions:
   - We identified a novel transcription factor of rice and barley, **IDEF2**, which specifically binds to the iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element 2 (IDE2) by yeast one-hybrid screening.
   - **IDEF2** belongs to an uncharacterized branch of the NAC transcription factor family and exhibits novel properties of sequence recognition.
   - A novel NAC transcription factor, **IDEF2**, that recognizes the iron deficiency-responsive element 2 regulates the genes involved in iron homeostasis in plants.
   - **IDEF2** transcripts are constitutively present in rice roots and leaves.
   - **IDEF2** was expressed in pollen, ovaries and the dorsal vascular region of the endosperm.
   - During seed germination, IDEF1 and **IDEF2** were expressed in the endosperm and embryo.
   - IDEF1 and **IDEF2** expression was dominant in leaf mesophyll and vascular cells, respectively.
   - The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors IDEF1 and **IDEF2**.
   - KEY RESULTS: IDEF1 and **IDEF2** were highly expressed in the basal parts of the lateral roots and vascular bundles.
   - The iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element binding factors 1 and 2 (IDEF1 and **IDEF2**) regulate transcriptional response to iron deficiency in rice roots.
   - The spatial expression patterns and gene regulation of IDEF1 and **IDEF2** in roots are generally conserved under conditions of iron sufficiency and deficiency, suggesting complicated interactions with unknown factors for sensing and transmitting iron-deficiency signals.
   - CONCLUSIONS: IDEF1 and **IDEF2** are constitutively expressed during both vegetative and reproductive stages.
   - Several genes up-regulated by iron deficiency, including the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2, were less induced by iron deficiency in the RNAi rice of **IDEF2**, suggesting that **IDEF2** is involved in the regulation of these genes.
   - Expression patterns of the target genes of IDEF1 and **IDEF2** were analysed using transformants with induced or repressed expression of IDEF1 or **IDEF2** grown in iron-rich or in iron-deficient solutions for 1 d.
   - In addition, the expression patterns of **IDEF2** target genes were similar between iron-rich conditions and early or subsequent iron deficiency.
   - Repression of the function of **IDEF2** by the RNA interference (RNAi) technique and chimeric repressor gene-silencing technology (CRES-T) caused aberrant iron homeostasis in rice.
