## Functional Descriptions:
   - Mutation in **OsNIP2;1** (Lsi1, a silicon influx transporter) significantly decreases arsenite uptake.
   - The rice (Oryza sativa) silicon transporter Lsi1 (**OsNIP2;1**, an aquaporin channel) is the major entry route of arsenite into rice roots.
   - Recently, a gene (Low silicon rice1 [**Lsi1**]) encoding a Si transporter was identified in rice roots.
   - Consistent with the Si uptake pattern, **Lsi1** expression and distribution of the **Lsi1** protein were found only in the basal zone of roots.
   - In the basal zones of the seminal, crown, and lateral roots, the **Lsi1** protein showed a polar localization at the distal side of both the exodermis and endodermis, where the Casparian bands are formed.
   - Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, **Lsi1** (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier).
   - The results demonstrate that **Lsi1** mediates the uptake of undissociated methylated As in rice roots.
   - Herein, we show evidence that the uptake of selenite, a main bioavailable form of Se in paddy soils, is mediated by a silicon (Si) influx transporter Lsi1 (**OsNIP2;1**) in rice.
   - Immunostaining with **Lsi1** and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; **Lsi1** and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots.
   - Whether **Lsi1** also mediates arsenite efflux was investigated.
   - *Expression of **Lsi1** in Xenopus laevis oocytes enhanced arsenite efflux, indicating that **Lsi1** facilitates arsenite transport bidirectionally.
   - A rice mutant defective in **Lsi1** (**Lsi1**) extruded significantly less arsenite than the wild-type rice and, as a result, accumulated more arsenite in the roots.
   - *We conclude that **Lsi1** plays a role in arsenite efflux in rice roots exposed to arsenate.
   - The role of the rice aquaporin **Lsi1** in arsenite efflux from roots.
   - A gene, **Lsi1**, that encodes a silicon influx transporter has been identified in rice.
   - Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to **Lsi1**.
   - Involvement of silicon influx transporter **OsNIP2;1** in selenite uptake in rice.
   - Mutation in Lsi2 had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than **Lsi1**.
   - Spatial distribution and temporal variation of the rice silicon transporter **Lsi1**.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that Si influx transporter **OsNIP2;1** is permeable to selenite.
   - The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [**Lsi1**] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath.
   - Here we describe the Low silicon rice 1 (**Lsi1**) gene, which controls silicon accumulation in rice, a typical silicon-accumulating plant.
   - Suppression of **Lsi1** expression resulted in reduced silicon uptake.
   - Furthermore, expression of **Lsi1** in Xenopus oocytes showed transport activity for silicon only.
   - Defect of **OsNIP2;1** resulted in a significant decrease in the Se concentration of the shoots and xylem sap when selenite was given.
   - There was a negative correlation between the expression level of **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions.
   - A split root experiment showed that the expression of both **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half roots were exposed to Si.
   - In conclusion, the Si-induced down-regulation of Si transporter genes is controlled by shoot Si, not root Si, and that the region between -327 to -292 in the **OsLsi1** promoter is involved in this regulation of **OsLsi1** expression in rice.
   - A split root experiment showed that the expression of both **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half of the roots were exposed to Si.
   - In conclusion, the Si-induced down-regulation of Si transporter genes is controlled by shoot Si, not root Si, and the region between -327 and -292 in the **OsLsi1** promoter is involved in this regulation of **OsLsi1** expression in rice.
   - Our results suggest that when overexpressed **Lsi1** in cold-sensitive rice, it possibility regulates the transcription factor OsWRKY53 in addition to the genes involved in the ROS metabolism, thus mediating resistance to chilling stress.
   - Overexpression of **Lsi1** in cold-sensitive rice mediates transcriptional regulatory networks and enhances resistance to chilling stress.
   - Our results demonstrate that **Lsi1** overexpression or interference causes changes in both miRNA expression and antioxidant capacity in rice, and therefore modulates rice tolerance to UV-B radiation.
   - In rice, the accumulation of Si is controlled by the low silicon rice 1 (**Lsi1**) gene; overexpression of **Lsi1** (**Lsi1**-OX) increases Si uptake and accumulation, while the reverse is observed in **Lsi1**-RNA interference (**Lsi1**-RNAi) transgenic rice.
   - Furthermore, the cellular localization of **OsLsi1** was altered; **OsLsi1** localized at the root exodermis of the wild-type rice was changed to be localized to other cell layers of the mutant roots.
   - The expression level of some transporter genes including **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice.
   - Root silicon deposition and its resultant reduction of sodium bypass flow is modulated by **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 in rice.
   - In summary, our results reveal that Si deposition at root endodermis and its resultant reduction of Na+ bypass flow is modulated by **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 and regulated by the expression of **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2, implying that root Si deposition could be an active and physiologically-regulated process in rice.
   - In this study, we investigated the roles of **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 in Si-induced reduction of bypass flow and its resultant alleviation of salt stress by using lsi1 and lsi2 mutants (defective in **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2, respectively) and their wild types (WTs).
   - When **OsLsi1** was ectopically expressed in the shoots, it showed polar localization at the xylem parenchyma cells of the basal node and leaf sheath, but not at the phloem companion cells.
   - The polar localization of both **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 was not altered by Si supply, but their protein abundance was reduced.
   - The polar localization of **OsLsi1** and OsLsi2 was not altered by inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by dominant-negative induction of dynamin-related protein1A and knockout of mu subunit of adaptor protein 2 complex, although the knockout mutants of OsAP2M gene showed dwarf phenotype.
