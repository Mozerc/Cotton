## Functional Descriptions:
   - Conversely, **OsCDPK11** protein levels were high at the beginning of seed development, but fell rapidly from 10 DAF onwards.
   - Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms OsCDPK2 and **OsCDPK11** show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development.
   - **OsCDPK13** accumulated in 2-week-old leaf sheath and callus, and became phosphorylated in response to cold and gibberellin (GA).
   - **OsCDPK13**, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene from rice, is induced by cold and gibberellin in rice leaf sheath.
   - **OsCDPK13**, a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene from rice, is induced in response to cold and gibberellin.
   - Furthermore, **OsCDPK13** gene expression and protein accumulation were enhanced in response to cold, but suppressed under salt and drought stresses.
   - OSCPK2 and **OsCPK11** cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20].
   - Recently, a full-length cDNA encoding **OsCDPK13** from rice seedling was isolated.
   - The results suggest that **OsCDPK13** might be an important signaling component in the response of rice to GA and cold stress.
   - Antisense **OsCDPK13** transgenic rice lines were shorter than the vector control lines, and the expression of **OsCDPK13** was lower in dwarf mutants of rice than in wild type.
   - OSCPK2 and **OsCPK11** mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles.
   - OsCDPK2 and **OsCDPK11** mRNA and protein levels increased in unison during flower development.
   - Sense **OsCDPK13** transgenic rice lines had higher recovery rates after cold stress than vector control rice.
   - Overexpression of a constitutively active truncated form of **OsCDPK1** confers disease resistance by affecting OsPR10a expression in rice.
   - These results suggest that **OsCDPK1** may be an upstream regulator involved in rice innate immunity and conferred broad-spectrum of disease resistance.
   - The dihybrid rice Ri-1/OsPR10a-Ox not only bypassed the effect of **OsCDPK1** silencing on the susceptibility to Xoo but also showed enhanced disease resistance and, consistent with Ri-1 phenotypes, increased plant height and grain size.
   - Our results reveal that **OsCDPK1** plays novel key roles in the cross-talk and mediation of the balance between stress response and development and provides a clue for improving grain yield and disease resistance simultaneously in rice.
   - OsPR10a and **OsCDPK1** showed corresponding expression patterns and were up-regulated in response to the jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and Xoo treatments, and OsPR1 and OsPR4 were significantly up-regulated in OEtr-1.
   - In the study presented here, we propose a model in which **OsCDPK1** plays key roles in negatively controlling the grain size, amylose content, and endosperm appearance, and also affects the physicochemical properties of the starch.
   - Overexpression of a constitutively active truncated form of **OsCDPK1** (OEtr) in rice produced smaller seeds, but a double-stranded RNA gene-silenced form of **OsCDPK1** (Ri) yielded larger seeds, suggesting that **OsCDPK1** plays a functional role in rice seed development.
   - This demonstrates that **OsCDPK1** plays a novel functional role in starch biosynthesis during seed development and affects the transparent appearance of the endosperm.
   - Effects of **OsCDPK1** on the Structure and Physicochemical Properties of Starch in Developing Rice Seeds.
   - We show that OsFBX257 can bind the kinases **OsCDPK1** and OsSAPK2, and that its phosphorylation can be reversed by phosphatase OsPP2C08.
