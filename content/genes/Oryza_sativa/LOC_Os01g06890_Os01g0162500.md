## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g06890](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g06890)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0162500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0162500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsKEAP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The downregulation of **OsKEAP1** increased the levels of H2O2, malondialdehyde, and proline while significantly decreasing the expression of two catalase genes in seedlings grown under normal and salt-stressed conditions.
   - The **OsKEAP1** mutations greatly impaired plant growth and development, resulting in significant declines in a majority of agronomic and yield-related traits, i.
   - In silico analysis showed that **OsKEAP1** has a Kelch-repeat domain which is identical to those of animals and a plant-specific development and cell death (DCD) domain in place of the broad-complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac (BTB) domain found in animals.
   - **OsKEAP1** was proven to be localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, in contrast to the exclusive cytoplasm localization of animal KEAP1.
