## Functional Descriptions:
   - In addition, expression of **GD1** was induced under sugar treatment, and the contents of starch and soluble sugar are altered in the **GD1** mutant.
   - In addition to the severe germination defect, the **GD1** mutant also shows a dwarf phenotype and abnormal flower development.
   - These data indicate that **GD1** participates directly or indirectly in regulating GA and carbohydrate homeostasis, and further regulates rice seed germination and seedling development.
   - To understand seed development and seed germination in cereals, a large-scale screen was performed using our T-DNA mutant population, and a mutant germination-defective1 (**GD1**) was identified.
   - Furthermore, **GD1** binds to the promoter of OsLFL1, a LEC2/FUS3-like gene of rice, via an RY element, leading to significant up-regulation of OsLFL1 and a large subset of seed maturation genes in the **GD1** mutant.
   - Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of **GD1**, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in **GD1**, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level.
   - Exogenous application of GA not only induced **GD1** expression, but also partially rescued the dwarf phenotype of **GD1**.
   - Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that **GD1** encodes a B3 domain-containing transcription factor with repression activity.
