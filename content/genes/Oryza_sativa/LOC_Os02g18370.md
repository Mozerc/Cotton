## Functional Descriptions:
   - Consistent with its thermosensitive phenotype, **TAP** expression is induced by high temperature.
   - **TAP** directly promotes the expression of OsYABBY3 (OsYAB3), OsYAB4, and OsYAB5, which encode key transcriptional regulators in panicle and spikelet development.
   - In addition, **TAP** physically interacts with OsYAB4 and OsYAB5 proteins; phenotypic analysis of osyab4 **TAP**-1 and osyab5 **TAP**-1 double mutants indicates that **TAP**-OsYAB4/OsYAB5 complexes act to maintain normal panicle and spikelet development.
   - The **TAP** mutants display high temperature-dependent reproductive abnormalities, including compromised secondary branch and spikelet initiation and pleiotropic floral organ defects.
   - We isolated a Poaceae-specific FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYLS3 (FHY3)/FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1)family transcription factor, Thermo-sensitive Spikelet Defects 1 (**TSD1**), derived from transposase in rice (Oryza sativa) **TSD1** was highly expressed in spikelets, induced by heat, and specifically enhanced the thermotolerance of spikelet morphogenesis.
   - Disrupting **TSD1** did not affect vegetative growth but markedly retarded spikelet initiation and development, as well as caused varying degrees of spikelet degeneration, depending on the temperature.
   - Most **TSD1** spikelets were normal at low temperature but gradually degenerated as temperature increased, and all disappeared at high temperature, leading to naked branches.
   - Notably, the knockout mutant yab5-ko and double mutant **TSD1** yab5-ko resembled **TSD1** in spikelet appearance and response to temperature, indicating that these genes likely participate in spikelet development through the cooperative **TSD1**-YABBY module.
   - These YABBY proteins can form either homodimers or heterodimers and play an important role in spikelet morphogenesis, similar to **TSD1**.
