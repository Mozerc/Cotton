- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0431200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0431200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsDRF1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **OsDRF1** was induced upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical inducer of defense responses in rice.
   - Overexpression of **OsDRF1** in transgenic tobacco resulted in enhanced disease resistance against tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) and Pseudomonas syringae pv.
   - The results suggest that **OsDRF1** plays a role in disease resistance via upregulating defense-related gene expression and that **OsDRF1** may also be involved in the response to ABA.
   - Overexpression of a rice defense-related F-box protein gene **OsDRF1** in tobacco improves disease resistance through potentiation of defense gene expression.
   - A rice defense-related F-box protein gene, **OsDRF1**, was cloned and identified during a course of study aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of induced immunity in rice.
   - Moreover, in BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of **OsDRF1** was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, compared with those in water-treated seedlings.
   - **OsDRF1** was also upregulated in rice seedlings after treatment with ABA.
   - Root elongation of the **OsDRF1**-overexpressing transgenic seedlings was significantly inhibited by ABA, indicating that overexpression of **OsDRF1** resulted in increased ABA sensitivity.
