## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g53650](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g53650)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0738400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0738400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsC3H10
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsC3H10** is predominantly expressed in seeds, and its expression levels rapidly declined during seed imbibition.
   - Root-specific overexpression of **OsC3H10** was insufficient to induce drought tolerance, while the overexpression of **OsC3H10** throughout the entire plant enhanced the drought tolerance of rice plants.
   - Our results demonstrated that **OsC3H10** is involved in the regulation of the drought tolerance pathway by modulating the expression of stress-related genes.
   - The expression of **OsC3H10** was induced by drought, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA).
   - Subcellular localization analysis revealed that **OsC3H10** localized not only in the nucleus but also to the processing bodies and stress granules upon stress treatment.
   - Transcriptome analysis revealed that **OsC3H10** overexpression elevated the expression levels of genes involved in stress responses, including LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEINs (LEAs), PATHOGENESIS RELATED GENEs (PRs) and GERMIN-LIKE PROTEINs (GLPs).
