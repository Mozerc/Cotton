## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g57220](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g57220)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0786100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0786100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** GLO1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Silencing of **GLO1** results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression.
   - We previously described identification of rice **GLO1** that interacts with a glutaredoxin protein, which in turn interacts with TGA transcription factors.
   - **GLO1** and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root.
   - Constitutive silencing of **GLO1** leads to programmed cell death, resulting in a lesion-mimic phenotype and lethality or reduced plant growth and development, consistent with previous reports.
