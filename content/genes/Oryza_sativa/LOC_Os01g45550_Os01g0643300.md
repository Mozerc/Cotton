## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OsPIN3t** led to improved drought tolerance, and GUS activity significantly increased when **OsPIN3t**pro::GUS plants were subjected to 20% polyethylene glycol stress.
   - Moreover, knockdown of **OsPIN3t** caused crown root abnormalities in the seedling stage that could be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with NPA, which indicated that **OsPIN3t** is involved in the control of polar auxin transport.
   - In this study, we identify a putative auxin efflux carrier gene in rice, **OsPIN3t**, which acts in auxin polar transport but is also involved in the drought stress response in rice.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that **OsPIN3t** is involved in auxin transport and the drought stress response, which suggests that a polar auxin transport pathway is involved in the regulation of the response to water stress in plants.
   - The putative auxin efflux carrier **OsPIN3t** is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance.
   - Transcriptome analysis of rice seedlings treated with SA revealed that the **OsPIN3t** auxin transporter is at the center of a GRN involving the coat protein clathrin.
   - Salicylic acid inhibits rice endocytic protein trafficking mediated by **OsPIN3t** and clathrin to affect root growth..
   - SA inhibitory effect on the endocytosis of **OsPIN3t** was dependent on clathrin; however, the root growth and endocytic trafficking mediated by tyrphostin A23 (TyrA23) were independent of the pin3t mutant under SA treatment.
