## Functional Descriptions:
   - OsPP2C50 and **OsPP2C53** is major negative regulators of ABA signaling regarding stomata closing in rice.
   - We identified that only OsPP2C50 and **OsPP2C53** among 9 OsPP2CAs might be related with stomatal closure/opening signaling based on guard cell specific expression and subcellular localization.
   - Transgenic rice overexpressing OsPP2C50 and **OsPP2C53** showed significantly higher water loss than control.
   - Overexpression of **OsABIL2** not only led to the ABA insensitivity, but also significantly altered plant developmental phenotypes, including stomata density and root architecture, which likely caused the hypersensitivity to drought stress.
   - Taken together, this study provides significant insights into rice ABA signaling and indicates the important role of **OsABIL2** in regulating root development.
   - Furthermore, **OsABIL2** interacts with and co-localized with OsPYL1 mainly in the cytosol, and ABA treatment regulates the nucleus-cytosol distribution of **OsABIL2**, suggesting a different mechanism for the activation of ABA signaling.
   - However, unlike many other solely nucleus-localized clade A PP2Cs, the **OsABIL2** is localized in both nucleus and cytosol.
   - Transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 (Stress/ABA-activated protein kinase 10) had longer root hairs; rice plants overexpressing **OsABIL2** (OsABI-Like 2) had attenuated ABA signaling and shorter root hairs, suggesting that the effect of ABA on root hair elongation depends on the conserved PYR/PP2C/SnRK2 ABA signaling module.
   - A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that the interaction between **OsABIL2** and a putative rice ABA receptor, OsPYL1, was ABA-dependent, and the interaction was lost with amino acid substitution from glycine to aspartic acid at the 183rd amino acid of the **OsABIL2** protein, corresponding to abi1-1 mutation.
   - The constitutive expression of **OsABIL2** or **OsABIL2**G183D in Arabidopsis or rice decreased ABA sensitivity to differing degrees.
   - These results indicated that the introduction of abi1-1 type dominant mutation was also effective in **OsABIL2** at decreasing ABA sensitivity in plants, and the attenuation of ABA sensitivity could be an alternative parameter to improve rice performance under low temperatures.
