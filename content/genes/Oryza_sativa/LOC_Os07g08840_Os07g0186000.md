## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g08840](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g08840)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0186000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0186000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsTrx23,OsTRXh1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The knockdown of **OsTRXh1** results in dwarf plants with fewer tillers, whereas the overexpression of **OsTRXh1** leads to a salt-sensitive phenotype in rice.
   - In addition, both the knockdown and overexpression of **OsTRXh1** decrease abscisic acid sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth.
   - **OsTRXh1** is ubiquitously expressed in rice, and its expression is induced by salt and abscisic acid treatments.
   - Intriguingly, **OsTRXh1** is secreted into the extracellular space, and salt stress in the apoplast of rice induces its expression at the protein level.
   - We also analyzed the levels of hydrogen peroxide produced in transgenic plants, and the results show that more hydrogen peroxide is produced in the extracellular space of **OsTRXh1** knockdown plants than in wild-type plants, whereas the **OsTRXh1** overexpression plants produce less hydrogen peroxide under salt stress.
   - Characterization of rice pho2 complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic OsPHO2 or OsPHO2(C445S) (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that OsPHO2(C445S) restored Pi concentration in rice to statistically significant lower levels compared to native OsPHO2 Moreover, the suppression of **OsTRXh1** (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves.
