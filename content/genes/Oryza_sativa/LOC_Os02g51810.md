## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g51810](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g51810)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0754500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0754500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OM64
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OM64** mutant also showed enhanced resistance to SSB, a chewing insect, which was due to promotion of Jasmonic acid biosynthesis and related responses.
   - This study confirmed **OM64** as a negative regulator  of rice herbivore resistance through regulating H2 O2 production.
   - **OM64** is a potentially efficient candidate to improve BPH and SSB resistance through gene deletion.
   - Why the **OM64** mutant was resistant to both piercing-sucking and chewing  insects via a gene deficiency in mitochondria is discussed.
   - **OM64** protein is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane by subcellular localization and its deficiency constitutively activated H2 O2 signaling, which stimulated antibiosis and tolerance to BPH.
   - Deficiency of mitochondrial outer membrane protein 64 confers rice resistance to both piercing-sucking and chewing insects in rice.
   - The **OM64** mutant also showed enhanced resistance to SSB, a chewing insect, which was due to promotion of Jasmonic acid biosynthesis and related responses.
