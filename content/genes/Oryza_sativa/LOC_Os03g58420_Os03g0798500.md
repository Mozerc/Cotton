## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g58420](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g58420)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0798500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0798500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsWRKY6
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Heterologous expression of **OsWRKY6** enhanced disease resistance to pathogen.
   - All together, **OsWRKY6** functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of the plant defense response.
   - Defense-related genes were constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines overexpressing **OsWRKY6**.
   - Heterologous expression of **OsWRKY6** gene in Arabidopsis activates the expression of defense related genes and enhances resistance to pathogens.
   - **OsWRKY6**-ox lines displayed leaf lesions, and increased **OsWRKY6** levels caused cell death.
   - Several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were constitutively activated, including OsPR10a, and transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) plants overexpressing (ox) **OsWRKY6** exhibited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens.
   - By contrast, PR gene induction was compromised in transgenic **OsWRKY6**-RNAi lines, suggesting that **OsWRKY6** is a positive regulator of defense responses.
   - Our results suggest that **OsWRKY6** positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and **OsWRKY6** stabilization.
   - This indicates that **OsWRKY6** can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations.
   - OsWRKY transcription factors are involved in various biotic stress responses in rice, and **OsWRKY6** specifically acts as an important defense regulator against Xoo.
   - However, the relationship between **OsWRKY6** and other OsWRKYs, as well as its role in resistance (R) gene-mediated defense, have yet to be studied in depth.
   - The **OsWRKY6** transcriptional cascade functions in basal defense and Xa1-mediated defense of rice against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae..
   - The rice protein **OsWRKY6** directly activates OsWRKY45 and OsWRKY47 expression, and also activates OsPR1a and OsPR1b through the two OsWRKYs, and this transcriptional module participates in Xa1-mediated defense against the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - Here, we characterized a transcriptional cascade triggered by **OsWRKY6** that regulated defense against Xoo infection mediated by the NBS-LRR protein Xa1.
   - Two **OsWRKY6** RNAi knockdown lines showed significantly reduced defense even against an incompatible Xoo infection, and the expression of **OsWRKY6** was not regulated by OsWRKY51 and OsWRKY88.
   - This study reveals that a novel downstream transcriptional pathway activated by **OsWRKY6** is involved in Xa1-mediated defense against Xoo.
