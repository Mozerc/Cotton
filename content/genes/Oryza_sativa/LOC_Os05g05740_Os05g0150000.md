- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Natural variation of **HTH5** from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage..
   - Moreover, we found that two SNPs located in the **HTH5** promoter region are involved with its expression level and associated with heat tolerance diversity.
   - These findings suggest that the novel gene **HTH5** might have great potential value for heightening rice tolerance to heat stress to the on-going threat of global warming.
   - Overexpression ofâ€‰**HTH5** increased the seed-setting rate of rice plants under heat stress at the heading stage, whereas suppression of **HTH5** resulted in greater susceptibility to heat stress.
   - Further investigation indicated that **HTH5** reduces reactive oxygen species accumulation at high temperatures by increasing the heat-induced pyridoxal 5&#x27;-phosphate (PLP) content.
   - Natural variation of **HTH5** from wild rice, Oryza rufipogon Griff., is involved in conferring high-temperature tolerance at the heading stage.
