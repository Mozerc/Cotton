## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsARG** protein was localized in the mitochondria, consistent with other arginases.
   - **OsARG** encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice.
   - The phenotype was partially corrected supplying exogenous nitrogen, and fully corrected by a wild type **OsARG** transgene.
   - Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by **OsARG**, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen.
   - **OsARG**, ubiquitously expressed in various organs, was more strongly expressed in the developing panicles.
   - The nitric oxide content and the morphology of ARG-26 and ARG-38 seedlings were both affected by expression of the **OsARG** gene.
   - Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene **OsARG** in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings.
   - The unique rice arginase gene **OsARG** is known to affect nitrogen use efficiency and is also associated with higher yields in rice.
