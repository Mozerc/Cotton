## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using a degenerative probe designed according to the most conservative region of a known Lys- and His-specific amino acid transporter (LHT1) from Arabidopsis, we isolated a full-length cDNA named **OsHT** (histidine transporter of Oryza sativa L.
   - Multiple sequence alignments showed that **OsHT** shares a high degree of sequence conservation at the deduced amino acid level with the Arabidopsis LHT1 and six putative lysine and histidine transporters.
   - Functional complementation experiments demonstrated that **OsHT** was able to work as a histidine transporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting that **OsHT** is a gene that encodes for a histidine transporter from rice.
   - **OsHT**, a rice gene encoding for a plasma-membrane localized histidine transporter.
   - QRT-PCR analysis indicated that **OsLHT1** was expressed in various rice organs, including root, stem, flag leaf, flag leaf sheath and young panicle.
   - Two **OsLHT1** mutants were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology, and the loss-of-function of **OsLHT1** inhibited rice root and shoot growth, thereby markedly reducing grain yields.
   - The aims of this study are to analyze the substrate selectivity of **OsLHT1** and influence of its disruption on rice growth and fecundity.
   - Our results indicated that **OsLHT1** is an amino acid transporter with wide substrate specificity and with preference for neutral and acidic amino acids, and disruption of **OsLHT1** function markedly inhibited rice growth and fecundity.
   - **OsLHT1** (Lysine/Histidine transporter) has been previously reported as a histidine transporter in yeast, but its substrate profile and function in planta are unclear.
   - Transient expression in rice protoplast suggested **OsLHT1** was localized to the plasma membrane, which is consistent with its function as an amino acid transporter.
   - **OsLHT1** is localized throughout the rice root, including root hairs, epidermis, cortex and stele, and to the leaf vasculature.
   - Knockout of **OsLHT1** in japonica resulted in reduced root uptake of amino acids.
   - 15 N-ammonium uptake and subsequently the delivery of root synthesized amino acids to **OsLHT1** shoots were also significantly decreased, which was accompanied by reduced shoot growth.
   - These results together provide evidence that **OsLHT1** functions in both root uptake and root to shoot allocation of a broad spectrum of amino acids in rice.
   - When expressed in yeast, **OsLHT1** supported cell growth on a broad spectrum of amino acids and effectively transported aspartate, asparagine and glutamate.
   - Rice **OsLHT1** Functions in Leaf-to-Panicle Nitrogen Allocation for Grain Yield and Quality.
   - The concentrations of both total N and free amino acids in the flag leaf were similar at anthesis between **OsLHT1** lines and WT while significantly higher in the mutants than WT at maturation.
   - **OsLHT1** is expressed in vascular bundles of leaves, rachis, and flowering organs.
   - **OsLHT1** plants showed lower panicle length and seed setting rate, especially lower grain number per panicle and total grain weight.
   - In this study, we planted knockout mutant lines of **OsLHT1** together wild-type (WT) in paddy field for evaluating **OsLHT1** function in N redistribution and grain production.
   - Taken together, we conclude that **OsLHT1** plays critical role in the translocation of amino acids from vegetative to reproductive organs for grain yield and quality of nutrition and functionality.
   - The **OsLHT1** seeds contained higher proteins and most of the essential free amino acids, similar total starch but less amylose with lower paste viscosity than WT seeds.
   - Knockout of amino acid transporter gene **OsLHT1** accelerates leaf senescence and enhances resistance to rice blast fungus..
   - In comparison to wild type, **OsLHT1** mutant lines showed sustained rusty red spots on fully mature leaf blades irrespective of N supply levels.
   - Notably, no relationship between the severity of leaf rusty red spots and concentration of total N or amino acids was found in **OsLHT1** mutants at different developmental stages.
   - **OsLHT1** inactivation dramatically prevented the leaf invasion of M.
   - In this study, we found that rice amino acid transporter gene **OsLHT1** was expressed in leaves and up-regulated by maturing, N starvation and inoculation of blast fungus and N supply-dependent premature senescence of leaves at vegetative growth stage.
   - Disruption of **OsLHT1** altered transport and metabolism of amino acids and and salicylic acid-related defense genes and production of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid, accumulation of reactive oxygen species.
