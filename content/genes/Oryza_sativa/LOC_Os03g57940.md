## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice homeobox transcription factor HOX1a positively regulates gibberellin responses by directly suppressing **EL1**.
   - In addition, QTLs near Hd2, **Hd16**, and Ghd7, which are involved in inhibition of heading under long-day conditions, function in the same pathway that controls heading date.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the rice flowering-time quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading date 16 (**Hd16**) encodes a casein kinase-I protein.
   - By using near-isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering-time genes, we observed significant digenetic interactions between **Hd16** and four other flowering-time genes (Ghd7, Hd1, DTH8 and Hd2).
   - These results demonstrate that **Hd16** acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of the phosphorylation of Ghd7.
   - **Hd16**, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response.
   - In addition, HOX1a suppresses the transcription of early flowering1 (**EL1**), a negative regulator of GA signaling, and further electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that HOX1a directly bound to the promoter region of **EL1** to suppress its expression and stimulate GA signaling.
   - Rice early flowering1, a **CKI**, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling.
   - To study the relevant regulatory mechanisms, we isolated a rice mutant earlier flowering1, **EL1**, which is deficient in a casein kinase I that has critical roles in both plants and animals.
   - Overexpression of SLR1 in wild-type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by **EL1** deficiency, indicating the negative effect of SLR1 on GA signalling requires the **EL1** function.
   - These results demonstrate that HOX1a functions as a positive regulator of GA signaling by suppressing **EL1**, providing informative hints on the study of GA signaling.
   - **EL1** had an enhanced GA response, consistent with the suppression of **EL1** expression by exogenous GA(3).
   - This study shows **EL1** a novel and key regulator of the GA response and provided important clues on casein kinase I activities in GA signalling and plant development.
   - To confirm the negative effect of the **EL1** mutation on spikelet fertility, we examined a line carrying a T-DNA insertion **EL1** mutant [hereafter ZH11(**EL1**)] and its parental cultivar 'Zhonghua11 (ZH11)'.
   - The **EL1** mutation contributes to early flowering in japonica rice under long days but fails to limit GA signaling, thus negatively affecting spikelet fertility, which results in a loss of grain yield.
   - Thus, **EL1** is essential for photoperiod sensitivity in flowering as well as spikelet fertility in grain production.
   - However, the elite japonica cultivar Koshihikari, which has a nonfunctional **EL1** allele for early flowering in long days, produces fertile spikelets and normal grain yields, like other elite japonica cultivars.
   - This indicates that as-yet-unknown regulator(s) that can overcome the male sterile phenotype of the **EL1** mutation must have been introduced into Koshihikari.
   - Here, we identified two casein kinase genes, **Hd16** and Hd6, which modulate the expression of florigen genes within certain restricted ranges of photoperiod, thereby fine-tuning the critical day length.
   - Tightly controlled expression of OsbHLH35 is critical for anther development in rice.
   - Our data suggest that OsbHLH35 plays an essential role in anther development in rice and the fine control of its expression is crucial to ensure proper seed production.
   - Rice transgenic plants expressing GUS reporter gene under the control of OsbHLH35 promoter (pOsbHLH35::GUS) showed that this TF specifically accumulates in anthers at the meiosis stage and in other spikelet tissues.
   - Plants overexpressing OsbHLH35 presented small and curved anthers, leading to a reduction of 72 % on seed production.
   - Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of OsbHLH35.
