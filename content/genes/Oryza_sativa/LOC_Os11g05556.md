- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os11g0153700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os11g0153700)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OscpSRP54b</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knockout lines of **OscpSRP54b** (LOC_Os11g05556) exhibited similar pale green phenotype to pgl14 with reduced chlorophyll contents and impaired chloroplast development, but showed apparently arrested-growth and died within 3 weeks.
   - Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both OscpSRP54a and **OscpSRP54b** were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice.
   - OscpSRP54a and **OscpSRP54b** might play distinct roles in transporting different chloroplast proteins into thylakoids through cpSRP-mediated pathway.
   - Both OscpSRP54a and **OscpSRP54b** were constitutively expressed mainly in shoots and leaves at the vegetative growth stage.
