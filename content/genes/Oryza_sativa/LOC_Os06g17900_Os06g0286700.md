## Functional Descriptions:
   - The broad-spectrum rice blast resistance gene **Pi9** was cloned using a map-based cloning strategy.
   - The cloned **Pi9** gene provides a starting point to elucidate the molecular basis of the broad-spectrum disease resistance and the evolutionary mechanisms of blast resistance gene clusters in rice.
   - The broad-spectrum blast resistance gene **Pi9** encodes a nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat protein and is a member of a multigene family in rice.
   - Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed that **Pi9** was constitutively expressed in the **Pi9**-resistant plants and was not induced by blast infection.
   - Disease evaluation of the transgenic lines carrying the individual candidate genes confirmed that Nbs2-**Pi9** is the **Pi9** gene.
   - Molecular breeding of thermo-sensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines of rice for blast resistance using **Pi2** gene..
   - In this study, we report the introgression of a rice blast resistance gene **Pi2** from VE6219 into C815S, an elite rice TGMS line, leading to the development of blast resistant TGMS lines through marker assisted selection (MAS) and phenotypic selection approaches.
   - Four new TGMS lines with blast resistance gene **Pi2** were developed from C815S (an elite TGMS line susceptible to the blast, used as recurrent parent) and VE6219 (a blast resistant line harboring **Pi2**, used as donor parent).
   - The broad-spectrum and durable rice blast resistant gene **Pi2** was introgressed into the elite TGMS line C815S background.
   - Allele-specific marker-based assessment revealed that the rice blast resistance genes Pi2 and **Pi9** have not been widely deployed in Chinese indica rice cultivars..
   - The Pi2 and **Pi9** genes confer broad-spectrum resistance against diverse blast isolates.
   - Development of allele-specific markers for Pi2 and **Pi9** would facilitate breeding of blast resistant rice by using the two blast resistance genes.
   - Of the 434 accessions tested, while one indica restorer line Huazhan was identified harboring the Pi2 resistance allele, no other rice line was identified harboring the Pi2 or **Pi9** resistance alleles.
   - The two newly developed markers should be highly useful for using Pi2 and **Pi9** in marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding programs.
   - In this work, we developed two new markers, named **Pi9**-Pro and Pi2-LRR respectively, targeting the unique polymorphisms of the resistant and susceptible alleles of Pi2 and of **Pi9**.
   - Allelic variants of the broad-spectrum blast resistance gene, **Pi9** (nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat region) have been analyzed in Indian rice landraces.
   - Six of them were further selected on the basis of their resistance and susceptible pattern for virulence analysis and selective pattern study of **Pi9** gene.
   - All the blast resistance **Pi9** alleles were grouped into one cluster, whereas **Pi9** alleles of susceptible landraces formed another cluster even though these landraces have a low level of DNA polymorphisms.
