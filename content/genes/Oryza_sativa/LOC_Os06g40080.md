- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Alleviation of seed germination inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, as well as the induction of antioxidant defense were further observed when **Se5** or HY1 was overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, indicating that **Se5** may be useful for molecular breeding designed to improve plant tolerance to oxidative stress.
   - Here, we show that the s73 mutant, identified in a gamma-irradiated Bahia collection, displays early flowering and photoperiodic insensitivity due to a null mutation in the PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 (**Se5**) gene, which encodes an enzyme implicated in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis.
   - Normal grown **YGL2** seedlings showed yellow-green leaves with reduced contents of Chl and tetrapyrrole intermediates whereas an increase of Chl a/b ratio.
   - Compared with wild-type, **Se5** RNAi transgenic plants aggravated seedling growth inhibition, chlorophyll loss and ROS overproduction, and decreased the transcripts of some representative antioxidative genes.
   - Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that **Se5** represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants.
   - The herbicide methyl viologen (MV), which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), was applied to determine whether **Se5** regulates oxidative stress response.
   - In addition, we found expression levels of some genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were concurrently altered in **YGL2** mutant.
   - Rice RNAi mutants silenced for **Se5** were generated and displayed early flowering under long-day conditions, consistent with phenotypes of the null mutation in **Se5** gene reported previously (**Se5** and s73).
   - RNAi knockdown of rice **Se5** gene is sensitive to the herbicide methyl viologen by the down-regulation of antioxidant defense.
   - **YGL2** was constitutively expressed in a variety of rice tissues with the highest levels in leaves and regulated by temperature.
   - Here, we identified that the rice PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY 5 (**Se5**) gene, which encoded a putative HO with high similarity to HO-1 from Arabidopsis (HY1), exhibited HO activity, and localized in the chloroplasts.
   - In this study, we isolated a rice mutant named yellow-green leaf 2 (**YGL2**) from a (60)Co-irradiated population.
   - Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated grana were poorly stacked in **YGL2** mutant, resulting in underdevelopment of chloroplasts.
   - The photoperiodic sensitivity 5 (**Se5**) mutant of rice, a short-day plant, has a very early flowering phenotype and is completely deficient in photoperiodic response.
   - Comparison of **Se5** with hy1, a counterpart mutant of Arabidopsis, suggests distinct roles of phytochromes in the photoperiodic control of flowering in these two species.
   - Here, we identified a rice mutant, yellow leaf and early flowering (**YE1**), and characterized the gene **YE1** by using a map-based cloning method.
   - Furthermore, the expression levels of Chl biosynthetic genes were downregulated in **YE1** seedlings during de-etiolation responses to light.
   - Map-Based Cloning and Functional Analysis of **YE1** in Rice, Which Is Involved in Light-Dependent Chlorophyll Biogenesis and Photoperiodic Flowering Pathway.
   - Expression pattern analysis indicated that **PE-1** was mainly expressed in roots, stems, leaves, leaf sheaths, and young panicles.
   - Furthermore, the chloroplasts of **PE-1** were filled with many large-sized starch grains, and the number of osmiophilic granules (a chloroplast lipid reservoir) was significantly decreased.
   - The **PE-1** plant is accompanied by a decreased chlorophyll content, an enhanced photosynthesis, and a decreased pollen fertility.
