- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0121600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0121600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** RSR1,qHD5
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Seeds of the knockout mutant **RSR1** consistently show the increased amylose content and altered fine structure of amylopectin and consequently form the round and loosely packed starch granules, resulting in decreased gelatinization temperature.
   - In contrast, **RSR1** overexpression suppresses the expression of starch synthesis genes, resulting in altered amylopectin structure and increased gelatinization temperature.
   - Interestingly, a decreased proportion of A chains in **RSR1** results in abnormal starch granules but reduced gelatinization temperature, whereas an increased proportion of A chains in **RSR1**-overexpressing plants leads to higher gelatinization temperatures, which is novel and different from previous reports, further indicating the complicated regulation of starch synthesis and determination of the physicochemical properties of starch.
   - These results demonstrate the potential of coexpression analysis for studying rice starch biosynthesis and the regulation of a complex metabolic pathway and provide informative clues, including the characterization of **RSR1**, to facilitate the improvement of rice quality and nutrition.
   - In addition, **RSR1** mutants have a larger seed size and increased seed mass and yield.
   - Among these genes, Rice Starch Regulator1 (**RSR1**), an APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein family transcription factor, was found to negatively regulate the expression of type I starch synthesis genes, and **RSR1** deficiency results in the enhanced expression of starch synthesis genes in seeds.
   - We fine-mapped **qHD5** and identified LOC_Os05g03040, a gene that encodes an AP2 transcription factor, as the candidate gene of **qHD5** in our previous study.
   - **qHD5** may have been selected during indica rice domestication.
   - Transient expression showed that the **qHD5** protein localizes to the nucleus.
   - All of these results show that **qHD5** represses the heading date in rice.
   - qRT-PCR analysis revealed that **qHD5** represses flowering by down-regulating Ehd2.
