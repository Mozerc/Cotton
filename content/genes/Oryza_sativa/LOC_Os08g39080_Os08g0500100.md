## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertional pex5 mutant, Atpex5, which does not germinate in the absence of sucrose and was resistant to indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), was perfectly rescued by over-expression of **OsPEX5**pL, but not by **OsPEX5**pS.
   - Using the rice PEX14 cDNA as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay, two splice variants of the type I peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS1) receptor, **OsPEX5**pL and **OsPEX5**pS, were cloned from a pathogen-treated rice leaf cDNA library.
   - Expression of **OsPEX5**L and **OsPEX5**S predominantly occurred in leaf tissues, and was induced by various stresses, such as exposure to the pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, and treatment with fungal elicitor, methyl viologen, NaCl or hydrogen peroxide.
   - **OsPEX5** regulates rice spikelet development through modulating jasmonic acid biosynthesis..
   - Similar to **OsPEX5** mutant, knockout mutant of OsOPR7 generated via the CRISPR-Cas9 technology has reduced levels of endogenous JA and also displays an abnormal spikelet phenotype.
   - Application of exogenous JA can partially rescue the abnormal spikelet phenotype of **OsPEX5** and Osopr7.
   - • Our results suggest that **OsPEX5** plays a critical role in regulating spikelet development through mediating peroxisomal import of OsOPR7, thus providing new insights into regulation of JA biosynthesis in plants and expanding our understanding of the biological role of JA in regulating rice reproduction.
   - • We show that **OsPEX5** can physically interact with OsOPR7, an enzyme involved in jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and is required for its import into peroxisome.
