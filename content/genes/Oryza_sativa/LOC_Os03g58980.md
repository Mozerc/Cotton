- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OsGLP3-7** increased plant resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast, and bacterial blight, whereas disease resistance in **OsGLP3-7** RNAi silenced plants was remarkably compromised, suggesting this gene is a positive regulator of disease resistance in rice.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **OsGLP3-7** positively regulates rice disease resistance by activating JA and phytoalexin metabolic pathways, thus providing novel insights into the disease resistance mechanisms conferred by GLPs in rice.
   - Many genes involved in JA and phytoalexin biosynthesis were strongly induced, accompanied with elevated levels of JA and phytoalexins in **OsGLP3-7**-overexpressing plants, while expression of these genes was significantly suppressed and the levels of JA and phytoalexins were reduced in **OsGLP3-7** RNAi plants compared with control plants, both before and after pathogen inoculation.
   - Expression of **OsGLP3-7** was significantly induced by pathogen infection, jasmonic acid (JA) treatment, and hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) treatment.
   - **OsGLP3-7** was highly expressed in leaves and sublocalized in the cytoplasm.
   - **OsGLP3-7** positively regulates rice immune response by activating hydrogen peroxide, jasmonic acid, and phytoalexin metabolic pathways.
