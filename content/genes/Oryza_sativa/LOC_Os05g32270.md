## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SMOS1** expression was induced by exogenous auxin treatment, and the auxin response element (AuxRE) of the **SMOS1** promoter acts as a cis-motif through interaction with auxin response factor (ARF).
   - We propose that **SMOS1** acts as an auxin-dependent regulator for cell expansion during organ size control, and that its function is conserved among land plants.
   - In this study, we identified a new rice loss-of-function mutant, small organ size1 (**SMOS1**), that decreases the final size of various organs due to decreased cell size and abnormal microtubule orientation.
   - Furthermore, a functional fluorophore-tagged **SMOS1** was localized to the nucleus, supporting the role of **SMOS1** as a transcriptional regulator for organ size control.
   - **SMOS1** encodes an unusual APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factor with an imperfect AP2 domain, and its product belongs to the basal AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) lineage, including WRINKLED1 (WRI1) and ADAP.
   - Quantitative analysis of cortical cell length and number indicates that **SHB** has shorter, rather than fewer, cells in the root meristem until around the fifth day after sowing, from which the number of cortical cells is also reduced.
   - **SHB** encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor that directly activates transcription of the GA biosynthesis gene KS1.
   - These defects can be either corrected by exogenous application of bioactive GA or induced in wild-type roots by a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of paclobutrazol on GA biosynthesis, suggesting that GA deficiency is the primary cause of **SHB** mutant phenotypes.
   - Thus, root meristem size in rice is modulated by **SHB**-mediated GA biosynthesis that regulates the elongation and proliferation of meristem cells in a developmental stage-specific manner.

   - RLA1 was identical to the previously reported SMALL ORGAN SIZE 1 (**SMOS1**) which was cloned from another allele.
   - Increased **NGR5** activity consequently uncouples tillering from nitrogen regulation, boosting rice yield at low nitrogen fertilization levels.
   - **NGR5** thus enables enhanced nitrogen use efficiency for improved future agricultural sustainability and food security.
   - We found that genome-wide promotion of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) enables nitrogen-induced stimulation of rice tillering: APETALA2-domain transcription factor **NGR5** (NITROGEN-MEDIATED TILLER GROWTH RESPONSE 5) facilitates nitrogen-dependent recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 2 to repress branching-inhibitory genes via H3K27me3 modification.
   - **NGR5** is a target of gibberellin receptor GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1)-promoted proteasomal destruction.
