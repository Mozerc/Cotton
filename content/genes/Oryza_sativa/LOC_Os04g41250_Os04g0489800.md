- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Interestingly, the basal expression levels of QSH1 and SHAT1 genes (transcription factors that regulate seed-pod shattering in rice) were significantly lower in these plants than in wild-type plants; however, nitrosative stress negatively regulated the expression of QSH1 and SHAT1 in both WT and **RHS1** plants, but positively regulated QSH4 expression in **RHS1** plants alone.
   - The absence of **RHS1**, which encodes a putative armadillo/beta-catenin repeat family protein, resulted in high sensitivity of the **RHS1** plants to nitrosative stress.
   - The expression of CPL1 (a negative regulator of seed shattering in rice) was significantly lower in **RHS1** plants, and we found that CPL1 expression was correlated with S-nitrosothiol (SNO) alteration in **RHS1**.
   - Interestingly noe1, a rice mutant with high SNO levels, exhibited low seed shattering, whereas **RHS1** resulted in low SNO levels with high seed shattering.
   - A Novel **RHS1** Locus in Rice Attributes Seed-Pod Shattering by the Regulation of Endogenous S-Nitrosothiols..
   - The knockout mutant line **RHS1** exhibited a significantly high shattering of grains in comparison to the wild-type plants.
   - Therefore, **RHS1** is a novel gene that negatively regulates the shattering trait in rice via regulation of endogenous SNO levels.
