## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transient expression of green fluorescence protein-fused proteins in onion cells indicated that **OsNDPK2** and OsNDPK3 are localized to plastid and mitochondria respectively, while OsNDPK1 is localized to the cytosol.
   - Three different programs for predicting subcellular targeting indicated that OsNDPK1 and NP922751 were non-organellar, **OsNDPK2** plastidic, and OsNDPK3 mitochondrial.
   - The **WSL12** protein localized to the chloroplast.
   - These results indicate that the **OsNDPK2** encoded by WSL12 plays an important role in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis by regulating the expression levels of related genes.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the WSL12 locus encoded **OsNDPK2**, one of the three nucleoside diphosphate kinases (OsNDPKs).
   - The **WSL12** mutant showed higher superoxide anion level and enhanced sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity.
   - In addition, **WSL12** also affects the response to abiotic stress, such as ABA and salinity in rice, and is beneficial to molecular breeding of stress tolerance.
   - The transcription pattern of many genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, ABA synthesis, light signaling pathway, reactive oxygen species-scavenging pathway and the other two OsNDPKs was altered in the **WSL12** mutant.
   - We isolated a rice mutant named **YSS2** (young seedling stripe2) with a striated seedling phenotype beginning from leaf 2 of delayed plant growth.
   - Real-time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that **YSS2** transcripts accumulated highly in L4 sections at the early leaf development stage.
   - Chlorotic **YSS2** seedlings have decreased pigment contents and impaired chloroplast development.
   - Expression levels of genes associated with Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis in **YSS2** were mostly decreased, but genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis were up-regulated compared to the wild type.
   - Our overall data suggest that **YSS2** has important roles in chloroplast biogenesis.
   - The **YSS2** allele encodes a NDPK2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2) protein showing high similarity to other types of NDPKs.
