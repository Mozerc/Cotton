## Functional Descriptions:
   - Influence of isopropylmalate synthase **OsIPMS1** on seed vigor associated with amino acid and energy metabolism in rice.
   - In this study, rice **OsIPMS1** and OsIPMS2 was cloned, and the roles of **OsIPMS1** in seed vigor were mainly investigated.
   - Disruption of **OsIPMS1** resulted in low seed vigor under various conditions, which might be tightly associated with the reduction of amino acids in germinating seeds.
   - Eleven amino acids that associated with stress tolerance, GA biosynthesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were significantly reduced in **OsIPMS1** mutants compared with those in wide type (WT) during seed germination.
   - Further analysis confirmed that the regulation of **OsIPMS1** in seed vigor involved in starch hydrolysis, glycolytic activity and energy levels in germinating seeds.
   - The effects of seed priming were tightly associated with the mRNA levels of **OsIPMS1** in priming seeds.
   - The **OsIPMS1** might be used as a biomarker to determine the best stop time-point of seed priming in rice.
   - This study provides novel insights into the function of **OsIPMS1** on seed vigor and should have practical applications in seed priming of rice.
