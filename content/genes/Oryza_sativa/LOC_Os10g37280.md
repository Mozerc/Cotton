## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g37280](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g37280)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0516800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0516800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsLCBK1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **OsLCBK1** and OsLCBK2 was induced in rice seedlings after treatments with defense signaling molecules and after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease.
   - Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing **OsLCBK1** were generated and disease resistance assays indicate that the **OsLCBK1**-overexpressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against Pseudmonas syringae pv.
   - Treatment with fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an effective inducer of PCD in plants, resulted in reduced level of cell death in the **OsLCBK1**-overexpressing plants, as indicated by cell death staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes.
   - Expression levels of some defense-related genes were constitutively up-regulated and further induced after pathogen infection in the **OsLCBK1**-overexpressing plants.
