## Functional Descriptions:
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **OsGRDP1** is a critical feedback regulator, thus contributing to the elucidation of the mechanism underlying cell death and disease resistance.
   - **OsGRDP1** was expressed constitutively in all of the organs of the wild-type plants, but it was upregulated throughout plant development in the spl-D mutant.
   - Both the overexpression (OE) and knockdown (RNAi) of **OsGRDP1** resulted in the lesion mimic phenotype.
   - Moreover, the intact protein level of **OsGRDP1** was reduced in the spotted leaves from both OE and RNAi plants, suggesting that the disruption of intact **OsGRDP1** is responsible for lesion formation.
   - **LSL1** controls cell death and grain production by stabilizing chloroplast in rice.
   - RNA sequencing, gene expression, and protein activity analyses indicate that **LSL1** is required for chloroplast function.
   - Furthermore, **LSL1** interacts with PsaD and PAP10 to form a regulatory module that functions in chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development to maintain redox balance.
   - Our results reveal that **LSL1** maintains chloroplast structure, redox homeostasis, and DNA stability, and plays important roles in the interaction between genetic factors and environmental signals and in regulating grain size and quality.
   - The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and comet assays revealed that the **LSL1** mutant contained severe DNA damage, resulting in reduced grain yield and quality.
   - In addition, the **LSL1** mutant exhibited reactive oxygen species accumulation and cell death.
   - The lesion phenotype of the **LSL1** mutant was sharply induced by shading, and its detached leaves incubated in 6-benzylamino purine similarly formed lesions in the dark.
