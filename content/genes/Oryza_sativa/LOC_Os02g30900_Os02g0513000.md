## Functional Descriptions:
   - Moreover, we show here that **OsPBL1** transcripts are abundantly expressed in the leaves of Dongjin seedlings—an RSV-resistant—under normal growth conditions.
   - The rice serine/threonine protein kinase **OsPBL1** (ORYZA SATIVA ARABIDOPSIS PBS1 -LIKE 1) is potentially involved in resistance to rice stripe disease.
   - In this study, we identified the serine/threonine protein kinase **OsPBL1** ( O RYZA S ATIVA ARABIDOPSIS PB S1-L IKE 1), a potential resistance gene to rice stripe disease, by reverse genetic screening with T-DNA insertional mutant lines.
   - We propose that **OsPBL1** is involved in antiviral defense signaling pathways in rice.
   - Exogenous treatment with defense-related phytohormones such as cytokinin and salicylic acid increased the expression of **OsPBL1**.
   - The **OsPBL1** protein was found to localize to the nucleus and to be cleaved upon attack with either healthy or infected SBPHs.
   - Specifically, **OsPBL1** exhibits 67 % amino acid sequence identity to AtPBS1 (AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE1), a positive regulator of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in Arabidopsis.
   - Taken together, our data indicate that **OsPBL1** undergoes various transcriptional and post-translational modifications upon SBPH and/or RSV attack, similar to Arabidopsis PBS1.
