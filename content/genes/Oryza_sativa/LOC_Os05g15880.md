## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os05g15880](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g15880)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0247800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0247800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsXIP
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Analysis using an **OsXIP**-specific antibody revealed that **OsXIP** is markedly accumulated in apoplast in rice root cells by wounding.
   - The transcripts of **OsXIP** and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root.
   - These results reinforced the possibility that **OsXIP** is involved in plant defense mechanisms against phytopathogens.
   - Although the **OsXIP** gene was specifically expressed in mature grains under basal conditions, recombinant **OsXIP** had no effect on rice endogenous xylanases, and **OsXIP**-suppressed transgenic rice plants did not exhibit any change in grain development and germination, suggesting that rice development may be independent of **OsXIP**.
   - RNAi-mediated knockdown of the XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor gene, **OsXIP**, has no effect on grain development and germination in rice.
