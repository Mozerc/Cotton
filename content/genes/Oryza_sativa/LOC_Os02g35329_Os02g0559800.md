## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results strongly suggest that **EL5** and OsUBC5b have roles in plant defense response through the turnover of protein(s) via the ubiquitin/proteasome system.
   - Plants expressing **EL5**C153A and **EL5**W165A, which encode an inactive E3, showed a rootless phenotype accompanied by cell death in root primordia, and those expressing **EL5**V162A, with moderately impaired E3 activity, formed short crown roots with necrotic lateral roots.
   - We hypothesize that **EL5** might be responsible for mediating the degradation of cytotoxic proteins produced in root cells after the actions of phytohormones.
   - The dominant-negative phenotype was specifically observed in root meristems where **EL5** is expressed, and not recovered by exogenous auxin.
   - Deletion of the transmembrane domain prevented the **EL5** from localizing in the membrane and from exerting an inhibitory effect on root formation.
   - We concluded that **EL5** plays a major role as a membrane-anchored E3 for the maintenance of cell viability after the initiation of root primordial formation.
   - RING-H2 type ubiquitin ligase **EL5** is involved in root development through the maintenance of cell viability in rice.
   - Recent analyses revealed that **EL5** plays a crucial role as an E3 in the maintenance of cell viability during root development in rice.
   - **EL5** is involved in root development as an anti-cell death ubiquitin ligase.
   - The structural specificity of the elicitor required for the expression of **EL5** was consistent with other defense reactions observed in the experimental system, indicating that the elicitor signal to **EL5** is transmitted through a single class of receptor-mediated recognition events.
   - We also discuss the possible role of **EL5** as an anti-cell death enzyme.
   - Rice ubiquitin ligase **EL5** prevents root meristematic cell death under high nitrogen conditions and interacts with a cytosolic GAPDH..
   - Root formation in rice transformants overexpressing mutated **EL5** (m**EL5**) was severely inhibited because of meristematic cell death.
   - These results indicate that impairment of **EL5** function activates nitrogen signaling despite the absence of a nitrogen source.
