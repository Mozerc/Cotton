- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0537800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0537800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsAP77</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results suggest that the expression of **OsAP77** is induced by pathogen infection and defense related signaling molecules in a vascular tissue specific manner and that this gene has a positive role of defense response against fungal, bacterial and viral infections.
   - RT-PCR analysis showed that **OsAP77** was induced not only by infection with these pathogens, but also after treatment with SA, INA, H2O2 or ABA.
