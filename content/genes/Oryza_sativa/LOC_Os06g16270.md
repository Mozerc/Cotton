## Functional Descriptions:
   - This report describes the role of OsHSBP1 and **OsHSBP2** in the regulation of the HSR and seed development of rice.
   - The thermotolerance assay revealed that OsHSBP1 and **OsHSBP2** are negative regulators of HSR and involved in acquired thermotolerance but not in basal thermotolerance since their over-expression transgenic lines pre-heated at sublethal temperature, showed significantly decreased seedling survival after heat shock treatment.
   - Furthermore, antioxidant activity and gene expression of catalase and peroxidase was significantly increased in knock-down transgenic seedlings of OsHSBP1 and **OsHSBP2** after heat stress compared with the wild type.
   - Overall, the present study reveals the role of OsHSBP1 and **OsHSBP2** in the regulation of the HSR and seed development of rice.
