- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0672900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0672900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsXYN1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The findings that **OsXYN1** is involved in plant cell wall deposition and regulates plant growth and development help shed light on the functions of the rice GH10 family.
   - Membrane-associated xylanase-like protein **OsXYN1** is required for normal cell wall deposition and plant development in rice.
   - Map-based cloning of the ss1 mutant identified the candidate gene as **OsXYN1** (LOC_03g47010), which encodes a xylanase-like protein belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 10 (GH10) family.
