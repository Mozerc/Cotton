## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Receptor-Like Kinase **SIT1** Mediates Salt Sensitivity by Activating MAPK3/6 and Regulating Ethylene Homeostasis in Rice.
   - Here, we demonstrate that rice (Oryza sativa) Salt Intolerance 1 (**SIT1**), a lectin receptor-like kinase expressed mainly in root epidermal cells, mediates salt sensitivity.
   - **SIT1** mediates ethylene production and salt-induced ethylene signaling. **SIT1** promotes accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to growth inhibition and plant death under salt stress, which occurred in an MPK3/6- and ethylene signaling-dependent manner in Arabidopsis thaliana.
   - Consequently, by blocking **SIT1** phosphorylation, B'κ inhibits and fine tunes **SIT1** activity to balance plant growth and stress adaptation.
   - Mutual regulation of receptor-like kinase **SIT1** and B'κ-PP2A shapes the early response of rice to salt stress.
   - The receptor-like kinase **SIT1** acts as a sensor in rice roots, relaying salt stress signals via elevated kinase activity to enhance salt sensitivity.
   - Here, we demonstrate that Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulatory subunit B'κ constrains **SIT1** activity under salt stress.
   - During early salt stress, activated **SIT1** phosphorylates B'κ; this not only enhances its binding with **SIT1**, it also promotes B'κ protein accumulation via Ser502 phosphorylation.
   - B'κ-PP2A deactivates **SIT1** directly by dephosphorylating the kinase at Thr515/516, a salt-induced phosphorylation site in the activation loop that is essential for **SIT1** activity.
