## Functional Descriptions:
   - However, simultaneous knockdown of **OsSar1a**/b/c resulted in floury and shrunken seeds, with an increased level of glutelin precursor and decreased level of the mature alpha- and beta-subunit.
   - To reveal the route by which glutelin and alpha-globulin exit the ER, four putative Sar1 genes (**OsSar1a**/b/c/d) were cloned from rice, and transgenic rice were generated with Sar1 overexpressed or suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi) specifically in the endosperm under the control of the rice glutelin promoter.
   - **OsSar1a**bc RNAi endosperm generated numerous, spherical, novel protein bodies with highly electron-dense matrixes containing both glutelin and alpha-globulin.
   - These results indicated that **OsSar1a**/b/c play a crucial role in storage proteins exiting from the ER, with functional redundancy in rice endosperm, and glutelin and alpha-globulin transported together from the ER to the Golgi apparatus by a pathway mediated by coat protein complex II.
