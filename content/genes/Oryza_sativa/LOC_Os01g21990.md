## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g21990](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g21990)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0323300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0323300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsCAF2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsCAF2** contains two CRM domains and is necessary for chloroplast development in rice.
   - Phenotypic analysis showed that mutations to **OsCAF2** led to albino leaves at the seeding stage that eventually caused plant death, and **OsCAF2** mutant plants had fewer chloroplasts and damaged chloroplast structure.
   - Conclusion: Taken together, this study improved our understanding of the **OsCAF2** protein, and revealed additional information about the molecular mechanism of **OsCAF2** in regulating of chloroplast development in rice.
   - However, the research of the **OsCAF2** gene in rice is very little, and the effects of **OsCAF2** genes on chloroplasts development are not well characterized.
