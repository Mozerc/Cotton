## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsSAPK2** Confers Abscisic Acid Sensitivity and Tolerance to Drought Stress in Rice.
   - Under salt stress, sapk1, **SAPK2** and, in particular, sapk1/2 mutants, exhibited reduced germination rates, more severe growth inhibition, more distinct chlorosis, reduced chlorophyll contents, and reduced survival rates in comparison with the wild-type plants.
   - These results suggest that SAPK1 and **SAPK2** may function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance at the germination and seedling stages.
   - SAPK1 and **SAPK2** may function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance at the germination and seedling stages in rice.
   - The sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinases SAPK1 and **SAPK2** function collaboratively as positive regulators of salt stress tolerance in rice.
   - We also found that SAPK1 and **SAPK2** affected the osmotic potential following salt stress by promoting the generation of osmotically active metabolites such as proline.
   - SAPK1 and **SAPK2** also improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification following salt stress by promoting the generation of ROS scavengers such as ascorbic acid, and by increasing the expression levels of proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT).
   - SAPK1 and **SAPK2** may be useful to improve salt tolerance in crop plants.
   - Expression profiling revealed that SAPK1 and **SAPK2** expression were strongly induced by drought, NaCl, and PEG treatment, but not by ABA.
   - **SAPK2** contributes to rice yield by modulating nitrogen metabolic processes under reproductive stage drought stress.
   - CONCLUSION: These results suggest that **SAPK2** could enhance grain production by regulating nitrogen utilization efficiency under RDS.
   - The examination of rice seedling growth and development under nutrient-deprived conditions (-N, -K, and<U+2009>-<U+2009>P) proved that **SAPK2** can significantly affect rice seedling growth and root development in hydroponic cultures lacking N and K.
   - japonica, WT) plants, the **SAPK2** rice mutant lines were shorter and produced fewer grains per panicle, smaller grains and lower grain yield under reproductive stage drought stress (RDS).
   - Subsequent analysis suggested that **SAPK2** considerably influences the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents of rice grains.
   - Moreover, the NO3- influx rate and nitrate concentration analysis indicated that **SAPK2** promotes nitrate uptake and assimilation by regulating nitrate-related transporters.
   - The **OsSAPK2** knockout mutants showed the impaired PCD responses in the absence of HT.
