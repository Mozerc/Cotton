## Functional Descriptions:
   - Hypoxic stress also induced **Ospdr9** in rice roots, salt stress induced **Ospdr9** at low levels but cold and heat shock had no effect.
   - Polyethylene glycol and the heavy metals Cd (20 microM) and Zn (30 microM) rapidly and markedly induced **Ospdr9** in roots of rice seedlings.
   - The plant growth regulator jasmonic acid, the auxin alpha-naphthalene acetic acid and the cytokinin 6-benzylaminopurine triggered **Ospdr9** expression.
   - The results suggested that redox changes may be involved in the abiotic stress response regulation of **Ospdr9** in rice roots.
   - **Ospdr9**, which encodes a PDR-type ABC transporter, is induced by heavy metals, hypoxic stress and redox perturbations in rice roots.
   - The antioxidants dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid rapidly and markedly induced **Ospdr9** in rice roots; the strong oxidant hydrogen peroxide also induced **Ospdr9** but at three times lower levels.
   - Furthermore, a spatial expression analysis showed that Cd-induced expression of **OsABCG36** was found in both the root tip and mature root region.
   - Immunostaining showed that **OsABCG36** was localized in all root cells except the epidermal cells.
   - Knockout of **OsABCG36** resulted in increased Cd accumulation in root cell sap, and enhanced Cd sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals including Al, Zn, Cu, and Pb.
   - Taken together, our results indicated that **OsABCG36** is not involved in Cd accumulation in the shoots, but is required for Cd tolerance by exporting Cd or Cd conjugates from the root cells in rice.
   - The ABC transporter **OsABCG36** is required for Cd tolerance in rice.
   - Transient expression of **OsABCG36** in rice protoplast cells showed that it was localized to the plasma membrane.
