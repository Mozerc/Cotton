## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os05g12680](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g12680)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0218400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0218400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** Z15
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of **Z15** is induced by moderate low temperature (18<U+2009><a1><e3>C).
   - The mutation of **Z15** influenced the expression of two downstream genes, OsWRKY71 and OsMYB4, that were responsive to moderate low temperature.
   - The results show that **Z15** plays a crucial role in the early stages of the response to moderate low temperature in rice.
   - Further study indiceted that **Z15** plays a crucial role in the early stages of the response to moderate low temperature in rice.
   - Subcellular localization analysis indicates that **Z15** and **Z15** are localized on the plasma membrane.
