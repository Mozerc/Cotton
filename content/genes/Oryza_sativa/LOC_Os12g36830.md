## Functional Descriptions:
   - Previously, we identified **RSOsPR10** as a root-specific pathogenesis-related (PR) protein induced by drought and salt treatments in rice.
   - In the JA-deficient mutant hebiba, **RSOsPR10** expression was up-regulated by NaCl, wounding, drought and exogenous application of JA.
   - Expression of **RSOsPR10**, involved in the JA signalling pathway, was induced in transgenic rice.
   - Expression of OsERF1, a transcription factor in the JA/ET pathway, was induced earlier than that of **RSOsPR10** after salt, JA and ACC treatments.
   - Transcripts and proteins of **RSOsPR10** were strongly induced by jasmonate (JA) and the ethylene (ET) precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), while salicylic acid (SA) almost completely suppressed these inductions.
   - **RSOsPR10** expression in response to environmental stresses is regulated antagonistically by jasmonate/ethylene and salicylic acid signaling pathways in rice roots.
   - The present results indicate that **RSOsPR10** is a novel rice PR10 protein, which is rapidly induced in roots by salt, drought stresses and blast fungus infection possibly through activation of the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, but not the abscisic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathway.
   - Immunohistochemical analyses showed that **RSOsPR10** strongly accumulated in cortex cells surrounding the vascular system of roots, and this accumulation was also suppressed when SA was applied simultaneously with stress or hormone treatments.
   - Simultaneous SA treatment strongly inhibited the induction of **RSOsPR10** expression and, to a lesser extent, induction of OsERF1 expression.
   - These results suggest that JA/ET and SA pathways function in the stress-responsive induction of **RSOsPR10**, and that OsERF1 may be one of the transcriptional factors in the JA/ET pathway.
   - A novel rice PR10 protein, **RSOsPR10**, specifically induced in roots by biotic and abiotic stresses, possibly via the jasmonic acid signaling pathway.
   - Interestingly, induction was observed almost exclusively in roots, thus we named the gene **RSOsPR10** (root specific rice PR10).
