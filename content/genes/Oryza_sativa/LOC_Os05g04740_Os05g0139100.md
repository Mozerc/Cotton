## Functional Descriptions:
   - Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1) and ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (**APG**), is involved in controlling rice grain length.
   - PGL2 interacts with a typical bHLH protein **APG**, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo.
   - These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of **APG** by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of **APG**.
   - An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein **APG**.
   - PGL1-**APG** represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which **APG** is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1.
   - Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and **APG**-silenced plants.
   - Phytochrome B Negatively Affects Cold Tolerance by Regulating OsDREB1 Gene Expression through Phytochrome Interacting Factor-Like Protein **OsPIL16** in Rice..
   - Based on these results, we propose that phyB deficiency positively regulates OsDREB1 expression through **OsPIL16** to enhance cell membrane integrity and to reduce the malondialdehyde concentration, resulting in the improved cold tolerance of the phyB mutants.
   - Expression pattern analyses revealed that **OsPIL16** transcripts were induced by cold stress and was significantly higher in the phyB mutant than in the WT.
