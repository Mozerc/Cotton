## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g57520](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g57520)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0820800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0820800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PTC2</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PTC2** showed persistent tapetal cells and abnormal pollen wall patterning including absent nexine, collapsed bacula and disordered tectum.
   - The defective tapetal PCD phenotype of **PTC2** was similar to that of a PCD delayed mutant, ptc1, in rice, while the abnormal pollen wall patterning resembled that of a pollen wall defective mutant, tek, in Arabidopsis thaliana.
   - Based on these data, we propose a model explaining how **PTC2** affects anther and pollen development.
   - The characterization of **PTC2** in tapetal PCD and pollen wall patterning expands our understanding of the regulatory network of male reproductive development in rice and will aid future breeding approaches.
   - Levels of anther cutin monomers in **PTC2** anthers were significantly reduced, as was expression of a series of lipid biosynthetic genes.
   - **PTC2** transcript and protein were shown to be present in the anther after meiosis, consistent with the observed phenotype.
