## Functional Descriptions:
   - Analysis of mRNA and the endogenous GAs reveal that biologically active GA level is increased by up-regulation of the **OsGA20ox1** gene in B142.
   - Within this mapped region, we identified the gene **OsGA20ox1**, which is related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis.
   - Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including **OsGA20ox1**, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level.
   - These results indicate that **OsGA20ox1** is a strong candidate gene for major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice.
   - **OsGA20ox1**, a candidate gene for a major QTL controlling seedling vigor in rice.
   - A role of **OsGA20ox1** , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice.
   - The QTL **GNP1** Encodes GA20ox1, Which Increases Grain Number and Yield by Increasing Cytokinin Activity in Rice Panicle Meristems..
   - We propose that cytokinin activity increased due to a KNOX-mediated transcriptional feedback loop resulting from the higher **GNP1** transcript levels, in turn leading to increased expression of the GA catabolism genes GA2oxs and reduced GA1 and GA3 accumulation.
   - Sequence variations in its promoter region increased the levels of **GNP1** transcripts, which were enriched in the apical regions of inflorescence meristems in NIL-**GNP1**TQ.
   - The **SDSFL1** mutant demonstrated some distinguished structural alterations, including shorter plant height and flag leaf length, increased tiller numbers and flag leaf width, and decreased panicle length compared with those of wild type (WT).
   - The results thus offer a visible foundation for the molecular and physiological analysis of the **SDSFL1** gene, which might participate in various functional pathways for controlling plant height and leaf length in rice breeding.
   - Photosynthesis analysis showed that the photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were significantly increased in **SDSFL1**.
   - Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of **GNP1** and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice..
   - Although the NAL1 and **GNP1** genes regulating the rice GNP and grain yield have been cloned, their allelic diversity, functional differences in rice germplasms, and effects of their combination on GNP and grain yield remain unclear.
   - Our results indicated that the **GNP1** and NAL1 exhibited obvious differentiation and their combinations can significantly increase the grain yield in geng rice cultivars.
   - These observations provide insights into the molecular basis of the GNP and may be useful for rice breeding of high yield potential by pyramiding **GNP1** and NAL1.
   - Pleiotropic Effect of **GNP1** Underlying Grain Number per Panicle on Sink, Source and Flow in Rice.
   - Our previous study indicated that the gene **GNP1** encoding gibberellin biosynthesis gene GA20ox1 affects grain number per panicle (GNP) in rice, thus resulting in increase of grain yield.
   - To clarify **GNP1** effect on sink, source and flow in regulating rice grain yield, we compared Lemont, a japonica (geng) cultivar, with its near-isogenic line (NIL-**GNP1** TQ) in Lemont background with introgression of the allele at **GNP1** from Teqing, a high-yielding indica (xian) cultivar.
   - Our results indicated that significantly increased GNP from introgression of **GNP1** TQ into Lemont did not highly significantly improve grain yield of NIL-**GNP1** TQ as expected, due primarily to significant low sink activities in IS and possible insufficient source supply which didn't fully meet the increased sink capacity.
   - Meanwhile, the expression of GA synthesis-related gene **OsGA20ox1** was downregulated, whereas the expression of GA inactivation-related genes was upregulated in ipa1-NIL seeds.
   - Further, the results demonstrated genomic and genetic evidence that the SV in the promoter of LTG1 is accounting for chilling sensitivity, and the increased copy numbers of **GNP1** were associated with positive effects on grain number.
