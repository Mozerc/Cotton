## Functional Descriptions:
   - We here show that a QTL that increases grain productivity in rice, Gn1a, is a gene for cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (**OsCKX2**), an enzyme that degrades the phytohormone cytokinin.
   - Quantitative real-time PCR results show that **OsCKX2**, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues.
   - The expression level of **OsCKX2** in the shoot apex of Dn1-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that **OsCKX2** does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets.
   - Here, we report that the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) directly regulates **OsCKX2** expression in the reproductive meristem.
   - We identify that DST(reg1), a semidominant allele of the DST gene, perturbs DST-directed regulation of **OsCKX2** expression and elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain number.
   - Reduced expression of **OsCKX2** causes cytokinin accumulation in inflorescence meristems and increases the number of reproductive organs, resulting in enhanced grain yield.
   - ) Gn1a/**OsCKX2** (Grain number 1a/Cytokinin oxidase 2) gene, which encodes a cytokinin oxidase, has been identified as a major quantitative trait locus contributing to grain number improvement in rice breeding practice.
   - Importantly, the DST(reg1) allele provides an approach to pyramid the **Gn1a**-dependent and **Gn1a**-independent effects on grain production.
   - Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/**OsCKX2** expression.
   - DST-directed expression of **OsCKX2** regulates CK accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the reproductive organs.
   - Southern blot analysis confirmed the integration of the shRNA genes into the rice genome, and quantitative real time RT-PCR and northern blot analyses showed reduced **OsCKX2** expression in the young stem of transgenic rice at varying degrees.
   - Consistently, insertional activation of **OsCKX2** led to increased expression of CKX2 and reduced tiller number and growth in a gene-dosage dependant manner.
   - Taken together, these results demonstrate that specific suppression of **OsCKX2** expression through shRNA-mediated gene silencing leads to enhanced growth and productivity in rice by increasing tiller number and grain weight.
   - Gn1a (**OsCKX2**), which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, plays an important role in regulating rice grain yield.
   - It might be valuable to explore the high-yield-related alleles of **Gn1a** to develop high-yield rice cultivars in future breeding programs.
   - Importantly, we found a negative-correlation between **OsCKX2** expression and plant productivity as evident by assessment of agronomical parameters such as panicle branching, filled grains per plant, and harvest index both under control and salinity stress conditions.
   - We utilized an RNAi-based approach to study the function of **OsCKX2** in maintaining grain yield under salinity stress condition.
   - To determine if there exists, a correlation between **OsCKX2** levels and yield under salinity stress condition, we assessed the growth, physiology and grain yield of **OsCKX2**-knockdown plants vis-Ã -vis the wild-type.
   - TKnockdown of an inflorescence meristem-specific cytokinin oxidase - **OsCKX2** in rice reduces yield penalty under salinity stress condition.
   - Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the BC3F2 population showed that the introgressed segment carrying the **Gn1a** allele of GKBR significantly increased the branch number and grain number per panicle.
   - To achieve the high yield potential of Kongyu 131, a minute chromosome fragment carrying the favorable **Gn1a** allele from the donor parent was introgressed into the genome of Kongyu 131, which resulted in a larger panicle and subsequent yield increase in the new Kongyu 131.
   - Dissecting the genetic basis of heavy panicle hybrid rice uncovered **Gn1a** and GS3 as key genes.
   - Shuhui498 (R498) is an elite parent of heavy panicle hybrid rice by pyramiding the rare **Gn1a** and null gs3 alleles.
   - The null **Gn1a** allele is the determinant factor for heavy panicles through increased grain number, while gs3 is associated with grain size and weight.
   - In this study, **OsCKX2** was specifically overexpressed in roots using RCc3 promoter to investigate the effects of root-source cytokinins on the growth of rice.
   - **OsCKX2** overexpressed (OE) rice showed retarded growth with lower cytokinin levels and biomass production.
   - To conclude, reduced cytokinin levels via root-specific overexpression of **OsCKX2** resulted in developmental defects, which confirmed the importance of root-source cytokinins in plant growth and morphogenesis.
   - **OsCKX2** irreversibly degrades nucleobase cytokinins by encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase to control grain production in rice.
   - Shoot-specific transcriptome analysis between **OsCKX2** OE rice and wild type (WT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cell division, cell wall structure, phytohormone signaling, and assimilation and catabolism.
   - Further analysis indicated more robust tolerance of **OsCKX2** KO plants to Pi deficiency, which exhibited higher phosphorus concentration, larger shoot biomass, and lesser leaf yellowing under Pi deficiency; whereas the opposite was observed for **OsCKX2** OE plants.
   - These results indicated that **OsCKX2** impacted Pi uptake, recycling, and plant growth via Pi transporters, phospholipid hydrolysis, and glycolysis under Pi deficiency.
   - **OsCKX2** regulates phosphate deficiency tolerance by modulating cytokinin in rice.
   - Overall, **OsCKX2** negatively regulated Pi deficiency tolerance by modulating CTKs in rice.
   - The present study analyzed the phenotypic and physiological characteristics of **OsCKX2** overexpressing (OE) and knockout (KO) rice plants after exposure to phosphate (Pi) deficiency and the transcriptome and metabolome to investigate the function of **OsCKX2** in response to Pi deficiency.
   - **OsCKX2** KO plants demonstrated higher endogenous CTK levels than wild-type (WT) under Pi deficiency.
   - Transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed that overexpression of **OsCKX2** downregulated the transcriptional levels of genes related to Pi transporters, membrane lipid metabolism, and glycolysis, and reduced the consumption of metabolites in membrane lipid metabolism and glycolysis.
   - On the contrary, knockout of **OsCKX2** upregulated the expression of Pi transporters, and increased the consumption of metabolites in membrane lipid metabolism and glycolysis.
