## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results suggest that **OsBIABP1** may be a defense-related AMP-binding protein that is involved in the regulation of defense response through SA and/or JA/ET signaling pathways.
   - **OsBIABP1** is expressed in stems, leaves and flowers of rice plants, but is not expressed, or expressed at a very low level, in rice roots.
   - Furthermore, the expression of **OsBIABP1** is activated by the infection of Magnaporthe oryzae, and the induced expression is quicker and stronger during early stages of pathogenesis in incompatible interaction than that in compatible interaction between rice and M.
   - A second screen using an infrared thermography camera revealed that one of the mutants, named **SLAC1**, had a constitutive low leaf temperature phenotype.
   - Measurement of leaf gas exchange showed that **SLAC1** plants grown in the greenhouse had significantly higher stomatal conductance (g (s)), rates of photosynthesis (A), and ratios of internal [CO(2)] to ambient [CO(2)] (C (i)/C (a)) compared with wild-type plants, whereas there was no significant difference in the response of photosynthesis to internal [CO(2)] (A/C (i) curves).
   - Increased leaf photosynthesis caused by elevated stomatal conductance in a rice mutant deficient in **SLAC1**, a guard cell anion channel protein.
   - The expression of **OsBIABP1** was induced by some defense-related signal molecules, e.
   - Molecular characterization of a defense-related AMP-binding protein gene, **OsBIABP1**, from rice.
   - **SLAC1** is a stomatal anion channel protein controlling stomatal closure in response to environmental [CO(2)].
   - In order to examine stomatal limitations to photosynthesis, a **SLAC1**-deficient mutant of rice was isolated and characterized.
   - All three lines had maximum gs during the tillering stage, when the gs values were 50% higher in **SLAC1** and 70% lower in **SLAC1**-F461A, compared with WT.
   - Both **SLAC1** and **SLAC1**-F461A retained the ability to change gs in response to the day-night cycle, and showed differences in tillering rate and plant height compared with WT, and lower grain yield.
   - These observations show that **SLAC1** plays a crucial role in regulating stomata in rice at the tillering stage.
   - To discern the contribution of stomatal regulation to rice growth, we compared gs among wild-type (WT) and two mutants, **SLAC1** and the dominant-positive mutant **SLAC1**-F461A, which expresses a point mutation causing an amino acid substitution (F461A) in **SLAC1**, at different growth stages.
   - Contribution of the S-type anion channel **SLAC1** to stomatal control and its dependence on developmental stage in rice.
   - **SLAC1** is an S-type anion channel protein that controls stomatal closure in response to elevated CO2.
   - Rice **SLAC1** mutants showed significantly increased stomatal conductance (gs) and enhanced CO2 assimilation.
   - In addition, SAPK10 phosphorylated **OsSLAC1** in vitro and transgenic rice overexpressing SAPK10 or **OsSLAC1** showed significantly less water loss than control.
