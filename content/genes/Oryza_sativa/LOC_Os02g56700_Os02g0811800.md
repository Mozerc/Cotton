## Functional Descriptions:
   - Notably, transgenic rice plants with root-preferential overexpression of **OsCCR10** exhibited higher grain yield than NT controls plants under field drought conditions, indicating that lignin biosynthesis mediated by **OsCCR10** contributes to drought tolerance.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsCCR10** showed improved drought tolerance at the vegetative stages of growth, as well as higher photosynthetic efficiency, lower water loss rates, and higher lignin content in roots compared to non-transgenic (NT) controls.
   - In contrast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated **OsCCR10** knock-out mutants exhibited reduced lignin accumulation in roots and less drought tolerance.
   - The **OsCCR10** transcript levels were found to increase in response to abiotic stresses, such as drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid (ABA), and transcripts were detected in roots at all developmental stages.
   - Subcellular localisation assays revealed that **OsCCR10** is a catalytically active enzyme that is localised in the cytoplasm.
