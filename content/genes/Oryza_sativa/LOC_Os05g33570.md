## Functional Descriptions:
   - Immunoblot analysis of separated seed tissue fractions (pericarp, embryo + aleurone, seed embryo) revealed that regulatory phosphorylation of **ppdk** occurs in the non-green seed embryo and green outer pericarp layer, but not in the endosperm + aleurone layer.
   - Our results suggest that cytosolic **ppdk** functions in rice to modulate carbon metabolism during grain filling.
   - We have isolated a floury endosperm-4 (**FLO4**) rice mutant with a floury-white endosperm but a normal outer portion.
   - We obtained two additional alleles, **FLO4**-2 and **FLO4**-3, that also showed the same white-core endosperm phenotype.
   - Expression analyses demonstrated that the cytosolic mRNA of **OsPPDKB** was induced in the reproductive organs after pollination, and greatly increased until about 10 days after fertilization.
   - The single C3 organ type where **ppdk** is in high abundance, and, therefore, where its function is most amenable to elucidation, are the developing seeds of graminaceous cereals.
   - In this report, we suggest a non-photosynthetic function for C3 **ppdk** by characterizing its abundance and posttranslational regulation in developing Oryza sativa (rice) seeds.
   - Using primarily an immunoblot-based approach, we show that **ppdk** is a massively expressed protein during the early syncitial-endosperm/-cellularization stage of seed development.
   - As seed development progresses from this early stage, the enzyme undergoes a rapid, posttranslational down-regulation in activity and amount via regulatory threonyl-phosphorylation (**ppdk** inactivation) and protein degradation.
   - The modestly abundant pool of inactive **ppdk** (phosphorylated + dephosphorylated) that was found to persist in mature rice seeds was shown to remain largely unchanged (inactive) upon seed germination, suggesting that **ppdk** in rice seeds function in developmental rather than in post-developmental processes.
   - White-core endosperm floury endosperm-4 in rice is generated by knockout mutations in the C-type pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase gene (**OsPPDKB**).
