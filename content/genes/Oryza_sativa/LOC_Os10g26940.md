- **Gene Symbol:** OsBURP16
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - All these results suggested that overexpression of **OsBURP16** caused pectin degradation and affected cell wall integrity as well as transpiration rate, which decreased tolerance to abiotic stresses.
   - Overexpression of stress-inducible **OsBURP16**, the beta subunit of polygalacturonase 1, decreases pectin content and cell adhesion and increases abiotic stress sensitivity in rice.
   - Transcription of **OsBURP16** is induced by cold, salinity and drought stresses, as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
   - Analysis of plant survival rates, relative ion leakage rates, accumulation levels of H2 O2 and water loss rates of leaves showed that overexpression of **OsBURP16** enhanced sensitivity to cold, salinity and drought stresses compared with controls.
   - **OsBURP16** overexpression reduced pectin content and cell adhesion and increased abiotic stress sensitivity in rice.
