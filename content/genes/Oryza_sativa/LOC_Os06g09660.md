- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In -Pi conditions, the shoot biomass of **OsARF16** was slightly reduced, and neither root growth nor iron content was induced, indicating that the knockout of **OsARF16** led to loss of response to Pi deficiency in rice.
   - Six phosphate starvation-induced genes (PSIs) were less induced by -Pi in **OsARF16** and these trends were similar to a knockdown mutant of OsPHR2 or AtPHR1, which was a key regulator under -Pi.
   - **OsARF16**, a transcription factor, is required for auxin and phosphate starvation response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - Here, we show that **OsARF16**, an auxin response factor, functions in both auxin and -Pi responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - The knockout of **OsARF16** led to primary roots (PR), lateral roots (LR) and root hair losing sensitivity to auxin and -Pi response.
   - These data first reveal the biological function of **OsARF16**, provide novel evidence of a linkage between auxin and -Pi responses and facilitate the development of new strategies for the efficient utilization of Pi in rice.
   - **OsARF16** Is Involved in Cytokinin-Mediated Inhibition of Phosphate Transport and Phosphate Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - In this study, we found that **OsARF16** is required for the cytokinin response and is involved in the negative regulation of Pi uptake and Pi signaling by cytokinin.
   - Most Fe-deficient symptoms could be partially restored in the **OsARF16** mutant, including dwarfism, photosynthesis decline, a reduction in iron content and root system architecture (RSA) regulation.
   - Our results reveal a new biological function for **OsARF16** and provide important information on how ARF-medicated auxin signaling affects iron signaling and the iron deficiency response.
   - We found that **OsARF16** was involved in the iron deficiency response and the induction of iron deficiency response genes.
   - Furthermore, the qRT-PCR data indicated that the induction of Fe-deficiency response genes by iron deficiency was more compromised in the **OsARF16** mutant than in Nipponbare.
   - Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of osarf12 or **OsARF16** exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV.
   - Transformation with modified OsARF11, **OsARF16** and OsWOX3A genomic DNA lacking uORFs rescued the narrow leaf phenotype of nal21 to a better extent than transformation with their native genomic DNA, implying that RPS3A could regulate translation of ARFs and WOX3A through uORFs.
