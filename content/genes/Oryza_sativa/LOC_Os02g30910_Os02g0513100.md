## Functional Descriptions:
   - SWEET11 and 15 as key players in seed filling in rice..
   - OsSWEET11 and 15 are essential for seed filling.
   - The accumulation of starch in the pericarp of ossweet11 and ossweet11;15 double mutants supports the critical roles of OsSWEET11 and **OsSWEET15** in sucrose translocation and mobilization towards the developing endosperm..
   - Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and **OsSWEET15** and activates their expression.
   - Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and **OsSWEET15** genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses.
   - Sucrose transport in response to drought and salt stress involves ABA-mediated induction of OsSWEET13 and **OsSWEET15** in rice.
   - Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of <a6><c2>-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and **OsSWEET15** are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses.
   - Notably, the ovaries in the blighted grains of the **OsSWEET15** mutants expanded after flowering but terminated their development before the endosperm cellularization stage and subsequently glucuronidase (GUS) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter lines representing the **OsSWEET15** expression showed that the gene was expressed in the endosperm tissues surrounding the embryo, which supposedly supplies nutrients to sustain embryo development.
   - These results together with the protein&#x27;s demonstrated sucrose transport capacity and plasma membrane localization suggest that **OsSWEET15** plays a prominent role during the caryopsis formation stage, probably by releasing sucrose from the endosperm to support embryo development.
   - We show that the knockout of a sugar transporter gene **OsSWEET15** led to a significant drop in rice fertility with around half of the knockout mutant&#x27;s spikelets bearing blighted or empty grains.
   - By contrast, the empty grains were probably caused by the reduced pollen viability of the **OsSWEET15** mutants.
   - These results indicate that both **OsSWEET15** and OsSWEET11 play important and similar roles in rice pollen development, caryopsis formation and seed-setting, in addition to their function in seed-filling that was demonstrated previously.
