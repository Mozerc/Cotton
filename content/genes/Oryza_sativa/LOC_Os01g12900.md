- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we show that the constitutively active **OsRac1** (i) causes HR-like responses and greatly reduces disease lesions against a virulent race of the rice blast fungus; (ii) causes resistance against a virulent race of bacterial blight; and (iii) causes enhanced production of a phytoalexin and alters expression of defense-related genes.
   - Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that **OsRac1** has a general role in disease resistance of rice.
   - The constitutively active (CA) G19V mutation of **OsRac1** was previously shown to induce reactive oxygen species production, phytoalexin synthesis and defense gene activation, leading to resistance to rice blast infection.
   - Proteins involved in redox regulation, chaperones such as heat shock proteins, BiP, and chaperonin 60, proteases and protease inhibitors, cytoskeletal proteins, subunits of proteasomes, and enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid and ethylene biosynthesis pathways were found to be induced by CA-**OsRac1** or SE.
   - We have previously shown that a human small GTPase Rac homolog, **OsRac1**, from rice (Oryza sativa) induces cascades of defense responses in rice plants and cultured cells.
   - Interestingly, of 100 proteins that were up-regulated by a SE, 87 were also induced by CA-**OsRac1**, suggesting that **OsRac1** plays a pivotal role in defense responses induced by SE in cultured rice cells.
   - Results of our proteomic analysis revealed that **OsRac1** is able to induce many proteins in various signaling and metabolic pathways and plays a predominant role in the defense response in cultured rice cells.
   - We have previously shown that the Rac homolog of rice, **OsRac1**, is a regulator of ROI production and cell death in rice.
   - We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (OsMT2b) was synergically down-regulated by **OsRac1** and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors.
   - In the CA-g**OsRac1** plants, a number of genes previously shown to be induced by Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - Expression of the constitutively active **OsRac1**, a small GTPase Rac of rice, in d1 mutants restored SE-dependent defense signaling and resistance to rice blast.
   - We have proposed a model for the defense signaling of rice in which the heterotrimeric G protein functions upstream of the small GTPase **OsRac1** in the early steps of signaling.
   - To study the precise localization of **OsRac1** in the PM and its possible association with other signaling components, we performed proteomic analysis of DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes) isolated from rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged constitutively active (CA) **OsRac1**.
   - Proteome analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) associated with **OsRac1**-mediated innate immunity in rice.
   - We introduced the constitutively active and the dominant negative forms of the small GTP-binding protein **OsRac1**, a rice homolog of human Rac, into the wild type and a lesion mimic mutant of rice and analyzed H(2)O(2) production and cell death in transformed cell cultures and plants.
   - **OsRac1**, one of the Rac/Rop family of small GTPases, plays important roles in defense responses, including a role in the production of reactive oxygen species mediated by NADPH oxidase.
   - Thus, it is likely that **OsRac1** controls lignin synthesis through regulation of both NADPH oxidase and OsCCR1 activities during defense responses in rice.
   - In the leaf blade of homozygous CA-g**OsRac1** plants, mutant transcript levels were much lower than in those of wild-type plants.
   - We have established a plant version of a F<U+00F6>rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe called Ras and interacting protein chimeric unit (Raichu) that can successfully monitor activation of the rice small GTPase **OsRac1** during various defence responses in cells.
   - Importance of **OsRac1** and RAI1 in signalling of NLR protein-mediated resistance to rice blast disease.
   - We also identified RAI1, a transcriptional activator, as a PID3 interactor required for PID3-mediated blast resistance and showed that RAI1 expression is induced by PID3 via a process mediated by **OsRac1**.
   - This study describes a new signalling pathway for NLR protein-mediated blast resistance and shows that **OsRac1** and RAI1 act together to play a critical role in this process.
   - We identified **OsRac1**, a known GTPase, as a signaling molecule in PID3-mediated blast resistance, implicating **OsRac1** as a possible common factor downstream of rice NLR proteins.
   - The Rho-family GTPase **OsRac1** controls rice grain size and yield by regulating cell division.
   - As a result, **OsRac1** overexpression improves grain yield in O.
   - Interestingly, **OsRac1** interacts with and regulates the phosphorylation level of OsMAPK6, which is known to regulate cell division and grain size in rice.
   - Thus, our findings suggest **OsRac1** modulates rice grain size and yield by influencing cell division.
   - This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of rice grain size and suggests that **OsRac1** could serve as a potential target gene for breeding high-yield crops.
   - RNA-seq and cell cycle analyses suggest that **OsRac1** promotes cell division.
   - We have previously found that the small GTPase **OsRac1** plays key roles in the signaling of OsCERK1, a PRR for fungal chitin, and of Pit, an NLR for rice blast fungus, and associates directly and indirectly with both of these immune receptors.
   - These findings illuminate how the PRR OsCERK1 and the NLR Pit orchestrate rice immunity through the small GTPase **OsRac1**.
