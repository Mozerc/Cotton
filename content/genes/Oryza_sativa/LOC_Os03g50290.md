## Functional Descriptions:
   - The 14-3-3 protein **GF14f** negatively affects grain filling of inferior spikelets of rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - Using **GF14f**-RNAi plants, we observed that a reduction in **GF14f** expression in the endosperm resulted in a significant increase in both grain length and weight, which in turn improved grain yield.
   - These results suggest that **GF14f** negatively affects grain development and filling, and the observed higher abundance of the **GF14f** protein in IS compared to SS may be responsible for poor IS grain filling.
   - The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying poor grain filling of IS and suggests that **GF14f** could serve as a potential tool for improving rice grain filling.
   - Furthermore, pull-down assays indicated that **GF14f** interacts with enzymes that are involved in sucrose breakdown, starch synthesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis.
   - Overexpression of **OsGF14f** Enhances Quantitative Leaf Blast and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.
   - Here, we showed that the transcription of **OsGF14f** was significantly induced by leaf blast infection, and the overexpression of **OsGF14f** quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast and bacterial blight in rice.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that **OsGF14f** positively regulates leaf blast and bacterial blight resistance in rice via the SA-dependent signaling pathway.
   - Although it is known that rice 14-3-3 family genes are involved in various defense responses, the functions of **OsGF14f** in response to diseases have not been reported.
   - In addition, the expression level of **OsGF14f** was significantly induced after SA treatment, and higher endogenous SA levels were observed in the **OsGF14f**-overexpressing plants compared with that in wild-type plants, especially after blast challenge.
   - **GF14f** gene is negatively associated with yield and grain chalkiness under rice ratooning.
   - CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that this genetic regulation by **GF14f** gene was the main cause leading to changes in rice yield and grain chalkiness improvement of ratoon rice, irrespective of seasonal or environmental effects.
   - A further significance was to see how yield performance and grain quality of ratoon rice were able to be achieved at higher levels via suppression of **GF14f**.
   - Furthermore, these variations were shown to be associated with a protein-coding gene: **GF14f** (encoding **GF14f** isoform of 14-3-3 proteins) and such gene negatively impacts oxidative and environmental resistance in ratoon rice.
