## Functional Descriptions:
   - In the **OsGBP** mutant, the extent of GBSSI and GBSSII binding to starch in the leaf and endosperm was significantly lower than wild type.
   - Our data suggest that **OsGBP** plays an important role in leaf and endosperm starch biosynthesis by mediating the binding of GBSS proteins to developing starch granules.
   - The total starch and amylose contents in **OsGBP** mutants were significantly lower than those of wild type in leaves and grains, resulting in reduced grain weight and quality.
   - This elucidation of the function of **OsGBP** enhances our understanding of the molecular basis of starch biosynthesis in rice and contributes information that can be potentially used for the genetic improvement of yield and grain quality.
   - The carbohydrate-binding module 48 (CBM48) domain present in the C-terminus of **OsGBP** is crucial for **OsGBP** binding to starch.
