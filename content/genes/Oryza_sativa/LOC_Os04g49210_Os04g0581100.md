- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0581100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0581100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsSAH3,OsS5H1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knockout OsSAH2 and **OsSAH3** (sahKO) genes conferred enhanced resistance to both hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, whereas overexpression of each OsSAH gene increased susceptibility to the pathogens.
   - Analysis of the **OsSAH3** promoter indicated that its induction was mainly restricted around Magnaporthe oryzae infection sites.
   - Recombinant OsSAH proteins catalyzed SA in vitro, while **OsSAH3** protein showed only SA 5-hydroxylase (SA5H) activity, which was remarkably higher than that of other OsSAHs that presented both SA3H and SA5H activities.
   - SA levels were significantly increased in the oss5h mutants, while they were dramatically decreased in the **OsS5H1** and OsS5H2 overexpression lines.
