## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsNRAMP5** RNAi (**OsNRAMP5**i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap.
   - The suppression of **OsNRAMP5** promoted Cd translocation to shoots, highlighting the importance of this gene for Cd phytoremediation.
   - Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant **OsNRAMP5** greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain.
   - **OsNRAMP5** expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem.
   - **OsNRAMP5** localized to the plasma membrane, and complemented the growth of yeast strains defective in Mn, Fe, and Cd transport.
   - These data reveal that **OsNRAMP5** contributes to Mn, Cd, and Fe transport in rice and is important for plant growth and development.
   - Hydroponic culture showed that Cd concentrations in shoots and roots of **OsNRAMP5** mutants were dramatically decreased, resulting in rescue of impaired growth in high Cd condition.
   - Here, we report the development of new indica rice lines with low Cd accumulation and no transgenes by knocking out the metal transporter gene **OsNRAMP5** using CRISPR/Cas9 system.
   - In particular, the plant yield was not significantly affected in **OsNRAMP5** mutants.
   - **OsNRAMP5** is a key gene involved in the control of the uptake of Cd, Mn, and other metal ions by rice root cells.
   - The determination of metal content and the statistics of related agronomic traits revealed that the functionally deficient **OsNRAMP5** not only significantly reduced the accumulation of Cd in the grains of the mutants but also affected rice yield and quality.
   - Additionally, we also found that the increase in the concentration of Mn in the soil restored the phenotype of the declined yield and quality due to the functional deficiency of **OsNRAMP5**.
   - Mutation at Different Sites of Metal Transporter Gene **OsNRAMP5** Affects Cd Accumulation and Related Agronomic Traits in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - In the present study, three Huanghuazhan-based **OsNRAMP5** mutants [LCH1 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 1), LCH2 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 2), and LCH3 (Low Cadmium Huanghuazhan 3)] were obtained using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology.
   - However, with the decrease of **OsNRAMP5** mutation degree, its effects on chlorenchyma Mn accumulation, yield, and quality were also diminished.
   - The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and OsLsi2 for Si uptake and **OsNRAMP5** for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice.
   - Besides, **OsNRAMP5** expression level in roots seemed more related to root Mn accumulation.
   - At last, multi-level regulating and processing of the process from gene expression to protein translation might account for the inconsistent relationship between root **OsNRAMP5** expression level and Cd accumulation in roots.
   - Manganese (Mn) transporter **OsNRAMP5** was widely reported to regulate cadmium (Cd) uptake in rice.
   - The fact that function of **OsNRAMP5** mainly focuses on Mn uptake, together with the fact that many transporter genes involved in Cd uptake might result in the insignificant correlation between **OsNRAMP5** expression level and Cd accumulation in roots.
   - Overexpression of **OsNRAMP5** decreased Cd translocation from roots to shoots by disrupting radial transport of Cd into the stele for xylem loading, demonstrating the effect of transporter localization and polarity on ion homeostasis.
   - Overexpressed **OsNRAMP5** protein was localized to the plasma membrane of all cell types in the root tips and lateral root primordia without polarity.
   - Overexpression of the manganese/cadmium transporter **OsNRAMP5** reduces cadmium accumulation in rice grain.
   - When grown in three Cd-contaminated paddy soils, **OsNRAMP5** overexpression decreased grain Cd concentration by 49-94% compared with wild type.
   - The effect of **OsNRAMP5** knockout on reducing root Cd uptake weakened, however its effect on improving root-to-shoot Cd translocation was constant with increasing environmental Cd concentrations.
   - Knockout of **OsNRAMP5** enhances rice tolerance to cadmium toxicity in response to varying external cadmium concentrations via distinct mechanisms..
   - It is vital to evaluate the effects of knocking out **OsNRAMP5** on Cd and Mn accumulation, as well as Cd tolerance of rice plants in response to varying environmental Cd concentrations, and to uncover the underlying mechanism, which until now, has remained largely unexplored.
   - **OsNRAMP5** is a transporter responsible for cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of Mn in rice plants.
   - Among several genes involved in rice Cd accumulation, the loss of function of **OsNRAMP5** is known to be effective in reducing grain concentration by inhibiting root uptake.
   - With the aim of improving Mn uptake in **OsNRAMP5** mutants while still restricting the grain Cd concentration below the upper limit of international standards, we identified a novel **OsNRAMP5** allele encoding a protein in which glutamine (Q) at position 337 was replaced by lysine (K).
   - However, disruption of this gene simultaneously decreases manganese (Mn) uptake because **OsNRAMP5** is a major Mn transporter.
   - A weak allele of **OsNRAMP5** confers moderate cadmium uptake while avoiding manganese deficiency in rice..
   - Knockout of **OsNRAMP5** in rice by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing resulted in significant decreases in root uptake of Pb and accumulation in rice shoots.
   - When grown in Pb-contaminated paddy soil, **OsNRAMP5** knockout mutants accumulated approximately 50 and 70% lower Pb concentrations in the grain and straw, respectively, than the wild type.
   - **OsNRAMP5** Is a Major Transporter for Lead Uptake in Rice..
   - These results indicate that **OsNRAMP5** is a major transporter for Pb uptake in rice, in addition to its role in the uptake of manganese and cadmium.
   - Higher expression of **OsNRAMP5** increased uptake of Cd and Mn into the root cells but decreased Cd release to the xylem.
