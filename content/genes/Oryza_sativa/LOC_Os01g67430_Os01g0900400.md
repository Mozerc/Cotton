## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME1 (**EG1**) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy.
   - We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the **EG1** mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in **EG1**.
   - As a putative class III lipase that functionally differs from any known plant lipase, **EG1** reveals a novel pathway that regulates rice empty-glume fate and spikelet development.
   - In addition to affecting the identity and number of empty glumes, mutations in **EG1** caused ectopic floral organs to be formed at each organ whorl or in extra ectopic whorls.
   - **EG1** is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia.
   - We show that **EG1** is a plastid-targeted lipase that participates in JA biosynthesis, and EG2/OsJAZ1 is a JA signalling repressor that interacts with a putative JA receptor, OsCOI1b, to trigger OsJAZ1's degradation during spikelet development.
   - Collectively, our results demonstrate that **EG1** promotes floral robustness against temperature fluctuation by safeguarding the expression of floral identify genes through a high temperature-dependent mitochondrial lipid pathway and uncovers a novel mechanistic insight into floral developmental control.
   - Furthermore, we found that numerous environmentally responsive genes including many floral identity genes are transcriptionally repressed in **EG1** mutants and OsMADS1, OsMADS6 and OsG1 genetically act downstream of **EG1** to maintain floral robustness.
   - **GY1** functions at the initial step of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis to repress mesocotyl and coleoptile elongation in etiolated rice seedlings.
   - Ethylene inhibits the expression of **GY1** and other genes in the JA biosynthesis pathway to reduce JA levels and enhance mesocotyl and coleoptile growth by promoting cell elongation.
   - Genetically, **GY1** acts downstream of the OsEIN2-mediated ethylene signaling pathway to regulate mesocotyl/coleoptile growth.
   - **GY1** was identified through map-based cloning and encodes a PLA1-type phospholipase that localizes in chloroplasts.
