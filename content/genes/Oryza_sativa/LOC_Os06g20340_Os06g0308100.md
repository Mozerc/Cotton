## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results indicated that **OsIBR5** is a MKP which was induced by abiotic stresses and decreased tolerance to drought stress in transgenic tobacco plants.
   - Drought and ABA-induced stomatal closure was significantly reduced in **OsIBR5**-overexpressing tobacco plants compared with controls.
   - Overexpression of **OsIBR5** in tobacco plants resulted in hypersensitivity to drought and H(2)O(2) treatments.
   - Moreover, **OsIBR5** was found to interact with tobacco MAPKs SIPK and WIPK, and drought-induced WIPK activity was impaired in **OsIBR5**-overexpressing tobacco plants.
