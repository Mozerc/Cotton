## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we cloned the UDP-glucosyltransferase gene **EDR1** (Endosperm Development in Rice) responsible for differential endosperm development between upland rice and paddy rice by performing QTL analysis and map-based cloning.
   - Natural variations in **EDR1** significantly reduced the UDP-glucosyltransferase activity of **EDR1**(YZN) compared to **EDR1**(YD1) , resulting in abnormal endosperm development in the near-isogenic line (NIL), accompanied by insufficient grains and changes in grain quality.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that the UDP-glucosyltransferase gene **EDR1** is an important determinant controlling differential endosperm development between upland rice and paddy rice.
   - **EDR1** was highly expressed in developing seeds during grain filling.
