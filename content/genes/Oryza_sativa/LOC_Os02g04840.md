## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g04840](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g04840)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0141300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0141300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** CAP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **CAP1** heterozygous plant produced equal numbers of normal and collapsed abnormal grains.
   - A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing **CAP1** restored mutants to normal pollen grains.
   - Based on the metabolic pathway of l-arabinose, **CAP1** pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of l-arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP-l-arabinose derived from l-arabinose 1-phosphate.
   - Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the **CAP1** mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth.
   - During rice pollen development, **CAP1** was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the **CAP1** mutation were mainly detected at this stage.
   - We isolated a pollen-defective mutant, collapsed abnormal pollen1 (**CAP1**), from Tos17 insertional mutant lines of rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Our results suggested that **CAP1** and related genes are critical for pollen development in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.
