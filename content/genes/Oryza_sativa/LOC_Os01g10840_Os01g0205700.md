- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0205700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0205700)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsGSK1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - T-DNA tagged knockout mutation of rice **OsGSK1**, an orthologue of Arabidopsis BIN2, with enhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses.
   - Therefore, we propose that stress-responsive **OsGSK1** may have physiological roles in stress signal-transduction pathways and floral developmental processes.
   - Overexpression of the full-length **OsGSK1** led to a stunted growth phenotype similar to the one observed with the gain-of-function BIN/AtSK21 mutant.
   - The gene responsible for this GUS-positive phenotype was revealed by inverse PCR as **OsGSK1** (Oryza sativa glycogen synthase kinase3-like gene 1), a member of the plant GSK3/SHAGGY-like protein kinase genes and an orthologue of the Arabidopsis brassinosteroid insensitive 2 (BIN2), AtSK21.
   - This suggests that **OsGSK1** might be a functional rice orthologue that serves as a negative regulator of brassinosteroid (BR)-signaling.
   - Northern blot analysis showed that **OsGSK1** was most highly detected in the developing panicles, suggesting that its expression is developmental stage specific.
   - Knockout (KO) mutants of **OsGSK1** showed enhanced tolerance to cold, heat, salt, and drought stresses when compared with non-transgenic segregants (NT).
