## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g11900](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g11900)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0217900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0217900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** ROS1a,OsROS1a
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed **ROS1a** expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells.
   - Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal **ROS1a** allele, the maternal **ROS1a**-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of **ROS1a** in endosperm development.
   - DNA demethylation by **ROS1a** in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm..
   - Here, we report genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation in wild-type and **ROS1a** mutant sperm and vegetative cells.
   - We find that the rice vegetative cell genome is locally hypomethylated compared with sperm by a process that requires **ROS1a** activity.
   - We show that many **ROS1a** target sequences in the vegetative cell are hypomethylated in the rice central cell, suggesting that **ROS1a** also demethylates the central cell genome.
   - Similarly, the expression of genes involved in pollen and anther development was decreased in **OsROS1a** mutants as compared to WT.
   - The **OsROS1a** mutants had shrink spikelets, smaller anthers and pollen grains, and were not stained by iodine staining showing a significant reduction in total soluble sugar and starch contents as compared to wildtype (WT), which caused complete male sterility.
   - Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in **OsROS1a** Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - Combined with previous studies, our findings suggested that the RRMF domain in **OsROS1a** is the functional domain and loss of RRMF for **OsROS1a** causes sterility in rice.
