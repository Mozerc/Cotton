## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice leucine-rich repeat extensin-like protein **OsPEX1** mediates the intersection of lignin deposition and plant growth.
   - When **OsPEX1** was ectopically expressed in rice cultivars with tall stature that lacks the allele of semi-dwarf 1, well-known green revolution gene, the resulting transgenic plants displayed reduced height and enhanced lodging resistance.
   - Lastly, we demonstrated that modulating **OsPEX1** expression could provide a tool for improving rice lodging resistance.
   - Conversely, **OsPEX1**-suppresssed transgenics displayed low lignin content and reduced transcriptional abundance of genes associated with lignin biosynthesis, indicating that the **OsPEX1** mediates lignin biosynthesis and/or deposition in rice.
   - Our study uncovers a causative effect between the expression of **OsPEX1** and lignin deposition.
   - The **OsPEX1** gene is preferentially expressed in rice anther, suggesting that it may be involved in the regulation of pollen development.
   - Effect of extensin-like **OsPEX1** on pollen fertility in rice.
   - The **OsPEX1** RNAi transgenic lines showed a significant decrease in seed setting rate (10%~30%) due to pollen sterility.
   - However, whether and how **OsPEX1** affects root growth is unclear.
   - Here, we found that overexpression of **OsPEX1** retarded root growth by reducing cell elongation likely caused by an increase of lignin deposition, whereas knockdown of **OsPEX1** had an opposite effect on root growth, indicating that **OsPEX1** negatively regulated root growth in rice.
   - Further investigation uncovered the existence of a feedback loop between **OsPEX1** expression level and GA biosynthesis for proper root growth.
   - This was supported by the facts that exogenous GA(3) application downregulated transcript levels of **OsPEX1** and lignin-related genes and rescued the root developmental defects of the **OsPEX1** overexpression mutant, whereas **OsPEX1** overexpression reduced GA level and the expression of GA biosynthesis genes.
   - Moreover, **OsPEX1** and GA showed antagonistic action on the lignin biosynthesis in root.
   - Taken together, this study reveals a possible molecular pathway of **OsPEX1**mediated regulation of root growth through coordinate modulation of lignin deposition via a negative feedback regulation between **OsPEX1** expression and GA biosynthesis.
   - In contrast to the tissue specificity of Arabidopsis PEX genes in reproductive organs, rice **OsPEX1** is also highly expressed in roots in addition to reproductive tissue.
