## Functional Descriptions:
   - The rice CYP78A gene **BSR2** confers resistance to Rhizoctonia solani and affects seed size and growth in Arabidopsis and rice..
   - Both Arabidopsis and rice plants overexpressing **BSR2** had slower growth and produced longer seeds than wild-type control plants.
   - These results indicate that **BSR2** is associated with disease resistance, growth rate and seed size in rice and suggest that its function is evolutionarily conserved in both monocot rice and dicot Arabidopsis.
   - When overexpressed in rice, **BSR2** also conferred resistance to two R.
