## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results suggested that **OsMYB30** exhibited a regulatory effect on the breakdown of starch through the regulation of the BMY genes.
   - These results together suggested that **OsMYB30** might be a novel regulator of cold tolerance through the negative regulation of the BMY genes by interacting with OsJAZ9 to fine tune the starch breakdown and the content of maltose which might contribute to the cold tolerance as a compatible solute.
   - The **OsMYB30** transcription factor suppresses cold tolerance by interacting with a JAZ protein and suppressing beta-amylase expression..
   - In this study, we characterized a cold-responsive R2R3-type MYB gene **OsMYB30** for its regulatory function in cold tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Functional analysis revealed that overexpression of **OsMYB30** in rice resulted in increased cold sensitivity, while the **OsMYB30** knockout mutant showed increased cold tolerance.
   - These results indicate that **OsMYB5P** is associated with the regulation of shoot development and root- system architecture.
   - **OsMYB5P** protein is localized to the nucleus and functions as a transcription activator in plant development.
   - Overexpression of **OsMYB5P** in rice and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0) increases tolerance to phosphate starvation, whereas **OsMYB5P** knock-out through RNA interference increases sensitivity to Pi depletion in rice.
   - Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of **OsMYB5P** increases tolerance to Pi deficiency in plants by modulating Pi transporters at the transcriptional level in monocots and dicots.
   - Overexpression of **OsMYB5P** led to increased Pi accumulation in shoots and roots.
   - In addition, overexpression of **OsMYB5P** in Arabidopsis triggered increased expression of AtPht1;3, an Arabidopsis Pi transporter, in shoots and roots under normal and Pi-deficient conditions.
   - Rice **OsMYB5P** improves plant phosphate acquisition by regulation of phosphate transporter..
   - Here, we report the involvement of the **OsMYB30** gene in the bsr-d1-mediated blast resistance.
   - We further find that **OsMYB30** binds to and activates the promoters of 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase genes (Os4CL3 and Os4CL5) resulting in accumulation of lignin subunits G and S.
   - It acts as a positive regulator of cold tolerance by repressing some cold-related genes such as OsWRKY45-1, OsSRFP1, OsCYL4 and **OsMYB30**.
   - Under cold stress treatments, the transcription of four cold-related genes OsWRKY45-1, OsSRFP1, OsCYL4, and **OsMYB30** was repressed in OsGATA16-overexpressing (OE) rice compared with wild-type (WT).
