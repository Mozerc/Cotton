## Functional Descriptions:
   - An activation-tagged mutant **OsMADS57**-1 and **OsMADS57**-overexpression lines showed increased tillers, whereas **OsMADS57** antisense lines had fewer tillers.
   - OsMIR444a-overexpressing lines exhibited suppressed **OsMADS57** expression and tillering.
   - Furthermore, **OsMADS57**-1 was insensitive to strigolactone treatment to inhibit axillary bud outgrowth, and **OsMADS57**'s function in tillering was dependent on D14.
   - Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated **OsMADS57**, together with OsTB1, target D14 to control tillering.
   - The interaction between **OsMADS57** and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14.
   - Here we report that **OsMADS57** interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice.
   - Here, we demonstrate that interacting transcription factors **OsMADS57** and OsTB1 directly target the defense gene OsWRKY94 and the organogenesis gene D14 to trade off the functions controlling/moderating rice tolerance to cold.
   - However, D14 transcription was directly promoted by **OsMADS57** for suppressing tillering under the chilling treatment, whereas D14 was repressed for enhancing tillering under normal condition.
   - Overexpression of **OsMADS57** maintains rice tiller growth under chilling stress.
   - **OsMADS57** together with OsTB1 coordinates transcription of its target OsWRKY94 and D14 to switch its organogenesis to defense for cold adaptation in rice..
   - We demonstrated that **OsMADS57** and OsTB1 conversely affect rice chilling tolerance via targeting OsWRKY94.
   - **OsMADS57** binds directly to the promoter of OsWRKY94, activating its transcription for the cold stress response, while suppressing its activity under normal temperatures.
   - **OsMADS57** is abundantly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of root stele and is induced by nitrate.
   - 2 mM nitrate, **OsMADS57** mutants had 31% less xylem loading of nitrate, while overexpression lines had two-fold higher levels.
   - Rapid NO3- root influx experiments showed that mutation of **OsMADS57** did not affect root nitrate uptake.
   - Moreover, seminal root elongation was inhibited in **OsMADS57** mutants, which may be associated with higher auxin levels in and auxin polar transport to root tips of mutant plants.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that **OsMADS57** has a role in regulating nitrate translocation from root to shoot via OsNRT2.
   - 3a functions in nitrate translocation, indicating the possible interaction between **OsMADS57** and OsNRT2.
   - Rice transcription factor **OsMADS57** regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism..
   - These results indicated that **OsMADS57** acts as an important transcriptional regulator that regulates stem elongation and panicle exsertion in rice via GA-mediated regulatory pathway.
   - Here we investigated the functions of **OsMADS57** in plant vegetative growth in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Knockdown of **OsMADS57** reduced the plant height, internode elongation and panicle exsertion in rice plants.
   - Moreover, **OsMADS57** knockdown plants were more sensitive to gibberellic acid (GA3), and contained less bioactive GA3 than wild-type plants, which implied that **OsMADS57** is involved in gibberellin (GA) pathway.
   - The level of EUI1 transcripts involved in GA deactivation was also increased in **OsMADS57** knockdown plants.
   - In addition, **OsMADS57** also modulated the expression of multiple genes involved in GA metabolism or GA signaling pathway, indicating the key and complex regulatory role of **OsMADS57** in GA pathway in rice.
   - However, the role of the transcription factor **OsMADS57** under salinity stress is still unknown.
   - Moreover, less reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in **OsMADS57** overexpressing lines when exposed to salt stress, as measured by 3, 3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) or nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) staining.
   - Further experiments exhibited that overexpression of **OsMADS57** in rice significantly increased the tolerance ability of plants to oxidative damage under salt stress, mainly by increasing the activities of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD), reducing malonaldehyde (MDA) content and improving the expression of stress-related genes.
   - Taken together, these results demonstrated that **OsMADS57** plays a positive role in enhancing salt tolerance by activating the antioxidant system.
