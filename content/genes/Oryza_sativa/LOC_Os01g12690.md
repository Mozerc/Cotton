- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OFP1** led to enlarged leaf angles, reduced plant height, and altered grain shape, largely resembled DLT overexpression plants.
   - In addition, we found **OFP1** was greatly induced by BR treatment, and OsBZR1, the critical transcription factor of BR signaling, was physically associated with the **OFP1** promoter.
   - Moreover, we showed that gibberellin synthesis was greatly repressed in **OFP1** overexpression plants, suggesting **OFP1** participates in the inhibition of plant growth by high BR or elevated BR signaling.
   - Taken together, we identified **OFP1** as an additional regulator of BR responses and revealed how BRs promote **OFP1** at both transcription and protein levels to modulate plant architecture and grain morphology in rice.
   - **OFP1** was ubiquitously expressed and the protein was localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus.
   - Genetic analysis showed that the regulation of plant architecture by **OFP1** depends on DLT function.
   - Furthermore, we revealed that **OFP1** directly interacts with GSK2 kinase, and inhibition of the kinase activity significantly promotes **OFP1** protein accumulation in plant.
