## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptional activation experiments indicated that **OsSPL18** is a functional transcription factor with activation domains in both the N-terminus and C-terminus, and both activation domains are indispensable for its biological functions.
   - In this study, we studied the biological function of **OsSPL18** during grain and panicle development in rice.
   - Knockout (KO) mutants of **OsSPL18** exhibited reduced grain width and thickness, panicle length and grain number, but increased tiller number.
   - qRT-PCR and GUS staining analyses showed that **OsSPL18** was highly expressed in developing young panicles and young spikelet hulls, in agreement with its function in regulating grain and panicle development.
   - Both yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase (LUC) assays showed that **OsSPL18** could bind to the DEP1 promoter, suggesting that **OsSPL18** regulates panicle development by positively regulating the expression of DEP1.
   - Cytological analysis showed that **OsSPL18** regulates the development of spikelet hulls by affecting cell proliferation.
   - **OsSPL18** controls grain weight and grain number in rice.
   - Quantitative expression analysis showed that DEP1, a major grain number regulator, was significantly down-regulated in **OsSPL18** KO lines.
