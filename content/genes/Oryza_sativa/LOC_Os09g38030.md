## Functional Descriptions:
   - The suppression of UGPase by the introduction of a **UGPase1**-RNAi construct in wild-type plants nearly eliminated seed set because of the male defect, with developmental retardation similar to the ms-h mutant phenotype, whereas overexpression of **UGPase1** in ms-h mutant plants restored male fertility and the transformants produced T(1) seeds that segregated into normal and chalky endosperms.
   - Our results suggest that **UGPase1** plays a key role in pollen development as well as seed carbohydrate metabolism.
   - **OsUgp1** has recently been reported to be essential for callose deposition during pollen mother cell and meiosis stages as well as for seed carbohydrate metabolism.
   - OsUgp2 complements **OsUgp1** to fulfill the UGPaseâ€™s functions necessary for the full process of pollen development.
   - Pollen mother cells (PMCs) of **Ugp1**-silenced plants appeared normal before meiosis, but during meiosis, normal callose deposition was disrupted.
   - These results demonstrate that rice **Ugp1** is required for callose deposition during PMC meiosis and bridges the apoplastic unloading pathway and pollen development.
   - We report a functional characterization of rice **Ugp1**, which is expressed throughout the plant, with highest expression in florets, especially in pollen during anther development.
   - Expressing a double-stranded RNA interference construct in **Ugp1**-RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both **Ugp1** and Ugp2, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development.
   - In addition, both phenotypes were co-segregated with the **UGPase1** transgene in segregating T(1) plants, which demonstrates that **UGPase1** has functional roles in both male sterility and the development of a chalky endosperm.
   - Inactivation of the **UGPase1** gene causes genic male sterility and endosperm chalkiness in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - **Ugp1** silencing by RNA interference or cosuppression results in male sterility.
