## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, the molecular role of **OsDOF27** in thermal stress tolerance has been elucidated.
   - The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that **OsDOF27** was significantly upregulated under different abiotic stress treatments in rice, particularly under heat stress.
   - Furthermore, the rice transgenic lines with overexpressing **OsDOF27** revealed a positive role in mitigating heat stress tolerance.
   - Collectively, our results evidently show the intrinsically disorderedness in **OsDOF27** and its role in thermal stress response in rice.
   - The stress-responsive transcript induction of **OsDOF27** was further correlated with enriched abiotic stress-related cis-regulatory elements present in its promoter region.
   - The in vivo functional analysis of the potential role of **OsDOF27** in thermotolerance was further studied in yeast and in planta.
   - Ectopic expression of **OsDOF27** in yeast implicates thermotolerance response.
