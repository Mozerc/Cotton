- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0663800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0663800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** FLOC1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - These findings suggest that **FLOC1** is involved not only in seed fertility but also in seed quality.
   - these findings imply that there is a difference in the functions of FLO2 and **FLOC1** although both of appear to be involved in the control of seed quality during seed formation.
   - A knock-down transformant of **FLOC1** showed significantly reducted fertility and generation of seeds with abnormal features.
