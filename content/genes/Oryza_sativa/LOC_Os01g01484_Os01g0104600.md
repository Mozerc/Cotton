- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g01484](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g01484)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0104600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0104600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsDET1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Genetic complementation demonstrated that **OsDET1** mutation conferred the enhanced Chl content in the Gc mutant leaf.
   - Here, we found that **OsDET1** is essential for maintaining normal rice development.
   - In conclusion, our data suggest that **OsDET1** plays an important role in maintaining normal development in rice, and mediates the crosstalk between ABA biosynthesis and ABA signaling pathways in rice.
   - **OsDET1** Modulates the ABA Signaling Pathway and ABA Biosynthesis in Rice.
   - The repression of **OsDET1** had detrimental effects on plant development, and we found that **OsDET1** is involved in modulating ABA signaling in rice.
   - **OsDET1** RNAi plants exhibited an ABA hypersensitivity phenotype.
   - Using yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays, we determined that **OsDET1** physically interacts with OsDDB1 and OsCOP10; OsDDA1 binds to the ABA receptors OsPYL5 and OsDDB1.
   - These findings suggest that **OsDET1** deficiency disturbs the CDD complex, which is responsible for ABA receptor (OsPYL) degradation, eventually leading to ABA sensitivity in rice.
   - Additionally, **OsDET1** also modulated ABA biosynthesis, as ABA biosynthesis was inhibited in **OsDET1** RNAi plants and promoted in OE-**OsDET1** plants.
   - These findings will enhance our understanding of the functional roles of **OsDET1** and the CDD complex in embryogenesis and flavonoid biosynthesis in rice seeds.
