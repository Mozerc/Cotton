## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsMADS27** regulates the root development in a NO3--Dependent manner and modulates the salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - Here we investigated the roles of **OsMADS27** in the root development in response to NO3- availability.
   - Constitutive expression of **OsMADS27** significantly inhibited the elongation of primary root (PR), but enhanced lateral root (LR) formation in a NO3--dependent manner.
   - ABA is reported to play an important role in mediating the effects of NO3- on the root development, thus it is supposed that **OsMADS27** might regulate the root growth and development by ABA pathway.
   - The root growth and development in **OsMADS27** overexpression lines was shown to be more sensitive to exogenous ABA than wild type.
   - Taken together, our findings suggested that **OsMADS27** is an important regulator controlling the root system development and adaption to osmotic stress in rice.
   - **OsMADS27** is one of the ANR1-like homologues in rice, whreas its functions in plant growth and development as well as the abiotic stress responses remain unclear.
   - More importantly, **OsMADS27** overexpression could enhance the salt tolerance.
   - Moreover, under NO3- conditions, higher levels of ABA accumulates in **OsMADS27** overexpression plants.
   - Furthermore, **OsMADS27** overexpression promoted NO3- accumulation as well as the expression of NO3- transporter genes.
   - In this study, we identified functions of a nitrate-responsive miR444:MADS-box transcription factor **OsMADS27** module and its downstream targets mediating rice root growth and stress responses.
   - Although miR444 has the potential to target multiple genes, we identified **OsMADS27** as the major miR444 target that regulates the expression of nitrate transporters, as well as several key genes including expansins, and those associated with auxin signalling, to promote root growth.
   - In agreement with this, overexpression of miRNA-resistant **OsMADS27** improved root development and tolerance to abiotic stresses, while its silencing suppressed root growth.
   - **OsMADS27** mediated robust stress tolerance in plants through its ability to bind to the promoters of specific stress regulators, as observed in ChIP-seq analysis.
   - Our results reveal the role of nitrate-responsive **OsMADS27** and its downstream target genes in salt tolerance, providing a molecular mechanism for the enhancement of salt tolerance by nitrogen fertilizers in rice.
   - **OsMADS27** overexpression increased grain yield under salt stress in the presence of sufficient nitrate, suggesting that **OsMADS27** is a promising candidate for the improvement of salt tolerance in rice.
   - Nitrate-responsive **OsMADS27** promotes salt tolerance in rice..
   - Here, we show that nitrate-dependent salt tolerance is mediated by **OsMADS27** in rice.
   - **OsMADS27** knockout mutants are more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type, whereas **OsMADS27** overexpression lines are more tolerant.
   - Transcriptomic analyses revealed that **OsMADS27** upregulates the expression of a number of known stress-responsive genes as well as those involved in ion homeostasis and antioxidation.
   - The expression of **OsMADS27** is specifically induced by nitrate.
   - The salt-inducible expression of **OsMADS27** is also nitrate dependent.
