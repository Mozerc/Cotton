## Functional Descriptions:
   - The transcription factor **OsbHLH035** mediates seed germination and enables seedling recovery from salt stress through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways, respectively.
   - The bHLH TF **OsbHLH035** is a salt-induced gene that is primarily expressed in germinating seeds and seedlings.
   - Moreover, **OsbHLH035** mutant seedlings are unable to recover from salt-stress treatment.
   - Consistently, sodium is over-accumulated in aerial tissues but slightly reduced in terrestrial tissues from **OsbHLH035** seedlings after salt treatment.
   - Furthermore, genetic complementation can restore both the delayed seed germination and the impaired recovery of salt-treated **OsbHLH035** seedlings to normal growth.
   - **OsbHLH035** mediates seed germination and seedling recovery after salt stress relief through the ABA-dependent and ABA-independent activation of OsHKT pathways, respectively.
   - **OsbHLH035** mutants show delayed seed germination, particularly under salt-stress conditions.
   - The expression of **OsbHLH035** is induced by drought and salinity.
   - In parallel, abscisic acid (ABA) contents are over-accumulated, and the expression of the ABA biosynthetic genes OsABA2 and OsAAO3 is upregulated; furthermore, compared with that in wild-type (WT) seedlings, the salt-induced expression of OsABA8ox1, an ABA catabolic gene, in germinating **OsbHLH035** mutant seeds is downregulated.
   - Stable expression of GFP-fused **OsbHLH035** in rice transgenic plants revealed that this protein is predominantly localized to the nucleus.
   - Tightly controlled expression of **OsbHLH35** is critical for anther development in rice.
   - Our data suggest that **OsbHLH35** plays an essential role in anther development in rice and the fine control of its expression is crucial to ensure proper seed production.
   - Rice transgenic plants expressing GUS reporter gene under the control of **OsbHLH35** promoter (p**OsbHLH35**::GUS) showed that this TF specifically accumulates in anthers at the meiosis stage and in other spikelet tissues.
   - Plants overexpressing **OsbHLH35** presented small and curved anthers, leading to a reduction of 72 % on seed production.
   - Yeast one-hybrid screening identified three members of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) family, OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF11, as transcriptional regulators of **OsbHLH35**.
