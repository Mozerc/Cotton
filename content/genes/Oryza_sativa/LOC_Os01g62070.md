## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identification of a rice metal tolerance protein **OsMTP11** as a manganese transporter.
   - Real time RT-PCR analysis demonstrated **OsMTP11** expression was substantially enhanced following 4 h under Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn treatments, suggesting possible roles of **OsMTP11** involvement in heavy metal stress responses.
   - DNA methylation assays of genomic DNA in rice treated with Cd, Zn, Ni, and Mn revealed that decreased DNA methylation levels were present in the **OsMTP11** promoter region, which was consistent with **OsMTP11** induced-expression patterns resulting from heavy metal stress.
   - This indicates their importance for **OsMTP11** function and is a starting point for refining transporter activity/specificity.
   - Knockdown of **OsMTP11** resulted in growth inhibition in the presence of high concentrations of Mn, and also led to increased accumulation of Mn in the shoots and roots.
   - The expression of **OsMTP11** was found to enhance Mn tolerance in the Mn-sensitive yeast mutant pmr1.
   - The overexpression of **OsMTP11** was found to enhance Mn tolerance in rice, and under supplementation with a toxic level of Mn, decreased Mn concentration was observed in the shoots and roots.
   - These findings suggest that **OsMTP11** is a TGN-localized Mn transporter that is required for Mn homeostasis and contributes towards Mn tolerance in rice.
   - Here we report on the rice gene **OsMTP11** that encodes a putative CDF transporter that is homologous to members of the Mn-CDF cluster.
   - Subcellular localization in rice protoplasts and tobacco epidermal cells revealed that **OsMTP11** localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and a significant relocalization to the plasma membrane can be triggered by high extracellular Mn in tobacco epidermal cells.
