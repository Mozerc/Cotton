## Functional Descriptions:
   - The ATP-binding cassette transporter **OsPDR1** regulates plant growth and pathogen resistance by affecting jasmonates biosynthesis in rice.
   - In addition, overexpression and mutation of **OsPDR1** resulted in decreased and increased plant growth at seedling stage, respectively, but eventually led to decreased grain yield.
   - 3-overexpressing plants exhibited higher JAs content and stronger growth inhibition and disease resistance than **OsPDR1**.
   - By affecting JAs biosynthesis, overexpression of **OsPDR1** resulted in constitutive activation of defense-related genes and enhanced resistance to bacterial blight, whereas its mutation decreased pathogen resistance.
   - These results indicated that alternative splicing affects the function of **OsPDR1** gene in regulation of growth, development and disease resistance.
   - The three **OsPDR1** transcripts are developmentally controlled and differentially regulated by JAs and pathogen infection.
