## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we isolated and characterized the rice **OsFIGNL1** (OsFidgetin-like 1) gene, encoding a conserved AAA-ATPase, and explored its function and importance in male meiosis and pollen formation.
   - The rice **OsFIGNL1** mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth, but failed to produce seeds and displayed pollen abortion phenotype.
   - Phenotypic comparisons between the wild-type and **OsFIGNL1** mutant demonstrated that **OsFIGNL1** is required for anther development, and that the recessive mutation of this gene causes male sterility in rice.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that **OsFIGNL1** plays an important role in regulation of male meiosis and anther development.
   - Complementation and CRISPR/Cas9 experiments demonstrated that wild-type **OsFIGNL1** is responsible for the male sterility phenotype.
   - Male meiosis in the **OsFIGNL1** mutant exhibited abnormal chromosome behavior, including chromosome bridges and multivalent chromosomes at diakinesis, lagging chromosomes, and chromosome fragments during meiosis.
