## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ability of Rf5 and **RF6** to Restore Fertility of Chinsurah Boro II-type Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Oryza Sativa (ssp. Japonica) Lines.
   - The BT-type F(1) hybrids with either Rf5 or **RF6** exhibited normal seed setting rates, but F(1) plants carrying **RF6** showed more stable seed setting rates than those of plants carrying Rf5 under heat-stress conditions.
   - Furthermore, the seed setting rates of F(1) hybrids carrying both Rf5 and **RF6** were more stable than that of F(1) plants carrying only one Rf gene.
   - CONCLUSION: **RF6** is an important genetic resource for the breeding of BT-type japonica restorer lines.
   - **RF6** is targeted to mitochondria, where it physically associates with hexokinase 6 (OsHXK6) and promotes the processing of the aberrant CMS-associated transcript atp6-orfH79 at nucleotide 1238, which ensures normal pollen development and restores fertility.
   - The duplicated motif 3 of **RF6** is essential for **RF6**-OsHXK6 interactions, processing of the aberrant transcript, and restoration of fertility.
   - Together these results reveal a novel mechanism for CMS restoration by which **RF6** functions with OsHXK6 to restore HL-CMS fertility.
   - The HL-CMS trait is associated with an aberrant chimeric mitochondrial transcript, atp6-orfH79, which causes pollen sterility and can be rescued by two nonallelic restorer-of-fertility (Rf) genes, Rf5 or **RF6**.
   - Pentatricopeptide-repeat family protein **RF6** functions with hexokinase 6 to rescue rice cytoplasmic male sterility.
