## Functional Descriptions:
   - Microarray analysis combined with gene ontology analysis revealed that **OsPIL15** represses a set of genes involved in auxin pathways and cell wall organization or biogenesis.
   - Given the important roles of the auxin pathway and cell wall properties in controlling plant growth, we speculate that **OsPIL15** represses seedling growth likely by regulating the auxin pathway and suppressing cell wall organization in etiolated rice seedlings.
   - It was found that the expression of OsPIL13 is under the control of circadian rhythms (clock), while the expression of **OsPIL15** is negatively regulated by light upon the onset to light exposure of etiolated seedlings.
   - **OsPIL15**-OX seedlings exhibit an exaggerated shorter aboveground part and undeveloped root system relative to wild-type seedlings, suggesting that **OsPIL15** represses seedling growth in the dark.
   - Additionally, exposure to red light or far-red light relieved growth retardation and promoted seedling elongation in the **OsPIL15**-OX lines, despite higher levels of **OsPIL15** transcripts under red light and far-red light than in the dark.
   - Overexpression of **OsPIL15**, a phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein gene, represses etiolated seedling growth in rice.
   - An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with OsPIL13 and **OsPIL15**.
   - In addition, OsPIL13 and **OsPIL15** colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function.
   - Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with OsPIL13 and **OsPIL15** and thus induce late flowering.
   - The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, **OsPIL15** regulates grain size via directly targeting a purine permease gene OsPUP7 in rice.
   - Here we firstly analyzed the expression pattern of rice OsPIL genes in grains and found that **OsPIL15** may play an important role in grain development.
   - We then generated knock-out (KO) **OsPIL15** lines in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the silencing expression of **OsPIL15** led to increased numbers of cells, which thus enhanced grain size and weight.
   - Moreover, overexpression and suppression of **OsPIL15** in the rice endosperm resulted in brown rice showing grain sizes and weights that were decreased and increased, respectively.
   - Overall, our results demonstrate a possible pathway whereby **OsPIL15** directly targets OsPUP7, affecting CTK transport and thereby influencing cell division and subsequent grain size.
   - These findings provide a valuable insight into the molecular functions of **OsPIL15** in rice grains, highlighting a useful genetic improvement leading to increased rice yield.
   - Dominant-negative **OsPIL15** plants displayed a larger tiller angle, which was associated with reduced shoot gravitropism.
   - Phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein **OsPIL15** integrates light and gravitropism to regulate tiller angle in rice.
   - Rice phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein **OsPIL15** regulates tiller angle through light and gravity signals in rice.
   - Here, we report that **OsPIL15** is, indeed, a rice PIF that negatively regulates tiller angle.
   - We propose that **OsPIL15** integrates light and gravity signals to regulate tiller angle in rice.
