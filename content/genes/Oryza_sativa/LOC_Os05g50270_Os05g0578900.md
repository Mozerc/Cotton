## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **NL1** gene encodes a GATA-type transcription factor with a single zinc finger domain, and its transcripts are detected predominantly in the bract primordia, which normally degenerate in the wild-type plants.
   - To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we cloned the rice gene NECK LEAF 1 (**NL1**), which when mutated results in delays in flowering time, smaller panicles with overgrown bracts and abnormal UPI elongation patterns.
   - Furthermore, the expression of two regulators of flowering, Hd3a and OsMADS1, was also affected in the **NL1** mutant.
   - Overexpression of **NL1** in transgenic plants often gives rise to severe growth retardation, less vegetative phytomers and smaller leaves, suggesting that **NL1** plays an important role in organ differentiation.
   - On the basis of these findings, we propose that **NL1** is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of PLA1 and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice.
   - Histological analysis showed that the length of epidermal cells and number of longitudinal veins were decreased in the flag leaf of the **SNFL1** mutant.
   - Analysis of RT-PCR and the **SNFL1** promoter by means of a GUS fusion expression assay showed that abundance of **SNFL1** transcripts was higher in the culm, leaf sheath, and root.
   - We conclude that **SNFL1** is an important regulator of leaf development, the identification of which might have important implications for future research on GATA transcription factors.
   - Map-based cloning indicated that a member of the GATA family of transcription factors is a candidate gene for **SNFL1**.
   - Expression of the **SNFL1**-GFP fusion protein in rice protoplasts showed that **SNFL1** was localized in nucleus.
