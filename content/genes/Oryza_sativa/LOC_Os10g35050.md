- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cross-talk between ABA and sugar signaling is mediated by the ACGT core and CE1 element reciprocally in **OsTIP3;1** promoter.
   - Such a stimulatory increase in **OsTIP3;1** expression under sugar-starvation is possibly not owing to changes in endogenous ABA content.
   - The transient expression assay indicated that the 5' flanking region of **OsTIP3;1** delivered similar collaborative responsiveness to starvation and ABA, suggesting that this gene promoter could be a good molecular probe to examine the interaction between sugar and ABA signaling pathways.
   - ABI4 expression was also enhanced by sugars and repressed by ABA, suggesting that reduced ABI4 binding to CE1 in the absence of sugar and presence of ABA could increase ABA-induction of the **OsTIP3;1** promoter activity.
   - Targeted mutagenesis demonstrated that disruption of ACGT cores decreased the induction of **OsTIP3;1** promoter activity under either starvation or ABA, whereas mutation of coupling element 1 (CE1), which is an ABI4 binding site, reversely increased it, suggesting that those two distinct cis-regulatory elements reciprocally regulate the responsiveness of this promoter to both sugar and ABA.
