## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcript levels of three flowering regulators-**Ehd1**, OsMADS14, and Hd3a-were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were unchanged.
   - These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of **Ehd1**, OsMADS14, and Hd3a.
   - To further investigate the relationship with other flowering promoters, we generated transgenic plants in which expression of **Ehd1** or OsGI was suppressed.
   - In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to **Ehd1**.
   - OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of **Ehd1**, OsMADS14, and Hd3a.
   - Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed **Ehd1** the next morning.
   - These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-**Ehd1** in regulating LD-dependent flowering.
   - Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating **Ehd1**.
   - These results provide direct evidence that phytochromes inhibit flowering by affecting both Hd1 and **Ehd1** flowering pathways.
   - Early heading date1 (**Ehd1**), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses **Ehd1** in wild-type plants.
   - Since the two genes Se1 (= Hd1) and Ef1 (= **Ehd1**) are known to up-regulate the rice homolog of Arabidopsis FT, it is suggested that the detected epistasis may respond to diverse environments by modulating the CO/FT system conserved in flowering plants.
   - We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and **Ehd1**) and negative (Hd1, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice.
   - Among these regulators, **Ehd1**, a rice-specific floral inducer, integrates multiple pathways to regulate RFT1, leading to flowering under appropriate photoperiod conditions.
   - Therefore, two key flowering time genes, Hd1 and **Ehd1**, can control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the field through florigen expression in leaf.
   - We further revealed that Hd1 and/or **Ehd1** caused up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle development.
   - OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of **Ehd1** and downstream of OsphyB.
   - The results revealed that the combination of Heading-date 1 (Hd1) and Early heading date 1 (**Ehd1**) can reduce the number of primary branches in a panicle, resulting in smaller spikelet numbers per panicle; this occurs independently of the control of flowering time.
   - By regulating **Ehd1**, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions.
   - The comparison of the nucleotide sequences suggested that Ef1 is the same as Early heading date 1 (**Ehd1**).
   - Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream **Ehd1** and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction.
   - We examined the footprints of natural and artificial selections for four major genes of the photoperiod pathway, namely PHYTOCHROME B (PhyB), HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a), and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (**Ehd1**), by investigation of the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms in cultivated and wild rice.
   - Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (**Ehd1**, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome).
   - The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of **Ehd1** (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions.
   - In this study, it was found that the flowering promoting gene **Ehd1** and its putative downstream genes were all repressed by OsLFL1.
   - On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT-like genes and by downregulation of **Ehd1** by the flowering repressor Ghd7 - a unique pathway in rice.
   - Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher **Ehd1** transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of **Ehd1**.
   - We also found that LHD1 could down-regulate the expression of several floral transition activators such as **Ehd1**, Hd3a and RFT1 under long-day conditions, but not under short-day conditions.
   - OsId1 regulates the expression of **Ehd1** (Early heading date 1) and its downstream genes, including Hd3a (a rice ortholog of FT) and RFT1 (Rice Flowering Locus T1), under both SD and LD conditions.
   - In rice, the expression of **Ehd1** is also controlled by the photoperiodic flowering genes OsGI (a rice ortholog of GI) and OsMADS51.
   - This study demonstrates that the activation of **Ehd1** by OsId1 is required for the promotion of flowering.
   - In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (**Ehd1**) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions.
   - Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of **Ehd1**, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4).
   - **Ehd1** and Hd3a can also be down-regulated by the photoperiodic flowering genes Ghd7 and Hd1 (a rice ortholog of CONSTANS).
   - Thus, two distinct gating mechanisms--of the floral promoter **Ehd1** and the floral repressor Ghd7--could enable manipulation of slight differences in day length to control Hd3a transcription with a critical day-length threshold.
   - Here, we report that the rice Early heading date 1 (**Ehd1**) gene, which confers SD promotion of flowering in the absence of a functional allele of Hd1, encodes a B-type response regulator that might not have an ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome.
   - **Ehd1** mRNA was induced by 1-wk SD treatment, and **Ehd1** may promote flowering by inducing FT-like gene expression only under SD conditions.
   - **Ehd1**, a B-type response regulator in rice, confers short-day promotion of flowering and controls FT-like gene expression independently of Hd1.
   - As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing **Ehd1** expression.
   - In addition, expression of the Hd3a and Rice Flowering-locus T 1 (RFT1) florigen genes was up-regulated in leaves of the Hd1 **Ehd1** line at the time of the floral transition.
   - To assign the position of Ehd2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such as **Ehd1**, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT-like1 (RFT1; rice florigens), between the wild-type plants and the ehd2 mutants.
   - Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating **Ehd1** and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice.
   - Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating **Ehd1**.
   - We also found that the type of Hd3a promoter and the level of **Ehd1** expression contribute to the diversity in flowering time and Hd3a expression level.
   - Variations in Hd1 proteins, Hd3a promoters, and **Ehd1** expression levels contribute to diversity of flowering time in cultivated rice.
   - Knockdown of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression of the flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (**Ehd1**), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT-like genes).
   - Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of **Ehd1** (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod.
   - We grew four rice lines having different flowering time genotypes (hd1 **Ehd1**, hd1 **Ehd1**, Hd1 **Ehd1** and Hd1 **Ehd1**) under distinct photoperiod conditions.
   - This indicates that LHD1 may delay flowering by repressing the expression of **Ehd1**, Hd3a and RFT1 under long-day conditions.
   - However, in rice, there is a unique **Ehd1**-dependent flowering pathway that is Hd1-independent.
   - We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of **Ehd1**, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice.
   - The expression of Hd3a and FTL decreased in these transgenic plants, whereas the expression of Hd1, Early heading date 1 (**Ehd1**), OsMADS51, and OsMADS50 did not significantly change.
   - Hd3a expression is induced by **Ehd1** (Early heading date 1) expression when blue light coincides with the morning phase set by OsGIGANTEA(OsGI)-dependent circadian clocks.
   - The Early heading date 1 (**Ehd1**) which promotes the RFT1, was up-regulated by DTH3 in both LD and SD conditions.
   - We identified a nonfunctional RFT1 allele (rft1); the lines carrying homozygous **Ehd1** and Hd3a/rft1 failed to induce the floral transition under SD and LD conditions.
   - Both Hd1 and **Ehd1** are important for artificial selection of flowering time in cultivated rice..
   - Both Hd1 and **Ehd1** may be important during artificial selection for flowering time, especially in a subtropical region such as Taiwan.
