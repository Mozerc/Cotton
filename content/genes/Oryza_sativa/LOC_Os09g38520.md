- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Moreover, plant growth and grain yield of rss5 and the **OsCYBDOMG1** knockout mutant (cr-1) were significantly decreased compared to wild-type plants under normal conditions.
   - **OsCYBDOMG1** positively regulates salt tolerance, plant growth, and grain yield by affecting ascorbate biosynthesis and redox state.
   - The elite haplotype of **OsCYBDOMG1** associated with higher salt tolerance and grain width and weight was mainly existed in japonica varieties.
   - These results suggest that **OsCYBDOMG1** plays an important role in the regulation of salt tolerance, plant growth, and grain yield in rice.
   - Mutations of **OsCYBDOMG1** resulted in decreased ascorbic acid (AsA) content and AsA/DHA (dehydroascorbate) ratio, which led to increased H(2)O(2) accumulation and reduced salt tolerance.
   - The **OsCYBDOMG1** gene was mainly expressed in young shoots and nodes, and the encoded protein was principally located in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum.
