## Functional Descriptions:
   - Northern analysis revealed that the level of OS-ETR2 mRNA was markedly elevated either by the exogenous application of IAA or by ethylene treatment in young etiolated rice seedlings, whereas the **Os-ERS1** transcript level was only slightly induced under the same experimental conditions.
   - Pretreatment with silver prevented IAA-induced and ethylene-induced accumulation of both mRNAs (**Os-ERS1** and OS-ETR2).
   - Five ethylene receptor genes, **Os-ERS1**, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice.
   - Deduced amino acid sequences of **Os-ERS1**, OS-ERS2, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species.
   - Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which **Os-ERS1** was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-ERS2 and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice.
   - Our results and others support the notion that OsERS1 and OsETR2 could have different roles during rice plant submergence.
   - The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and OsETR2 and their Potential Role during Submergence.
   - OsERS1 and OsETR2 are major ethylene receptors in rice that have been reported to have different regulatory functions.
   - Base on the results, we suggested that OsERS1 could be localized to plasma membranes, whereas OsETR2 could be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.
