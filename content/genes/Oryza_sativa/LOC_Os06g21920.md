## Functional Descriptions:
   - Conversely, although no alterations in Pi concentration were found in **OsPT9** or OsPT10 knockdown plants, a significant reduction in Pi concentration in both shoots and roots was observed in double-knockdown plants grown under both high- and low-Pi conditions.
   - **OsPT9** and OsPT10 were expressed in the root epidermis, root hairs and lateral roots, with their expression being specifically induced by Pi starvation.
   - High-affinity Km values for Pi transport of **OsPT9** and OsPT10 were determined by yeast experiments and two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of anion transport in Xenopus oocytes expressing **OsPT9** and OsPT10.
   - Pi uptake and Pi concentrations in transgenic plants harbouring overexpressed **OsPT9** and OsPT10 were determined by Pi concentration analysis and (33) P-labelled Pi uptake rate analysis.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that **OsPT9** and OsPT10 redundantly function in Pi uptake.
   - We characterized the function of two rice phosphate (Pi) transporters: **OsPht1;9** (OsPT9) and OsPHT1;10 (OsPT10).
   - Phosphate transporters **OsPht1;9** and OsPHT1;10 are involved in phosphate uptake in rice.
