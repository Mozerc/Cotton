## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsIspF** was expressed in all tissues detected, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast.
   - **OsIspF** gene was expressed in all tissues detected, and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast.
   - By map-based cloning of this mutant, we identified **OsIspF** gene (LOC_Os02g45660) showing significant similarity to IspF gene of Arabidopsis, in which a missense mutation occurred in the mutant, resulting in an amino acid change in the encoded protein.
