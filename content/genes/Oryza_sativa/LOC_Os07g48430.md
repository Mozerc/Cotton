## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g48430](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g48430)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0682800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0682800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>rth1</u>&nbsp;<u>OsAPY</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic plants with introduced **OsAPY** allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype.
   - **OsAPY** appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice.
   - We concluded that the root hairless phenotype of rth1 is caused by a mutation of **OsAPY**.
   - To better understand genetic control of root hair formation in rice, we analyzed root hairless 1 (**rth1**) mutant that was induced by NaN3 treatment.
   - SEM observation showed that in **rth1** plants, root hair elongation was abolished after the formation of bulge.
   - Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene **rth1** in rice.
