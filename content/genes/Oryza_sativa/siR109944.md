## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>siR109944</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Additionally, multiple agronomic traits of rice, including root length and flag leaf inclination, were affected by **siR109944** expression.
   - Our results demonstrate that **siR109944** has a conserved function in interfering with plant immunity, growth and development by affecting auxin homeostasis in planta.
   - Rice **siR109944** suppresses plant immunity to sheath blight and impacts multiple agronomic traits by affecting auxin homeostasis.
   - Auxin metabolism- and signaling pathway-related genes were differentially expressed in the **siR109944** OE and FBL55 OE plants.
   - We found that rice had significantly enhanced susceptibility when **siR109944** was overexpressed, while FBL55 OE plants showed resistance to R.
   - Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing **siR109944** exhibited early flowering, increased tiller numbers and increased susceptibility to R.
   - Thus, **siR109944** provides a genetic target for plant breeding in the future.
