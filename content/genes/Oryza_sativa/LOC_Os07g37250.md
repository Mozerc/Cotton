## Functional Descriptions:
   - From a rice mutant population generated by ionizing radiation, we isolated **NYC4**-1, a stay-green mutant with a defect in chlorophyll breakdown during leaf senescence.
   - Western blot analysis revealed that, in **NYC4**-1, the PSII core subunits D1 and D2 were significantly retained during leaf senescence in comparison with wild-type and other non-functional stay-green mutants, including sgr-2, a mutant of the key regulator of chlorophyll degradation SGR.
   - The role of **NYC4** in degradation of chlorophyll and chlorophyll - protein complexes during leaf senescence is discussed.
   - **NYC4**, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis THF1, is involved in the degradation of chlorophyll - protein complexes during leaf senescence.
