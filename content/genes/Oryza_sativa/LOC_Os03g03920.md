## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Ubiquitin-Binding Protein **OsDSK2a** Mediates Seedling Growth and Salt Responses by Regulating Gibberellin Metabolism in Rice.
   - Here, we demonstrate that the novel UBL-UBA protein **OsDSK2a** (DOMINANT SUPPRESSOR of KAR2) mediates seedling growth and salt responses in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Bioactive GA levels were reduced and plant growth was retarded in the **OsDSK2a** mutant.
   - Thus, **OsDSK2a** and EUI play opposite roles in regulating plant growth under salt stress by affecting GA metabolism.
   - Downregulation of the ubiquitin-binding receptor **OsDSK2a** increases EUI accumulation, which promotes GA metabolism and reduces plant growth under salt stress.
   - Through analysis of **OsDSK2a**, a mutant with retarded seedling growth, as well as in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that **OsDSK2a** combines with polyubiquitin chains and interacts with the gibberellin (GA)-deactivating enzyme ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE (EUI), resulting in its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.
   - **OsDSK2a** levels decreased in plant under salt stress.
   - Moreover, EUI accumulated under salt stress more rapidly in **OsDSK2a** than in wild-type plants.
