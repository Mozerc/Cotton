- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g19080](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g19080)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0302900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0302900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** SSD1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SSD1** exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers.
   - In this study we analyzed a novel dwarf mutant, **SSD1**, of which phenotype is different from typical GA- or BR-related dwarf phenotype.
   - Map-based cloning and complementation test demonstrated that the dwarf phenotype in **SSD1** mutant was caused by insertion of retrotransposon in a gene, which encodes plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function.
   - **SSD1** also shows abnormal cell files and shapes, which suggests defects of normal cell division in the mutant.
   - Our results demonstrate that **SSD1** controls plant elongation by controlling cell division in higher plants.
   - **SSD1**, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice.
