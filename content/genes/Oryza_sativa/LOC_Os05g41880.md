- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsMSH5</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The synaptonemal complex is well installed in **OsMSH5**, while the chiasma frequency is greatly reduced to approximately 10% of that observed in the wild-type, leading to the homologous non-disjunction and complete sterile phenotype.
   - Immunofluorescence studies indicate that **OsMSH5** chromosomal localization is limited to the early meiotic prophase I.
   - **OsMSH5** can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10.
   - Here, we report the identification and characterization of its rice homolog, **OsMSH5**, and demonstrate its function in rice meiosis.
   - The role of **OsMSH5** in crossover formation during rice meiosis.
   - **OsMSH5** is predominantly expressed in panicles.
   - Five independent **OsMSH5** mutants exhibited normal vegetative growth and severe sterility.
   - The MSH4-MSH5 heterodimer has been demonstrated in mammals to stabilize the formation of progenitor and double Holliday junctions that may be resolved as crossovers (COs).
