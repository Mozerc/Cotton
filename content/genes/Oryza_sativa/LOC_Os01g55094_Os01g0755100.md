- **Gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g55094](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g55094)  &nbsp;,&nbsp; [Os01g0755100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0755100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** AMD1,PWA1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **AMD1** encodes a grass-specific protein exhibiting transactivation activity in the nucleus and is spatiotemporally expressed in the tapetum and microspores during pollen development.
   - Taken together, we demonstrate that **AMD1** is an important regulatory component involved in the TDR-mediated regulatory pathway to regulate sporopollenin biosynthesis, tapetum degradation, and exine formation for pollen development.
   - Further biochemical assays indicate that **AMD1** directly activates the transcription of DEFECTIVE POLLEN WALL (DPW) and POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE2 (OsPKS2), which are both implicated in sporopollenin biosynthesis during exine formation.
   - Additionally, **AMD1** directly interacts with TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR), a key TF involved in the regulation of tapetum degradation and exine formation.
   - **PWA1** interacted with the transcription factor TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (TDR)-INTERACTING PROTEIN2 (TIP2, also named bHLH142) in vivo and in vitro.
   - Further studies suggested that **PWA1** has transcriptional activation activity and participates in pollen intine development through the Î²-glucosidase Os12BGlu38.
   - Map-based cloning, genetic complementation, and gene knockout experiments revealed that **PWA1** corresponds to the gene LOC_Os01g55094 encoding a coiled-coil domain-containing protein.
   - **PWA1** localized to the nucleus, and **PWA1** was expressed in the tapetum and microspores.
