## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os05g50380](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g50380)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0580000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0580000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsAPL3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Interestingly, ABA alone did not affect the gene expression of **OsAPL3** and starch content.
   - Collectively, these results indicated that the expression level of **OsAPL3** and starch content in the cultured cells were cooperatively controlled by alterations in the concentration of both sucrose and ABA.
   - **OsAPL3** was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development.
