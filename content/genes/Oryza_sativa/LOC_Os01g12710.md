- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0227100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0227100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NYC1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ultrastructural analysis of **NYC1** chloroplasts revealed that large and thick grana were present even in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that degradation of LHCII is required for the proper degeneration of thylakoid membranes.
   - Map-based cloning of **NYC1** revealed that it encodes a chloroplast-localized short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) with three transmembrane domains.
   - Analysis of the **NYC1** mutant, which shows the stay-green phenotype, revealed that chlorophyll b degradation is required for the degradation of light-harvesting complex II and thylakoid grana in leaf senescence.
   - Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and **NYC1**-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice.
   - non-yellow coloring1 (**NYC1**) is a rice (Oryza sativa) stay-green mutant in which chlorophyll degradation during senescence is impaired.
   - Pigment analysis revealed that degradation of not only chlorophylls but also light-harvesting complex II (LHCII)-bound carotenoids was repressed in **NYC1**, in which most LHCII isoforms were selectively retained during senescence.
   - Our data collectively suggest that the identified SDR protein **NYC1** plays essential roles in the regulation of LHCII and thylakoid membrane degradation during senescence.
