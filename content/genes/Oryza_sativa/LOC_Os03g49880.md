## Functional Descriptions:
   - We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of **OsTB1** and exhibits enhanced lateral branching.
   - The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (**OsTB1**) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to **OsTB1**, which finally controlled tillering.
   - We propose that **FC1** acts as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways and is essential to the fine-tuning of shoot branching in rice.
   - On the other hand, the expression level of **FC1** is negatively regulated by cytokinin treatment.
   - Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with **OsTB1** (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice.
   - Expression of **OsTB1**, as examined with a putative promoter-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion, was observed throughout the axillary bud, as well as the basal part of the shoot apical meristem, vascular tissues in the pith and the lamina joint.
   - An in situ hybridization analysis showed that **FC1** mRNA accumulates in axillary buds, the shoot apical meristem, young leaves, vascular tissues and the tips of crown roots.
   - We found that the increased tillering phenotype of fine culm1 (**FC1**) mutants of rice is not rescued by the application of 1 microM GR24, a synthetic SL analog.
   - Treatment with a high concentration of GR24 (10 microM) causes suppression of tiller growth in wild-type plants, but is not effective on **FC1** mutants, implying that proper **FC1** functioning is required for SLs to inhibit bud growth.
   - Overexpression of **FC1** partially rescued d3-2 defects in the tiller growth and plant height.
   - The rice TB1 gene (**OsTB1**) was first identified based on its sequence similarity with maize TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB1), which is involved in lateral branching in maize.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsTB1** exhibited markedly reduced lateral branching without the propagation of axillary buds being affected.
   - Taking these data together, we concluded that **OsTB1** functions as a negative regulator for lateral branching in rice, presumably through expression in axillary buds.
   - The **OsTB1** gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice.
   - FINE CULM1 (**FC1**) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice.
   - Therefore, OsMIR444a-regulated OsMADS57, together with **OsTB1**, target D14 to control tillering.
   - The interaction between OsMADS57 and **OsTB1** modulates rice tillering via DWARF14.
   - In addition, we present observations that suggest that FINE CULM1 (**FC1**), a rice ortholog of teosinte branched 1 (tb1), possibly works independently of the branching inhibitor pathway.
   - Our study of a locus involved in resistance to lodging demonstrated that saturation editing of the qSCSA3-1/**OsTB1**/SCM3 region led to loss-of-function, normal-like, and gain-of-function plant types, based on **OsTB1** expression and stem cross-section area.
   - One gain-of-function allele recapitulated a previously described beneficial allele of **OsTB1** carrying a TGTG insertion in the 5' region of **OsTB1** and enhanced **OsTB1** expression at the inflorescence formation stage.
   - We propose that mildly enhanced tillering by in-frame mutation of **OsTB1** can improve grain yield under low phosphorus conditions.
   - In contrast, in-frame mutations in **OsTB1** had the effect of slightly increasing tiller numbers, and the in-frame mutants had 40% more panicles than non-mutated plants.
   - Our findings show that the moderately increased panicle number combined with large-sized panicles using **MP3** could be a novel IPA and contribute to an increase in rice production under climate change with rising atmospheric CO(2) levels.
   - MP3 is a natural allele of **OsTB1**/FC1, previously reported as a negative regulator of tiller bud outgrowth.
   - No selective sweep at **MP3** in either the temperate japonica or indica subgroups suggested that **MP3** has not been involved and utilized in artificial selection during domestication or breeding.
