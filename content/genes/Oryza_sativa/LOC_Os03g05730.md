- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0151800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0151800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsCDC48</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsCDC48** was expressed constitutively in the root, stem, leaf and panicle.
   - Single base substitution in **OsCDC48** is responsible for premature senescence and death phenotype in rice.
   - Our results indicated that the impaired function of **OsCDC48** was responsible for the premature senescence and death phenotype.
   - Overexpression of **OsCDC48**-psd128 resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased plant tiller numbers while overexpression of **OsCDC48** also resulted in differential expression of AAA-ATPase associated genes leading to increased total ATPase activity, but increased plant tiller numbers and grain yield, indicating its potential utilization for yield improvement.
   - We demonstrate that the C-terminus of **OsCDC48** is essential for maintaining its full ATPase activity and **OsCDC48**/48E interaction is required to modulate cellular processes and plant survival in rice.
   - Our results demonstrated that the C-terminal region of **OsCDC48** was essential for maintaining the full ATPase activity and **OsCDC48**/48E complex might function in form of heteromultimers to modulate cellular processes and plant survival in rice.
   - Removal of the C-terminus of **OsCDC48** caused altered expression of cell cycle-related genes, changed the percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, and abolished the interaction between **OsCDC48** itself and between **OsCDC48** and **OsCDC48**E, respectively.
