## Functional Descriptions:
   - **LC2** is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids.
   - The **LC2** gene was isolated through positional cloning, and encodes a vernalization insensitive 3-like protein.
   - Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (**OsVIL3**) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering.
   - Interestingly, **LC2** binds to the promoter region of a floral repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27 tri-methylation modification.
   - These results first demonstrated that the putative PRC2 in rice is involved in photoperiod flowering regulation, which is different from that of Arabidopsis, and revealed that **LC2** binds the promoter region of target gene, presenting a possible mechanism of the recruitment process of PRC2 complex to its target genes.
   - **LC2** and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF.
   - To understand the molecular mechanism controlling rice leaf angles, one rice leaf inclination2 (**LC2**, three alleles) mutant was identified and functionally characterized.
   - Compared to wild-type plants, **LC2** mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint.
   - Complementary expression of **LC2** reversed the enlarged leaf angles of **LC2** plants, confirming its role in controlling leaf inclination.
   - **LC2** is localized in the nucleus and defects of **LC2** result in altered expression of cell division and hormone-responsive genes, indicating an important role of **LC2** in regulating leaf inclination and mediating hormone effects.
   - Our results showed that expressions of **LC2** and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both **LC2** mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a.
