## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsSRO1c**-1 mutant showed resistance not only to chloroplastic oxidative stress, but also to apoplastic oxidative stress.
   - Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed **OsSRO1c**, was identified as a direct target gene of SNAC1 (stress-responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response.
   - Interestingly, **OsSRO1c**-overexpressing rice showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress.
   - **OsSRO1c** interacted with various stress-related regulatory and functional proteins, and some of the **OsSRO1c**-interacting proteins are predicted to be involved in the control of stomatal aperture and oxidative stress tolerance.
   - The results suggest that **OsSRO1c** has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST.
   - The SNAC1-targeted gene **OsSRO1c** modulates stomatal closure and oxidative stress tolerance by regulating hydrogen peroxide in rice.
   - When compared with the well-characterized Arabidopsis SRO protein radical-induced cell death 1 (RCD1), **OsSRO1c** has considerable variation in the protein sequence, and the two genes exhibit different expression profiles under abiotic stresses.
   - However, the **OsSRO1c**-1 mutant and artificial microRNA-**OsSRO1c** transgenic rice were significantly impaired in cold tolerance.
   - Expression analysis of rice SRO genes in response to various abiotic stresses showed that **OsSRO1c**, a rice SRO gene which functions downstream of the stress-responsive transcription factor SNAC1, is the major stress-responsive gene in the rice SRO family.
   - Furthermore, **OsSRO1c**-1 and rcd1 showed different responses to multiple abiotic stresses.
   - The data presented in this report provide important clues for further elucidating the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of **OsSRO1c** in mediating responses to multiple abiotic stresses.
   - A special member of the rice SRO family, **OsSRO1c**, mediates responses to multiple abiotic stresses through interaction with various transcription factors.
   - The loss-of-function mutant of **OsSRO1c** showed increased stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought, and faster water loss compared with the wild-type plant, whereas **OsSRO1c** overexpression led to decreased stomatal aperture and reduced water loss.
   - **OsSRO1c** was induced in guard cells by drought stress.
   - By screening an Arabidopsis transcription factor library, 29 transcription factors interacted with **OsSRO1c** in yeast, but only two of these transcription factors were reported to interact with RCD1, which may partly explain the different responses of the two mutants under various stresses.
   - **BOC1** may decrease cell senescence and death caused by oxidative stress.
   - We show that **BOC1** encodes a SIMILAR TO RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH ONE (SRO) protein.
   - A common wild rice-derived **BOC1** allele reduces callus browning in indica rice transformation..
