## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g61680](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g61680)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0832300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0832300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsHYPK
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We found that loss of **OsHYPK** function leads to developmental defects in rice plant architecture but increased resistance to abiotic stresses, attributable to perturbation of the N-terminal acetylomeÂ and accelerated global protein turnover.
   - Furthermore, we demonstrated that **OsHYPK** is also a substrate of NatA and that N-terminal acetylation of **OsHYPK** promotes its own degradation, probably through the Ac/N-degron pathway, which could be induced by abiotic stresses.
