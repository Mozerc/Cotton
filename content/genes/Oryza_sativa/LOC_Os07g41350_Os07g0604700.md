## Functional Descriptions:
   - Among the six OsB12Ds, **OsB12D1** is one of the major transcripts and is primarily expressed in germinating seed and root.
   - Bioinformatics analyses indicated that **OsB12D1** is an anoxic or submergence resistance-related gene.
   - The mitochondrion-located protein **OsB12D1** enhances flooding tolerance during seed germination and early seedling growth in rice..
   - RT-PCR results showed **OsB12D1** is induced remarkably in the coleoptiles or roots by flooding during seed germination and early seedling growth.
   - This work indicated that **OsB12D1** is a promising gene that can help to enhance rice seedling establishment in farming practices, especially for direct seeding.
   - **OsB12D1** was identified in the mitochondrion by subcellular localization analysis and possibly enhances electron transport through mediating Fe and oxygen availability under flooded conditions.
