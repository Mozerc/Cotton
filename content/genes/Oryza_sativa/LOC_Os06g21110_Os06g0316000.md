## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we conducted a promoter assay of **Os2H16** and identified GT-1 as an important cis-element that mediates **Os2H16** expression in response to pathogen attack and osmotic stress.
   - Overexpression of **Os2H16** enhances resistance to phytopathogens and tolerance to drought stress in rice.
   - In comparison with wild-type rice, transgenic lines overexpressing **Os2H16** show enhanced tolerance to bacterial blight and sheath blight disease, respectively caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - To further investigate the role of **Os2H16** in plant defense responses to abiotic and biotic stresses, transgenic lines of rice were developed.
   - Our study provides the first functional characterization of the rice **Os2H16** gene, and suggests that **Os2H16** positively modulate plant defense to abiotic and biotic stress.
   - In this study, expression patterns of **Os2H16** were analyzed, demonstrating that expression of **Os2H16** was dramatically induced by both bacterial and fungal infection as well as by drought stress, but repressed by salt treatment.
   - We also show that **Os2H16** overexpression lines display enhanced tolerance to drought stress and elevated induction of drought-related genes, compared to wild-type rice.
   - **Os2H16** knockdown lines were more sensitive to drought stress and exhibited reduced induction of drought-related genes.
