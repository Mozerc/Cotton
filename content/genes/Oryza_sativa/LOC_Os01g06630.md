- **Gene Symbol:** OsLEA1a
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptome analysis revealed **OsLEA1a** mainly expressed in embryos, with no or only a few transcripts in osmotic stress-treated vegetative tissues.
   - Real-time PCR analysis showed that **OsLEA1a** was expressed in roots, leaves and panicles of rice, with no or only a few transcripts in stem tissues, and remained at a relatively higher level in leaves during the tillering period, the heading period, the filling period and the full ripe period.
   - Characterization of **OsLEA1a** and its inhibitory effect on the resistance of E. coli to diverse abiotic stresses.
   - The accumulation of the TrxA-**OsLEA1a** fusion protein or **OsLEA1a** protein interfered with the resistance of E.
   - The findings suggested that the **OsLEA1a** may confor antibacterial activity under abiotic stresses.
   - However, in the present study, based on growth status and physiological indices of rice plant, the overexpression of **OsLEA1a** in rice conferred increased resistance to abiotic stresses compared with the wild-type (WT) plants.
   - Our previous studies have shown that the heterologous expression of **OsLEA1a** interfered with the resistance of Escherichia coli to abiotic stresses.
   - **OsLEA1a** overexpression enhances tolerance to diverse abiotic stresses by inhibiting cell membrane damage and enhancing ROS scavenging capacity in transgenic rice.
   - The present study shows that **OsLEA1a** could be a useful candidate gene for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in cultivated plants.
   - The results indicate that the **OsLEA1a** gene is involved in the protective response of plants to various abiotic stresses by inhibiting cell membrane damage and enhancing reactive oxygen species scavenging capacity.
