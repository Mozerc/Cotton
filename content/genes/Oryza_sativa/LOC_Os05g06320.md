- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - However, the abundance of OS-**ERS2** mRNA was shown to be down-regulated by both IAA and ethylene treatments, indicating that it was not positively regulated by ethylene.
   - Five ethylene receptor genes, OS-ERS1, OS-**ERS2**, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 were isolated and characterized from rice.
   - Deduced amino acid sequences of OS-ERS1, OS-**ERS2**, OS-ETR2, OS-ETR3, and OS-ETR4 showed that they exhibited significant homology to the prokaryotic two-component signal transducer and a wide range of ethylene receptors in a variety of plant species.
   - Analysis of the expression of the three ethylene receptor genes in different tissues of rice has unravelled their corresponding tissue-specificity in which OS-ERS1 was constitutively expressed in considerable amounts in all tissues studied, while OS-**ERS2** and OS-ETR2 exhibited differential expression patterns in different tissues of rice.
