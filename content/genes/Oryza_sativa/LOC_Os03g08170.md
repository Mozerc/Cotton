## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **GUDK** mutants interestingly showed a significant reduction in grain yield, both under normal well-watered conditions and under drought stress at the reproductive stage.
   - Loss-of-function **GUDK** mutant lines exhibit sensitivity to salinity, osmotic stress, and abscisic acid treatment at the seedling stage, and a reduction in photosynthesis and plant biomass under controlled drought stress at the vegetative stage.
   - Phosphoproteome profiling of the mutant followed by in vitro assays identified the transcription factor APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR OsAP37 as a phosphorylation target of **GUDK**.
   - We propose that **GUDK** mediates drought stress signaling through phosphorylation and activation of OsAP37, resulting in transcriptional activation of stress-regulated genes, which impart tolerance and improve yield under drought.
   - Our transactivation assays confirmed that **GUDK** is required for activation of stress genes by OsAP37.
   - **GUDK** is induced under several stresses and its loss-of-function increased the sensitivity of rice seedlings to salinity, osmotic stress, and abscisic acid treatment.
   - In addition to reduced tolerance of **GUDK** mutant plants to drought stress at vegetative stage, a significant reduction in grain yield was observed under well-watered and drought stress conditions at reproductive stage.
   - Thus, our results suggest that **GUDK** has the potential to regulate grain yield both under favorable and unfavorable conditions.
   - Gene co-expression analysis supports the role of **GUDK** in regulating important biological processes both under control and stress conditions.
