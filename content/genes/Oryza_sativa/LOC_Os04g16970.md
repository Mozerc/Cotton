## Functional Descriptions:
   - Heterogeneous overexpression of **OsCTR1** in Arabidopsis exhibited hypersensitive phenotypes with respect to ABA-responsive seed germination, seedling growth and stomatal closure.
   - **OsCTR1** was highly expressed in response to dehydration treatment and defense-related phytohormones, and its encoded protein was localized in both the chloroplasts and the cytosol.
   - Several interacting partners were identified, which were mainly targeted to the chloroplasts, and interactions with **OsCTR1** were confirmed by using biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC).
   - Interestingly, two chloroplast-localized proteins (OsCP12 and OsRP1) interacted with **OsCTR1** in the cytosol, and ubiquitination by **OsCTR1** led to protein degradation via the Ub 26S proteasome.
   - The rice RING E3 ligase, **OsCTR1**, inhibits trafficking to the chloroplasts of OsCP12 and OsRP1, and its overexpression confers drought tolerance in Arabidopsis.
   - Here, we found that a rice gene, **OsCTR1**, encoding the RING Ub E3 ligase plays an important role in drought tolerance.
