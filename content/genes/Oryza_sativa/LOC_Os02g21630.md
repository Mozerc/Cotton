## Functional Descriptions:
   - Together with transcriptome analysis of **OsPITP6** rice plants and phenotypic analysis of grafted Arabidopsis chimeras, these results suggest that chloroplastic Sec14-like proteins play an essential role in growth modulations in response to changes in Pi availability, although their function is critical for plant growth under any Pi condition.
   - The superior traits of **OsPITP6**-overexpressing rice plants also highlight the potential of **OsPITP6** and its homologs in other crops as additional tools for improving Pi uptake and plant growth in low Pi environments.
   - Importantly, overexpression of **OsPITP6** increased tiller number and grain yield in rice.
   - By contrast, overexpression of AtPITP7 and **OsPITP6** enhanced Pi uptake and plant growth, especially under limited Pi supply.
   - Targeted metabolome analysis of glycerolipids in leaves and chloroplasts revealed that inactivation of **OsPITP6** alters phospholipid contents, independent of Pi availability, diminishing the reduction in phospholipid content and increase in glycolipid content induced by Pi deficiency; meanwhile, overexpression of **OsPITP6** enhanced Pi deficiency induced metabolic alterations.
