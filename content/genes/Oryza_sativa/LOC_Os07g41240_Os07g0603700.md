## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **GE** promoted cell proliferation and enhanced rice plant growth and grain yield, but reduced embryo size, sug**GE**sting that **GE** is critical for coordinating rice embryo and endosperm development.
   - The function of **GE** in each tissue is distinct, controlling cell size in the embryo and cell death in the endosperm.
   - Post-embryonic growth of **GE** seedling was severely inhibited due to defective shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance.
   - GE, which encodes **CYP78A13**, is predominantly expressed in the interfacing tissues of the both embryo and endosperm.
   - In contrast to the loss-of-function mutant with lar**GE** embryo and small endosperm, **GE** overexpression causes a small embryo and enlar**GE**d endosperm.
   - A complementation analysis coupled with heterofertilization showed that complementation of **GE** mutation in either embryo or endosperm failed to restore the wild-type embryo/endosperm ratio.
   - Among **GE**nes associated with embryo/endosperm size, REDUCED EMBRYO **GE**nes, whose loss-of-function causes a phenotype opposite to **GE**, are revealed to regulate endosperm size upstream of **GE**.
   - To fully understand the embryo-endosperm size control, the **GE**netic network of the related **GE**nes should be elucidated.
   - However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying embryo and endosperm development remains lar**GE**ly unknown, particularly in rice, the model cereal.
   - **GE** is expressed predominantly in the scutellar epithelium, the interface region between embryo and endosperm.
   - Mutation of **GE** resulted in a lar**GE** embryo in the seed, which was caused by excessive expansion of scutellum cells.
   - Moreover, trans**GE**nic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtCYP78A10, a **GE** homolog, also produced big**GE**r seeds, implying a conserved role for the CYP78A subfamily of P450s in regulating seed development.
   - 2 showed that both can promote grain growth.
   - Variations in **CYP78A13** coding region influence grain size and yield in rice..
   - Grain size is one of the most important determinants of crop yield in cereals.
   - Here, we identified a dominant mutant, big grain2 (bg2-D) from our enhancer-trapping population.
   - Sequence search revealed that **CYP78A13** has a paralogue Grain<U+2005>Length 3.
   - Detailed examination of the transgenic plants with chimaeric constructs suggested that variation in **CYP78A13** coding region is responsible for the variation of grain yield.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that the variations in **CYP78A13** in the indica varieties hold potential in rice breeding for application of grain yield improvement.
