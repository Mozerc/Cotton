## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results indicate that **OsPMT16** contributes significantly to pistil development during reproductive growth.
   - Rice Putative Methyltransferase Gene **OsPMT16** Is Required for Pistil Development Involving Pectin Modification.
   - **OsPMT16** expression was confirmed in the pistil, and effects of pectin methylesterification regulation on the reproductive stage were investigated by studying the phenotype of the T-DNA insertion mutant.
   - The **OsPMT16** mutant showed significantly reduced fertility.
   - Herein, we report the functional characterization of the **OsPMT16** gene, which encodes a putative pectin methyltransferase (PMT) in rice.
