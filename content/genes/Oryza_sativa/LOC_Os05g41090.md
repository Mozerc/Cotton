## Functional Descriptions:
   - Although Oryza sativa CCaMK (**OsCCaMK**) is required for fungal accommodation in rice roots, little is known about the role of **OsCCaMK** in rice symbiosis with bacteria.
   - Thus, CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation were simultaneously activated in the root zone of WT rice in the LN field and both processes are likely controlled by **OsCCaMK**.
   - In the present study, the role of rice CCaMK, **OsDMI3**, in ABA-induced antioxidant defense was investigated in leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) plants.
   - Our data reveal that **OsDMI3** is an important component in ABA-induced antioxidant defense in rice.
   - **OsDMI3** is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice.
   - ABA treatment induced the expression of **OsDMI3** and OsMPK1 and the activities of **OsDMI3** and OsMPK1 in rice leaves.
   - Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between **OsDMI3** and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which **OsDMI3** functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice.
   - Further, the oxidative damage induced by higher concentrations of PEG and H(2)O(2) was aggravated in the mutant of **OsDMI3**.
   - Treatments with ABA, H(2)O(2), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced the expression of **OsDMI3** and the activity of **OsDMI3**, and H(2)O(2) is required for the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of **OsDMI3** under water stress.
   - Here, we report the effect of a Tos17-induced **OsCCaMK** mutant (NE1115) on CH4 flux in low-nitrogen (LN) and standard-nitrogen (SN) paddy fields compared with wild-type (WT) Nipponbare.
   - Moreover, the analysis of the RNAi silencing of **OsDMI3** in protoplasts and the mutant of **OsDMI3** showed that higher levels of H(2)O(2) accumulation require **OsDMI3** activation in ABA signaling, but the initial H(2)O(2) production induced by ABA is not dependent on the activation of **OsDMI3** in leaves of rice plants.
   - This was consistent with the results of Na+ content and NMT that indicated **OsDMI3** promoted root elongation under saline-alkaline stress by reducing root Na+ and H+ influx.
   - Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase **OsDMI3** positively regulates saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots.
   - Collectively, our results suggest that **OsDMI3** could promote saline-alkaline tolerance in rice roots by modulating the Na+ and H+ influx.
   - Moreover, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that **OsDMI3** up-regulated the transcript levels of OsSOS1 and PM-H+-ATPase genes OsA3 and OsA8 in saline-alkaline stressed rice plants.
   - We measured the **OsDMI3** activity by an in-gel kinase assay, Na+ content by NaHCO3 treatment, and Na+ and H+ fluxes by noninvasive micro-test technology (NMT).
   - **OsDMI3** was found to directly phosphorylate Thr-25 in the N-terminus of OsMKK1, and this Thr-25 phosphorylation is **OsDMI3**-specific in ABA signaling.
   - These findings reveal OsUXS3 as a direct target of **OsDMI3** and demonstrate its involvement in antioxidant defense.
   - Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that OsUXS3 acts downstream of **OsDMI3** to enhance the oxidative stress tolerance conferred by higher catalase (CAT) activity.
   - Our results indicate that **OsDMI3** promotes the association of OsUXS3 with OsCATB to enhance CAT activity under oxidative stress.
