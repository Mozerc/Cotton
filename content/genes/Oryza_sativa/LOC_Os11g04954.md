## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsDMC1**-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility.
   - The sterility phenotypes were associated with down-regulated **OsDMC1** transcript and protein levels mediated by RNAi.
   - **OsDMC1** was expressed at high-levels in reproductive organs, low-levels in roots, and undetectable levels in leaves and seedlings.
   - Isolation and characterization of **OsDMC1** , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis.
   - Further cytological observations of male meiocytes revealed that knock-down of **OsDMC1** led to defects in bivalent formation and subsequent unequal chromosome segregation and irregular spore generation, and induced changes in male meiotic progression.
   - DNA binding and pairing activities of Oryza sativa disrupted meiotic cDNA1 (**OsDMC1**) from rice have been reported earlier.
   - A cloned cDNA corresponding to **OsDMC1** from rice anther tissue was expressed in Escherichia coli.
   - Here, we analyzed the function of **OsDMC1** in meiosis using an RNA interference approach.
   - These data indicate that **OsDMC1** is essential for rice meiosis and plays an important role in homologous pairing.
   - These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and **DMC1B** proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice.
   - Moreover, **OsDMC1** was not detected in pairing-defective mutants, such as pair2, pair3, Oscom1 and Osrad51c, while it was loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in zep1, Osmer3, Oszip4 and Oshei10.
   - The reduced number of bivalents and abnormal OsHEI10 foci in Osdmc1a **OsDMC1B** establishes an essential role for OsDMC1 in crossover formation.
   - These results indicate that OsBRCA2 is essential for facilitating the loading of OsRAD51 and **OsDMC1** onto resected ends of programmed double-strand breaks (DSB) during meiosis to promote single-end invasions of homologous chromosomes and accurate recombination.
   - In the absence of OsBRCA2, localization to the meiotic chromosome axes of the strand-invasion proteins OsRAD51 and **OsDMC1** is severely reduced and in vitro OsBRCA2 directly interacts with OsRAD51 and **OsDMC1**.
   - In the homologous recombination pathway, the detailed mechanisms of how OsRAD51 and **OsDMC1** work in rice meiosis remain to be explored.
   - In addition, both OsRAD51 and **OsDMC1** can interact with OsFIGL1 and OsBRCA2, two important components in rice meiosis.
