## Functional Descriptions:
   - The PLATZ transcription factor **GL6** affects grain length and number in rice..
   - The null **GL6** mutant possesses short grains, whereas overexpression of **GL6** results in large grains and decreased grain number per panicle.
   - **GL6** positively controls grain length by promoting cell proliferation in young panicles and grains.
   - We demonstrate that **GL6** participates in RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) transcription machinery by interacting with RPC53 and TFC1 to regulate the expression of genes involved in rice grain development.
   - Here, we functionally characterized the role of **SG6** in determining grain size through the regulation of spikelet hull cell division.
   - The overexpression of **SG6** resulted in significantly larger and heavier grains, as well as increased plant heights, which is consistent with its elevated spikelet hull cell division rate.
   - These results confirm the crucial role of **SG6** in determining grain size by regulating spikelet hull cell division and provide clues for understanding the functions of PLATZ family proteins and the network regulating cereal grain size.
   - Yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that **SG6** interacts with the core cell cycle machinery DP protein and several other putative cell division regulators, consistent with our transcriptomic analysis, which showed that **SG6** activates the expression of many DNA replication and cell-cycle-related genes.
   - **SG6** encodes a previously uncharacterized PLATZ (plant AT-rich sequence and zinc-binding) protein that is ubiquitously localized throughout the cell and is preferentially expressed in the early developing panicles but not in the endosperm.
