## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, a member of the DUF966 gene family, DUF966-stress repressive gene 2 in Oryza sativa (**OsDSR2**, Loc_Os01g62200), was cloned and its role in rice responding to salt and simulated drought stresses was functionally characterized.
   - Expression profile analysis of adversity showed that **OsDSR2** had different transcriptional responses to salt, drought, cold, heat and oxidative (H2O2) stresses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, gibberellin acid and auxin treatments.
   - Overexpression of **OsDSR2** could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C.
   - These results suggested that **OsDSR2** negatively regulated rice response to salt and simulated drought stresses as well as ABA signaling, which provided some useful data for understanding the functional roles of DUF966 family genes in abiotic stress responses in plants.
   - Overexpression of a new stress-repressive gene **OsDSR2** encoding a protein with a DUF966 domain increases salt and simulated drought stress sensitivities and reduces ABA sensitivity in rice.
   - **OsDSR2** was expressed mainly in nodes of stems and leaf blades from rice.
   - Furthermore, **OsDSR2**-overexpressing plants showed reduced ABA sensitivity during the post-germination stage.
