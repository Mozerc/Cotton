- **Gene Symbol:** KRP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed **KRP1** reduced cell production during leaf development.
   - The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;**KRP1** plays an important role in seed development of rice.
   - Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;**KRP1** plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation.
   - However, phyB mutants exhibited reduced total leaf area per plant, which was probably due to a reduction in the total number of cells per leaf caused by enhanced expression of Orysa;**KRP1** and Orysa;KRP4 (encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase complex activity) in the phyB mutants.
   - Sectioning through the overexpressed **KRP1** seeds showed that KRP overproduction disturbed the production of endosperm cells.
   - The decrease in the number of fully formed seeds was accompanied by a drop in the endoreduplication of endosperm cells, pointing toward a role of **KRP1** in connecting endocycle with endosperm development.
   - Furthermore, Orysa;**KRP1** overexpression dramatically reduced seed filling.
