## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g57270](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g57270)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0817800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0817800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** RTBP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **RTBP1** plants displayed progressive and severe developmental abnormalities in both germination and postgermination growth of vegetative organs over four generations (G1 to G4).
   - Furthermore, 35S:anti-**RTBP1** plants expressing lower levels of **RTBP1** mRNA exhibited developmental phenotypes intermediate between the wild type and mutants in all aspects examined, including telomere length, vegetative and reproductive growth, and degree of genomic anomaly.
   - These results suggest that **RTBP1** plays dual roles in rice (Oryza sativa), as both a negative regulator of telomere length and one of positive and functional components for proper architecture of telomeres.
