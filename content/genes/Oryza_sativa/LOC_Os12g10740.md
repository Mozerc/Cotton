## Functional Descriptions:
   - **RIR1** overexpression plants were more susceptible to Xoo at late growth stage, suggesting that **RIR1** mRNA levels are negatively correlated with the resistance of rice against Xoo.
   - Here, we found that a Tos17 insertion mutant of LRR_RLK displayed increasing temporal resistance to Xoo, whereas the LRR_RLK overexpression lines were susceptible to the pathogen early on in the infection, indicating that LRR_RLK encodes a repressor of rice resistance to Xoo infection, and it was renamed as **RIR1** (Rice Immunity Repressor 1).
   - **RIR1** represses plant immunity by interacting with mitochondrial complex I subunit in rice.
   - Notably, impairment of **RIR1** or overexpression of NUO resulted in reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced expression of pathogen-resistance genes, including jasmonic acid pathway genes.
   - Co-immunoprecipitation, bimolecular fluoresence complementation, and pull-down assays indicated that **RIR1** interacted with the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NUO) 51-kDa subunit of the mitochondrial complex I through its kinase domain.
