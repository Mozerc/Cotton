## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os05g32850](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g32850)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0395300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0395300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** DPS1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DPS1** plants were characterized by small whitish anthers with altered cuticle morphology and absence of pollen grains.
   - These results suggest that **DPS1** plays a vital role in regulating ROS homeostasis, anther cuticle formation and panicle development in rice.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **DPS1** encodes a mitochondrial-localized protein containing a cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain which showed the highest expression in panicles and anthers.
   - Panicles of **DPS1** plants showed an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower antioxidant activity and increased programmed cell death.
   - Global gene expression analysis in **DPS1** revealed that biological processes related to fatty acid metabolism and ROS homeostasis were significantly affected and the expression of key genes involved in wax and cutin biosynthesis were downregulated.
   - Amounts of cuticular wax and cutin were significantly reduced in **DPS1** anthers.
