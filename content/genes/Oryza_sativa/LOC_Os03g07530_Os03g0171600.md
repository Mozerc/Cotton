## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we report that **OsFBK12** (an F-box protein containing a Kelch repeat motif) interacts with S-ADENOSYL-l-METHIONINE SYNTHETASE1 (SAMS1) to regulate leaf senescence and seed size as well as grain number in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Phenotypically, overexpression of **OsFBK12** led to a delay in leaf senescence and germination and increased seed size, whereas knockdown lines of either **OsFBK12** or OsSAMS1 promoted the senescence program.
   - Our results suggest that **OsFBK12** is involved in the 26S proteasome pathway by interacting with Oryza sativa S-PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1-LIKE PROTEIN and that it targets the substrate OsSAMS1 for degradation, triggering changes in ethylene levels for the regulation of leaf senescence and grain size.
   - The F-box protein **OsFBK12** targets OsSAMS1 for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice.
   - **OsFBK12**-RNA interference lines and OsSAMS1 overexpression lines showed increased ethylene levels, while **OsFBK12**-OX lines and OsSAMS1-RNA interference plants exhibited decreased ethylene.
