## Functional Descriptions:
   - Results show that **OsRacB** transcription is highly accumulated in roots after treatment with salinity, but only slightly accumulated in stems and leaves under the same treatment.
   - A dramatic down-regulation in the **OsRacB** transcripts was also found in plants inoculated with the blast pathogen, Magnaporthe grisea.
   - Interestingly, transgenic rice plants over-expressing **OsRacB** showed increased symptom development in response to rice blast pathogens.
   - In this study, we focus on the relationship between the novel rice Rop gene **OsRacB** and plant salt tolerance.
   - This suggests that overexpression of **OsRacB** in tobacco and rice can improve plant salt tolerance.
   - The results indicated that **OsRacB** is only an accessory factor in plant salt tolerance.
   - Rice GTPase **OsRacB**: Potential Accessory Factor in Plant Salt-stress Signaling.
   - Promoter analysis showed that **OsRacB** promoter is induced by salinity and exogenous salicylic acid, not abscisic acid.
   - The basal mRNA level of **OsRacB** in LS of two-week-old seedlings was strongly down-regulated upon wounding by cut and treatment with jasmonic acid.
   - To our interest in finding a negative ROP regulator of disease resistance in rice, we applied a phylogeny of function approach to rice Rops, and identified **OsRacB** based on its close genetic orthologous relationship with the barley HvRacB gene, a known negative regulator of disease resistance.
   - Based on these results, we suggest that **OsRacB** functions as a potential regulator for a basal disease resistance pathway in rice.
   - Functional characterization of **OsRacB** GTPase--a potentially negative regulator of basal disease resistance in rice.
   - The knockout mutants were normal in anther and pollen development but defective in the pollen grain germination, suggesting a specific and non-redundant role of **OsRacB** in the mature pollen.
   - A small Rho GTPase **OsRacB** is required for pollen germination in rice..
   - We further demonstrated that **OsRacB** is directly activated by the pollen specific expressing OsRopGEFs in vitro.
