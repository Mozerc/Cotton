## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g32610](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g32610)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0527600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0527600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsCTR2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Yield-related agronomic traits, including flowering time and effective tiller number, were altered in **OsCTR2** and 35S:**OsCTR2** (1-513) transgenic lines.
   - The **OsCTR2** loss-of-function mutation and expression of the 35S:**OsCTR2** (1-513) transgene that encodes the **OsCTR2** N terminus (residues 1-513) revealed several and many aspects, respectively, of ethylene-induced growth alteration in rice.
   - Because the **OsCTR2** allele did not produce all aspects of ethylene-induced growth alteration, the ethylene-receptor signal output might be mediated in part by **OsCTR2** and by other components in rice.
   - Our understanding of roles of ethylene in various aspects of growth and development in japonica rice varieties could be advanced with the use of the **OsCTR2** and 35S:**OsCTR2** (1-513) transgenic lines.
   - Arabidopsis ethylene receptors ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 and ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR1 physically interacted with **OsCTR2** on yeast two-hybrid assay, and green fluorescence protein-tagged **OsCTR2** was localized at the endoplasmic reticulum.
