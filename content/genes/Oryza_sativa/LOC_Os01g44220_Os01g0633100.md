## Functional Descriptions:
   - A floury endosperm mutant, **osagpl2-3**, was isolated from the M2 generation of japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare following ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis.
   - The **osagpl2-3** mutant produced a white-core endosperm compared to the transparent endosperm of the wild type (WT).
   - Phenotypic and Candidate Gene Analysis of a New Floury Endosperm Mutant (**osagpl2-3**) in Rice.
   - The analysis for cooking and nutrition quality traits indicated that the values of gel consistency, gelatinization temperature, and rapid viscosity analysis profile of **osagpl2-3** grains were lower than those of the WT.
   - OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and **OsAPL2** were expressed later in seed development.
   - The results from scanning electron microscope showed that the **osagpl2-3** mutant grains comprised of round and loosely packed starch granules, some of which were compounded.
   - Moreover, the expression of **OsAGPL2** and its counterpart, OsAGPS2b, was highly coordinated in rice endosperm.
   - Yeast two-hybrid and BiFC assays verified direct interactions between **OsAGPL2** and OsAGPS2b as well as OsAGPL1 and OsAGPS1, supporting the model for spatiotemporal complex formation of AGPase isoforms in rice endosperm.
   - Grains of **GIF2** showed a slower filling rate and a significant lower final grain weight and yield compared to wild-type.
   - All these results suggest that **GIF2** plays important roles in the regulation of grain filling and starch biosynthesis during caryopsis development, and that it has been preserved during selection throughout domestication of modern rice.
   - The starch content in **GIF2** was noticeably decreased and its physicochemical properties were also altered.
   - Transcript levels for granule-bound starch synthase, starch synthase, starch branching enzyme and starch debranching enzyme were distinctly elevated in **GIF2** grains.
   - Moreover, **GIF2** endosperm cells showed obvious defects in compound granule formation.
   - Positional cloning identified **GIF2** to encode an ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) large subunit, AGPL2; consequently, AGP enzyme activity in **GIF2** endosperms was remarkably decreased.
   - This reflected the unanticipated expression of both **OsAPL2** and OsAPS2b in the leaves, generating a complete ectopic AGPase in the leaf cytosol, and a corresponding decrease in the expression of the plastidial small subunit OsAPS2a that was only partially complemented by an increase in the expression of OsAPS1.
   - The first committed step in the endosperm starch biosynthetic pathway is catalyzed by the cytosolic glucose-1-phosphate adenylyl transferase (AGPase) comprising large and small subunits encoded by the **OsAPL2** and OsAPS2b genes, respectively.
   - **OsAPL2** is expressed solely in the endosperm so we hypothesized that mutating this gene would block starch biosynthesis in the endosperm without affecting the leaves.
   - OsMADS14 and NF-YB1 cooperate in the direct activation of **OsAGPL2** and Waxy during starch synthesis in rice endosperm..
   - Transcriptomic profiling analyses revealed that the loss-of-function of OsMADS14 leads to significantly downregulated expression of many core starch synthesis genes, including **OsAGPL2** and Waxy.
