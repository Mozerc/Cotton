- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CycB1</u>&nbsp;<u>1</u>&nbsp;<u>OsCycB1</u>&nbsp;<u>1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, resistance to cold stress in the transgenic plants overexpressing **OsCycB1;1** was also enhanced.
   - We show that OsMYB3R-2 specifically bound to a mitosis-specific activator cis-element, (T/C)C(T/C)AACGG(T/C)(T/C)A, a conserved sequence that was found in promoters of cyclin genes such as **OsCycB1;1** and OsKNOLLE2.
   - These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets **OsCycB1;1** and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress.
   - Expression analysis showed that Orysa;**CycB1;1** transcripts were localized in the endosperm and embryo.
   - The results of the knockdown of Orysa;**CycB1;1** via an endosperm or an embryo-specific promoter also suggest that the enlarged embryo may be correlated to the abortive endosperm.
   - Our results suggest that Orysa;**CycB1;1** expression is critical for endosperm formation via the regulation of mitotic division, and that the endosperm plays an important role in maintenance of embryo development in rice.
   - The expression of Orysa;**CycB1;1** is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice.
   - In our current study, we show that the knockdown of Orysa;**CycB1;1** in rice results in the production of abnormal seeds, which at maturity contain only an enlarged embryo.
