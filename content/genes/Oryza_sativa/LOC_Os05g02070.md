- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In contrast with wild-type plants, **OsMT2b**-RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants had serious handicap in plant growth and root formation, whereas **OsMT2b**-overexpressing transformants were dwarfed and presented more adventitious roots and big lateral roots.
   - Taken together, these results indicate a possible feedback regulation mechanism of **OsMT2b** to the level of endogenous cytokinins that is involved in root development and seed embryo germination of rice.
   - Characteristic and expression analysis of a metallothionein gene, **OsMT2b**, down-regulated by cytokinin suggests functions in root development and seed embryo germination of rice.
   - Transgenic plants overexpressing **OsMT2b** showed increased susceptibility to bacterial blight and blast fungus.
   - Histochemical staining analysis of transgenic rice carrying **OsMT2b**::GUS chimeric gene showed that high-level GUS activity was detected in germinated embryos and at the meristematic part of other tissues during germination.
   - **OsMT2b** was preferentially expressed in rice immature panicles, scutellum of germinating embryos, and primordium of lateral roots.
   - A rice subfamily p2 (type 2) MT gene, **OsMT2b**, has been shown previously to exhibit the most abundant gene expression in young rice seedling.
   - We found that the **OsMT2b** gene is strongly and differentially expressed in germinated rice embryos during seed germination and seedling development.
   - We found that the expression of a metallothionein gene (**OsMT2b**) was synergically down-regulated by OsRac1 and rice (Oryza sativa) blast-derived elicitors.
   - Here, we characterized rice (Oryza sativa) METALLOTHIONEIN2b (**OsMT2b**) molecularly and found that its expression was down-regulated by cytokinins.
   - Expression of **OsMT2b** was found to be regulated negatively by ethylene and hydrogen peroxide in rice stem node under flooding stress, but little is known about its response to sugar depletion.
   - Identification of sugar response complex in the metallothionein **OsMT2b** gene promoter for enhancement of foreign protein production in transgenic rice.
   - A 146-bp sugar response complex MTSRC is identified in the promoter of rice metallothionein **OsMT2b** gene conferring high-level expression of luciferase reporter gene and bioactive recombinant haFGF in transgenic rice.
   - We found that the expression of **OsMT2b** gene is induced by sugar starvation in both rice suspension cells and germinated embryos.
   - Deletion analysis and functional assay of the **OsMT2b** promoter revealed that the 5'-flanking region of the **OsMT2b** between nucleotides -<U+2009>351 and -<U+2009>121, which contains the sugar response complex (-<U+2009>266 to -<U+2009>121, designated MTSRC) is responsible for high-level promoter activity under sugar starvation.
