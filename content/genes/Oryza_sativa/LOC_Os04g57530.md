## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we show that the seed shattering is controlled by a single dominant gene, Shattering1 (**SHA1**), encoding a member of the trihelix family of plant-specific transcription factors.
   - Our results demonstrate that the g237t mutation in **SHA1** accounts for the elimination of seed shattering, and that all the domesticated rice cultivars harbor the mutant **SHA1** gene and therefore have lost the ability to shed their seeds at maturity.
   - Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor **sh4**.
   - The **sh4** phylogeny together with the neutrality tests and coalescent simulations suggested that **sh4** had a single origin and was fixed by artificial selection during the domestication of rice.
   - **sh4** (for grain shattering quantitative trait locus on chromosome 4) and qSH1 (for quantitative trait locus of seed shattering on chromosome 1) genes have been identified as required for reduced seed shattering during rice (Oryza sativa) domestication.
   - We also identified a frameshift mutant of **sh4** that completely eliminated AZs and showed nonshattering.
   - Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, **sh4** and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp.
   - The nonshattering **sh4** allele was fixed in all rice cultivars, with levels of sequence polymorphism significantly reduced in both indica and japonica cultivars relative to the wild progenitors.
   - The slow fixation of the nonshattering phenotype observed at the archeological sites might be a result of relatively weak selection on mutations other than **sh4** in early rice cultivation.
   - We assessed allelic identity and diversity at the major shattering locus, **sh4**, in weedy rice; we find that all cultivated and weedy rice, regardless of population, share similar haplotypes at **sh4**, and all contain a single derived mutation associated with decreased seed shattering.
   - Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and **sh4** in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification.
   - The combination of a shared cultivar **sh4** allele and a highly shattering phenotype, suggests that U.
   - Our findings suggest that **sh4** may have additional functions in the growth and development of rice, apart from its major role in seed shattering.
   - Rice seed shattering is an important domestication syndrome encoded by a gene named as **sh4**.
   - Interestingly, GL4 also controls the seed shattering phenotype like its orthologue **sh4** gene in Asian rice.
   - Comparative analysis at **sh4** showed that all the accessions containing ancestral haplotype, including 78 wild relatives of rice and 8 African cultivated rice, had the shattering phenotype, whereas all the accessions with either of the homozygous domestic haplotypes at one of the two sites, including 17 wild relatives of rice, 111 African cultivated rice and 65 Asian cultivated rice, showed the non-shattering phenotype.
   - MutMap cloning revealed that **SG5** encodes a Myb-like transcription factor.
   - Histochemical observation and gene expression analysis indicated that **SG5** regulates spikelet hull development by mediating cell expansion.
   - The effect of pyramiding **SG5** and GS3 suggests that **SG5** and GS3 regulate grain length independently.
   - The results of our study show that the missense mutation in **SG5** is essential for the molecular function of **SG5** and **SG5** is involved in regulating cell expansion and expression of grain-shape-related genes to regulate grain length.
   - In addition, the **SG5** protein is found in the nucleus and does not affect subcellular localization.
   - **SG5** is mainly expressed in young panicles and hulls.
