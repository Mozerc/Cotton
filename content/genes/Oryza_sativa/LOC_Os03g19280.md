## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we further characterized **OsASL1** in terms of expression pattern, subcellular localization, and arginine effect on the root growth.
   - Our results indicate that the subcellular localization was determined by the N terminus of **OsASL1** and that appropriate concentration of Arg is required for normal root elongation in rice.
   - 1 was expressed in most organs throughout the whole growth period, whereas **OsASL1**.
   - Our results indicate that the subcellular localization was determined by the N terminus of **OsASL1** and that appropriate concentration of Arg is required for normal root elongation in rice.
