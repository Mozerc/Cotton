## Functional Descriptions:
   - The accumulation of **OsMGD** mRNA in both FR13A and IR42 was also increased by ethephon, gibberellin, drought and salt treatment, but cold stress had no effect on the expression of the gene.
   - Furthermore, the enhanced expression of **OsMGD** may relate to photosynthesis, and play an important role during submergence.
   - Time-course studies showed that the expression of **OsMGD** in the rice cultivars FR13A and IR42 (submergence-susceptive cultivar) during submergence was gradually increased and that expression in FR13A was higher than in IR42.
   - These results suggest that the expression of **OsMGD** mRNA requires benzyladenine or illumination, and that the process is also mediated by ethephon and gibberellin.
   - The leaf of **OsMGD2** mutants showed reduced MGDG (âˆ¼11.
   - Put together, the present study demonstrated that **OsMGD2** is the predominantly expressed gene encoding MGDG synthase in anther and grain and plays important roles in plant growth and development, as well as in grain quality.
   - Although subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that **OsMGD2** is localized to chloroplast, its expression was observed mainly in anther and endosperm, suggesting that MGDG might have an important role in the development of flower and grain in rice.
   - Knock-out mutants of **OsMGD2** were generated employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system and their morphology, yield and grain quality related traits were studied.
