## Functional Descriptions:
   - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the ABA-related genes were involved in the **OsHIPL1** regulation of seed vigour in rice.
   - These results indicate that the regulation of seed vigour of **OsHIPL1** may be through modulating endogenous ABA levels and altering OsABIs expression during seed germination in rice.
   - Meanwhile, we found that **OsHIPL1** interacted with the aquaporin OsPIP1;1, then affected water uptake to promote rice seed germination.
   - Based on analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism data of rice accessions, we identified a Hap1 haplotype of **OsHIPL1** that was positively correlated with seed germination.
   - Our findings showed novel insights into the molecular mechanism of **OsHIPL1** on seed vigour.
   - The higher levels of endogenous ABA were measured in germinating seeds of **OsHIPL1** mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants, with two up-regulated ABA biosynthesis genes (OsZEP and OsNCED4) and one down-regulated ABA catabolism gene OsABA8ox3.
   - **OsHIPL1** was mainly localized in the plasma membrane and nucleus.
   - The expression of abscisic acid-insensitive 3 (OsABI3), OsABI4 and OsABI5 was significantly up-regulated in germinating seeds of **OsHIPL1** mutants and NIL-qsv3 line compared to IR26 plants.
   - **OsHIPL1**, a hedgehog-interacting protein-like 1 protein, increases seed vigour in rice.
