## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of Ospho1;1 and **OsPHO1;2** insertion mutants revealed that only **OsPHO1;2** mutants had defects in Pi homeostasis, namely strong reduction in Pi transfer from root to shoot, which was accompanied by low-shoot and high-root Pi.
   - Our data identify **OsPHO1;2** as playing a key role in the transfer of Pi from roots to shoots in rice, and indicate that this gene could be regulated by its cis-natural antisense transcripts.
   - Characterization of the rice PHO1 gene family reveals a key role for **OsPHO1;2** in phosphate homeostasis and the evolution of a distinct clade in dicotyledons.
   - However, while the **OsPHO1;2** sense transcript was relatively stable under various nutrient deficiencies, the antisense transcript was highly induced by inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency.
   - The most abundantly expressed gene was **OsPHO1;2** in the roots, for both sense and antisense transcripts.
   - OsPHO1;1 was mainly localized at the phloem region of diffuse vascular bundles of node I, while **OsPHO1;2** was expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells of the enlarged vascular bundles.
   - Taken together, **OsPHO1;2** expressed in node I is responsible for unloading of P from the xylem of enlarged vascular bundles, while OsPHO1;1 is involved in reloading P into phloem of diffuse vascular bundles for subsequent allocation of P to the seeds.
   - At the reproductive stage, both OsPHO1;1 and **OsPHO1;2** showed higher expression in the node I, the uppermost node connecting to panicle.
   - Furthermore, OsPHO1;1 and **OsPHO1;2** expressed in the caryopsis are important for delivering of P from the maternal tissues to the filial tissues for seed development.
   - Knockout of **OsPHO1;2** as well as OsPHO1;1 with less extent decreased the distribution of P to the seed, resulting in decreased seed size and delayed germination.
   - Both OsPHO1;1 and **OsPHO1;2** were localized to the plasma membrane and showed influx transport activities for inorganic phosphate.
