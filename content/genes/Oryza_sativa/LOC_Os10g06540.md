- **Gene Symbol:** OsVAMP714
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, we showed that **OsVAMP714** overexpression promotes leaf sheath elongation and that the first 19 amino acids, which are highly conserved between animal and plant VAMP7 proteins, are crucial for normal rice plant growths.
   - Disease resistance tests using **OsVAMP714** knockdown and overexpressing rice plants demonstrated the involvement of **OsVAMP714** in blast resistance.
   - The overexpression of OsVAMP7111, whose product is highly homologous to **OsVAMP714**, did not enhance blast resistance to rice, implying a potential specificity of **OsVAMP714** to blast resistance.
   - We showed that chloroplast localization is critical for the normal **OsVAMP714** functioning in blast resistance by analyzing the rice plants overexpressing **OsVAMP714** mutants whose products did not localize in the chloroplast.
   - **OsVAMP714** was localized to the chloroplast in mesophyll cells and to the cellular periphery in epidermal cells of transgenic rice plant leaves.
