## Functional Descriptions:
   - UV-B radiation damages nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA by the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (**CPD**s), which are the primary UV-B-induced DNA lesions, and are a principal cause of UV-B-induced growth inhibition in plants.
   - We previously indicated that UV-resistant rice cultivars are better able to repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (**CPD**s) through photorepair than are UV-sensitive cultivars.
   - Surjamkhi (indica) exhibited greater sensitivity to UVB radiation and was more deficient in **CPD** photorepair ability compared with UV-resistant Sasanishiki (japonica).
   - In order to verify that suggestion, we examined the correlation between UVB sensitivity and **CPD** photolyase activity in 17 rice cultivars of progenitors and relatives in breeding of UV-resistant Sasanishiki and UV-sensitive Norin 1.
   - To date, the **CPD** repair processes in plant chloroplasts and mitochondria remain poorly understood.
   - Here, we report the photoreactivation of **CPD**s in chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA in rice.
   - Biochemical and subcellular localization analyses using rice strains with different levels of **CPD** photolyase activity and transgenic rice strains showed that full-length **CPD** photolyase is encoded by a single gene, not a splice variant, and is expressed and targeted not only to nuclei but also to chloroplasts and mitochondria.
   - The results indicate that rice may have evolved a **CPD** photolyase that functions in chloroplasts, mitochondria and nuclei, and that contains DNA to protect cells from the harmful effects of UV-B radiation.
   - Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (**CPD**) photolyase repairs ultraviolet-B-induced **CPD**s in rice chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA.
   - 7-fold higher **CPD** photolyase activities than the wild-type, respectively, were significantly more resistant to UVB-induced growth damage, and maintained significantly lower **CPD** levels in their leaves during growth under elevated UVB radiation.
   - Conversely, the AS-D plant had little photolyase activity, was severely damaged by elevated UVB radiation, and maintained higher **CPD** levels in its leaves during growth under UVB radiation.
   - Notably, the S-C plant was not more resistant to UVB-induced growth inhibition than the S-B plant, even though it had much higher **CPD** photolyase activity.
   - These results strongly indicate that UVB-induced **CPD**s are one of principal causes of UVB-induced growth inhibition in rice plants grown under supplementary UVB radiation, and that increasing **CPD** photolyase activity can significantly alleviate UVB-caused growth inhibition in rice.
   - Increase in **CPD** photolyase activity functions effectively to prevent growth inhibition caused by UVB radiation.
   - These results suggest that spontaneously occurring mutations in the **CPD** photolyase gene cause different degrees of sensitivity to UVB in rice, and that the resistance of rice to UVB radiation could be increased by increasing the photolyase function through conventional breeding or bioengineering.
   - Plants homozygous for the Nipponbare allele at the **qUVR-10** locus were more resistant to UVB compared with the Kasalath allele.
   - Here, we tested whether **CPD** photolyase function determines the UVB sensitivity of rice (Oryza sativa) by generating transgenic rice plants bearing the **CPD** photolyase gene of the UV-resistant rice cultivar Sasanishiki in the sense orientation (S-B and S-C lines) or the antisense orientation (AS-D line).
