## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g04740](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g04740)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0140300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0140300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsCNX6</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Genetic complementation indicated that **OsCNX6** not only rescued the PHS and seedling lethal phenotype of cnx6 mutant, but also recovered the MoCo-dependent enzyme activities such as xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), aldehyde oxidase (AO), nitrate reductase (NR), and sulfite oxidase (SO).
   - Expression pattern showed that **OsCNX6** was richly expressed in seed during embryo maturation by qRT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization.
   - Collectively, these data described that **OsCNX6** participated in MoCo biosynthesis, and is essential for rice development, especially for seed dormancy and germination, and **OsCNX6** could be an effective target for improving abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
   - Map-based cloning showed that **OsCNX6** and OsCNX1 encoding homologs of MoaE and MoeA were responsible for F254 and F5-1 mutants, respectively.
   - Furthermore, the **OsCNX6** overexpression plants can significantly enhance the MoCo-dependent enzyme activities, and improved the osmotic and salt stress tolerance without unfavorable phenotypes.
