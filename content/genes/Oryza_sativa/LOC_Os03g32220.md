## Functional Descriptions:
   - Moreover overexpression of **OsDRZ1** did not lead to growth inhibition but the promotion of rice growth, implying the potential application prospective of **OsDRZ1** in engineering drought tolerant crops.
   - Overexpression of **OsDRZ1** in rice increased seedling drought tolerance and the transgenic plants appeared to accumulate more free proline and less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and elevate the activities of antioxidant enzymes.
   - In contrast, RNA interference (RNAi) of **OsDRZ1** led to lower activities of antioxidative response and more sensitivity to drought.
   - RNA-seq analysis revealed that the genes down-regulated by **OsDRZ1** were mostly down-regulated by drought, implying the critical role of **OsDRZ1** in modulating drought responsive gene expression.
   - **OsDRZ1** was expressed throughout all tissues examined and could be induced by multiple abiotic stresses.
   - **OsDRZ1** protein was localized mostly in nucleus.
   - Unlike most reported rice ZFPs functioning as transcriptional activators, **OsDRZ1** is a transcriptional repressor.
