## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os06g50920](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g50920)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0724900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0724900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** ILA1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The increased leaf angle in **ILA1** is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants.
   - **ILA1** is predominantly resident in the nucleus and expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf lamina joints.
   - We report here the characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, increased leaf angle1 (**ILA1**), resulting from a T-DNA insertion in a Group C MAPKKK gene.
   - Microarray analyses of leaf lamina joints provided additional evidence for alterations in mechanical strength in **ILA1**.
   - **ILA1** is thus a key factor regulating mechanical tissue formation at the leaf lamina joint.
