## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g10490](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g10490)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0201600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0201600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsGAE1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In situ hybridization and **OsGAE1** promoter analysis revealed that **OsGAE1** expressed in shoot apex meristem and young primary leaves.
   - **OsGAE1** expressed mainly in growing leaf sheath and callus compared to leaf and root.
   - Transgenic rice expressing **OsGAE1** in antisense orientation exhibited severely affected vegetative and reproductive growth.
   - The rice **OsGAE1** is a novel gibberellin-regulated gene and involved in rice growth.
   - These results suggest that **OsGAE1** is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to GA(3) and it encodes a functional protein which is involved in GA-regulated growth and development of rice.
   - Anti-**OsGAE1** antibodies immunoreacted with a protein of 40 kDa in rice leaf sheath.
