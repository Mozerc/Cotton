## Functional Descriptions:
   - These data demonstrate that nonadditive gene expression was involved in flowering time control in the hybrid rice and that **OsHDT1** level was important for nonadditive or differential expression of many genes including the flowering time genes, suggesting that **OsHDT1** may be involved in epigenetic control of parental genome interaction for differential gene expression.
   - By contrast, silencing of **HDT701** in transgenic rice causes elevated levels of histone H4 acetylation and elevated transcription of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and defense-related genes, increased generation of reactive oxygen species after pathogen-associated molecular pattern elicitor treatment, as well as enhanced resistance to both M.
   - We also found that **HDT701** can bind to defense-related genes to regulate their expression.
   - Taken together, these results demonstrate that **HDT701** negatively regulates innate immunity by modulating the levels of histone H4 acetylation of PRR and defense-related genes in rice.
   - **HDT701**, a histone H4 deacetylase, negatively regulates plant innate immunity by modulating histone H4 acetylation of defense-related genes in rice.
   - Increased **OsHDT1** expression did not affect plant growth in the parent but led to early flowering in the hybrid.
   - Over-expression of **OsHDT1** repressed the nonadditive expression of the key flowering repressors in the hybrid (i.
   - Transcription of **HDT701** is increased in the compatible reaction and decreased in the incompatible reaction after infection by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - Overexpression of **HDT701** in rice decreases ABA, salt and osmotic stress resistance during seed germination.
   - Delayed seed germination of **HDT701** overexpression lines is associated with decreased histone H4 acetylation and down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes.
   - Taken together, our findings suggested that **HDT701** may play an important role in regulating seed germination in response to abiotic stresses in rice.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **HDT701** in rice enhances salt and osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage.
   - **HDT701** is localized at the subcellular level in the nucleus.
   - Expression levels of florigens Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and Rice Flowering Locus<U+00A0>T1 (RFT1), and their immediate upstream floral activator Early<U+00A0>heading date 1 (Ehd1), were significantly decreased in the<U+00A0>**HDT701** mutants, indicating that **HDT701** functions upstream of Ehd1 in controlling flowering time.
