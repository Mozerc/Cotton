## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two allelic **DSM1** mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages.
   - Peroxidase activity, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll content, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine staining revealed that the **DSM1** mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress due to an increase in ROS damage caused by the reduced POX activity.
   - Overexpression of **DSM1** in rice increased the tolerance to dehydration stress at the seedling stage.
   - A Raf-like MAPKKK gene **DSM1** mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice.
   - By real-time PCR analysis, the **DSM1** gene was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid, but not by cold.
   - We identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant (drought-hypersensitive mutant1 [**DSM1**]) of a putative MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) gene in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - The **DSM1** mutants lost water more rapidly than wild-type plants under drought stress, which was in agreement with the increased drought-sensitivity phenotype of the mutant plants.
   - **DSM1**-RNA interference lines were also hypersensitive to drought stress.
   - Together, these results suggest that **DSM1** might be a novel MAPKKK functioning as an early signaling component in regulating responses to drought stress by regulating scavenging of ROS in rice.
