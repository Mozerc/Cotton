## Functional Descriptions:
   - ONAC122 and **ONAC131** expression was induced after infection by Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of rice blast disease, and the M.
   - Functions of rice NAC transcriptional factors, ONAC122 and **ONAC131**, in defense responses against Magnaporthe grisea.
   - Our results suggest that both ONAC122 and **ONAC131** have important roles in rice disease resistance responses through the regulated expression of other defense- and signaling-related genes.
   - ONAC122 and **ONAC131** were also induced by treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (a precursor of ethylene).
   - Here, we characterized two rice pathogen-responsive NAC transcription factors, ONAC122 and **ONAC131**.
