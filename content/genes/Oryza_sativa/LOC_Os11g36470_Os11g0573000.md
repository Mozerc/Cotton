## Functional Descriptions:
   - Further, knocking the expression of **OsUBP21** or AtUBP13 down or out increased the tolerance of rice and Arabidopsis plants to HS stress, suggesting that the function of these ubiquitin-specific proteases in regulating plant HS responses is conserved between monocots and dicots.
