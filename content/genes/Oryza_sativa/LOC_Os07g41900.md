- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsLFR** is essential for early endosperm and embryo development by interacting with SWI/SNF complex members in Oryza sativa.
   - **OsLFR** depletion resulted in homozygous lethality in the early seed stage through endosperm and embryo defects, which could be successfully recovered by the **OsLFR** genomic sequence.
   - Transcriptome profiling showed that many genes, involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, cell wall assembly and cell death, were differentially expressed in a knockout mutant of **OsLFR** (**OsLFR**-1), which was consistent with the observed seed defects.
   - Cytological observations revealed that the **OsLFR** endosperm had relatively fewer free nuclei, had abnormal and arrested cellularization, and demonstrated premature programed cell death: the embryo was reduced in size and failed to differentiate.
   - **OsLFR** was expressed primarily in the rice spikelets and seeds, and the **OsLFR** protein was localized to the nucleus.
