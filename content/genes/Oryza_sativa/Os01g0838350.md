## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0838350](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0838350)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsPI1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A novel gene was isolated by cDNA microarray analysis and designated as **OsPI1** (Oryza sativaPhosphate-limitation Inducible Gene 1).
   - The **OsPI1** gene was rapidly induced by phosphate starvation in both shoots and roots.
   - When phosphate was supplied to phosphate-deficient plants, the **OsPI1** transcripts rapidly disappeared.
   - The **OsPI1** gene shows the same characteristics as the TPSI1/Mt4 family (the phosphate starvation inducible novel gene family).
   - It is suggested that **OsPI1** acts as riboregulator, that is, it binds with other molecules under phosphate starvation and regulates their function.
   - Expression of the **OsPI1** gene, cloned from rice roots using cDNA microarray, rapidly responds to phosphorus status.
