## Functional Descriptions:
   - In these types of cells, mutations in **BC1** cause not only a reduction in cell wall thickness and cellulose content but also an increase in lignin level, suggesting that **BC1**, a gene that controls the mechanical strength of monocots, plays an important role in the biosynthesis of the cell walls of mechanical tissues.
   - This expression pattern was highly similar to that of **BC1**, which encodes a COBRA-like protein involved in cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls in rice.
   - Genetic analysis showed that cwa1 is allelic to brittle culm1 (**BC1**), which encodes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored COBRA-like protein specifically in plants.
   - **BC1** is known as a regulator that controls the culm mechanical strength and cellulose content in the secondary cell walls of sclerenchyma, but the precise function of **BC1** has not been resolved.
   - **BC1**, which encodes a COBRA-like protein, is expressed mainly in developing sclerenchyma cells and in vascular bundles of rice.
   - Our results suggest that CWA1/**BC1** has an essential role in assembling cell wall constituents at their appropriate sites, thereby enabling synthesis of solid and flexible internodes in rice.
   - Isolation of a novel cell wall architecture mutant of rice with defective Arabidopsis COBL4 ortholog **BC1** required for regulated deposition of secondary cell wall components.
   - To understand the molecular mechanism that controls the plant mechanical strength of crops, we characterized the classic rice mutant brittle culm1 (**BC1**) and isolated **BC1** using a map-based cloning approach.
   - Our results suggested that CWA1/**BC1** plays a role in assembling secondary cell wall materials at appropriate sites, enabling synthesis of highly ordered secondary cell wall structure with solid and flexible internodes in rice.
   - To investigate the importance of the CBM-like sequence of CWA1/**BC1** in the assembly of secondary cell wall materials, Trp residues in the CBM-like sequence, which is important for carbohydrate binding, were substituted for Val residues and introduced into the cwa1 mutant.
   - CWA1/**BC1** with the mutated sequence did not complement the abnormal secondary cell walls seen in the cwa1 mutant, indicating that the CBM-like sequence is essential for the proper function of CWA1/**BC1**, including assembly of secondary cell wall materials.
   - The carbohydrate-binding module (CBM)-like sequence is crucial for rice CWA1/**BC1** function in proper assembly of secondary cell wall materials.
