## Functional Descriptions:
   - We had previously reported upregulation of the **OsACDR1** transcript by a range of environmental stimuli involved in eliciting defense-related pathways.
   - Rice plants overexpressing **OsACDR1** exhibited spontaneous hypersensitive response (HR)-like lesions on leaves, upregulation of defense-related marker genes and accumulation of phenolic compounds and secondary metabolites (phytoalexins).
   - In contrast, loss-offunction and RNA silenced **OsACDR1** rice mutant plants showed downregulation of defense-related marker genes expressions and susceptibility to M.
   - These results indicate that **OsACDR1** plays an important role in the positive regulation of disease resistance in rice.
   - Rice **OsACDR1** (Oryza sativa accelerated cell death and resistance 1) is a potential positive regulator of fungal disease resistance.
   - Using our established two-week-old rice seedling in vitro model system, we show that **OsEDR1** has a constitutive expression in seedling leaves and is further up-regulated within 15 min upon wounding by cut, treatment with the global signals jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ethephon, ET), abscisic acid, and hydrogen peroxide.
   - ACC treatment was associated with decreased SA and JA biosynthesis in **OsEDR1**-KO plants.
   - In contrast, aminoethoxyvinylglycine, the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis, promoted expression of SA and JA synthesis-related genes in **OsEDR1**-KO plants.
   - Rice Oryza sativa accelerated cell death and resistance 1 (**OsACDR1**) encodes a putative Raf-like mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK).
   - Finally, **OsEDR1** expression varied significantly in vegetative and reproductive tissues.
   - **OsEDR1**-KO plants also showed suppressed production of ethylene.
   - Knockout of **OsEDR1** suppressed the ACC synthase (ACS) gene family, which encodes the rate-limiting enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis by catalysing the formation of ACC.
   - In the rice-Xoo interaction, **OsEDR1** transcriptionally promotes the synthesis of ethylene that, in turn, suppresses SA- and JA-associated defence signalling.
   - **OsEDR1** negatively regulates rice bacterial resistance via activation of ethylene biosynthesis.
   - Furthermore, using an in vivo system we also show that **OsEDR1** responds to changes in temperature and environmental pollutants-ozone and sulfur dioxide.
   - These results suggest a role for **OsEDR1** in defense/stress signalling pathways and development.
   - The **SPL3** mutant was found to be insensitive to abscisic acid (ABA), showing normal root growth in ABA-containing media and delayed leaf yellowing during dark-induced and natural senescence.
   - By contrast, in **SPL3** mutants grown under continuous light, severe cell death lesions formed in developing leaves, even at the seedling stage.
   - By map-based cloning and complementation, it was shown that a 1-bp deletion in the first exon of Oryza sativa Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase1 (**OsMAPKKK1**)/OsEDR1/OsACDR1 causes the spl3 mutant phenotype.
   - Mutation of SPOTTED LEAF3 (**SPL3**) impairs abscisic acid-responsive signalling and  delays leaf senescence in rice.
   - Furthermore, the **SPL3** mutant had lower transcript levels and activities of catalases, which scavenge hydrogen peroxide, probably due to impairment of ABA-responsive signalling.
   - Finally, a possible molecular mechanism of lesion formation in the mature leaves of **SPL3** mutant is discussed.
   - Here, two newly identified alleles of **OsEDR1** will be benefit for further understanding the molecular mechanisms of the **OsEDR1** gene in disease resistance, and will be helpful for enriching the rice germplasm resources.
   - Pathogen-inducible OsMPKK10.2-OsMPK6 cascade phosphorylates the Raf-like kinase **OsEDR1** and inhibits its scaffold function to promote rice disease resistance.
