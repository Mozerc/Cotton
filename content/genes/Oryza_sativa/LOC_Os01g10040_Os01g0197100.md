## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our chemical analysis suggested that **CYP90D2**/D2 might catalyze C-3 dehydrogenation step in BR biosynthesis.
   - The accumulation profile of BR intermediates in the **D2** mutants confirmed that these plants are deficient in late BR biosynthesis.
   - The **D2** gene encoded a novel cytochrome P450 classified in CYP90D that is highly similar to the reported BR synthesis enzymes.
   - Based on these results, we conclude that D2/**CYP90D2** catalyzes the steps from 6-deoxoteasterone to 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone and from teasterone to 3-dehydroteasterone in the late BR biosynthesis pathway.
   - Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes **D2**, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback.
   - Allelic mutations of **CYP90D2**/D2 confer varying degrees of dwarfism and leaf angle, thus providing useful information for molecular breeding in grain crop plants.
   - In feeding experiments, 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone, 3-dehydroteasterone, and brassinolide effectively caused the lamina joints of the **D2** plants to bend, whereas more upstream compounds did not cause bending.
   - However, in vitro biochemical assays using baculovirus/insect cell-produced proteins revealed that both **CYP90D2** and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of various 22-hydroxylated brassinosteroids, but with markedly different catalytic efficiencies.
   - We showed that the severe dwarf phenotype was caused by a complete deletion of a cytochrome P450 gene, **CYP90D2**/D2, which was further confirmed in two independent T-DNA insertion lines in different genetic backgrounds and by RNA interference.
   - A comprehensive genetic study reveals a crucial role of **CYP90D2**/D2 in regulating plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - A rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, ebisu dwarf (**D2**), is caused by a loss of function of a new member of cytochrome P450.
   - A rice dwarf mutant, ebisu dwarf (d2), which contains a defective copy of **CYP90D2**, is known to be a brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, and **CYP90D2** has been considered to act as a C-3 dehydrogenase.
   - We characterized a rice dwarf mutant, ebisu dwarf (**D2**).
   - The dwarf phenotype of **D2** was rescued by exogenous brassinolide treatment.
   - We report the biochemical characterization of two brassinosteroid-biosynthetic P450s from rice: **CYP90D2** and CYP90D3.
   - These results indicate that **CYP90D2** and CYP90D3 can act as brassinosteroid C-23 hydroxylases in rice.
   - Rice **CYP90D2** and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro.
   - **SMG11** controls grain size by promoting cell expansion in grain hulls.
   - **SMG11** regulates cell expansion, at least in part, by influencing expression of several grain size genes involved in the regulation of cell expansion.
   - The suitable expression of **SMG11** increases grain size, grain weight and grain yield.
   - Cloning and sequence analyses of the SMG11 gene reveal that smg11 is a new allele of DWARF2 (D2), which encodes a cytochrome P450 (**CYP90D2**) involved in brassinosteroid biosynthetic pathway.
   - These results suggest that **OsD2** is associated with the regulation of LTG and improving grain size.
   - Brassinosteroid biosynthesis gene **OsD2** is associated with low-temperature germinability in rice..
   - Thus, **OsD2** may be a suitable target for rice breeding programs to improve rice yield and LTG.
   - Brassinosteroid biosynthesis gene **OsD2** is associated with low-temperature germinability in rice.
