## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic rice expressing **OsTUB8** in an antisense orientation were suppressed in the amount of seed set upon maturity.
   - These results suggest that **OsTUB8** might be differentially expressed in rice anthers due to the action of GA, and involved in the processes of vegetative growth and seed set in rice.
   - **OsTUB8** that was expressed in rice anthers was characterized with a multi-level approach.
   - At the protein level, **OsTUB8** was expressed mainly in anthers compared to callus, root, leaf sheath and leaf blade.
   - In situ hybridization and GUS fusion analysis revealed that **OsTUB8** was expressed in vascular bundles of anther filaments and in pollen.
   - **OsTUB8** expression was lower in the anthers of GA-deficient mutants, ‘Tanginbozu and ‘Akibrarewaisei, compared to those of their respective wild types.
   - Functional analysis of **OsTUB8**, an anther-specific β-tubulin in rice.
