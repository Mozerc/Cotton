## Functional Descriptions:
   - We propose that **OsGL1-6** is involved in the accumulation of leaf cuticular wax and directly impacts drought resistance in rice.
   - Rice **OsGL1-6** Is Involved in Leaf Cuticular Wax Accumulation and Drought Resistance.
   - These **OsGL1-6** antisense-RNA transgenic plants showed droopy leaves at the booting stage, significantly decreased leaf cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticle membrane, increased chlorophyll leaching and water loss rates, and enhanced drought sensitivity.
   - The **OsGL1-6** gene was constitutively expressed in all examined organs and was very highly expressed in leaf epidermal cells and vascular bundles.
   - Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the wax composition using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed a significantly reduced total cuticular wax load on the leaf blades of the **OsGL1-6** antisense-RNA transgenic plants as well as markedly decreased alkane and aldehyde contents.
