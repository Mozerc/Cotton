## Functional Descriptions:
   - Oryza sativa mediator subunit **OsMED25** interacts with OsBZR1 to regulate Brassinosteroid signaling and plant architecture in rice..
   - In addition, the **OsMED25**-RNAi and **OsMED25** mutant exhibited decreased BR sensitivity.
   - Together, these findings revealed that **OsMED25** regulates rice BR signaling by interacting with OsBZR1 and modulating the expression of OsBZR1 target genes, thus expanding our understanding of the roles of mediators in plant hormone signaling.
   - Phenotypic analyses showed that the **OsMED25**-RNAi and **OsMED25** mutant presented erect leaves, as observed in BR-deficient mutants.
   - Functional Analysis of OsMED16 and **OsMED25** in Response to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses in Rice.
   - We used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to study the functions of two genes, namely OsMED16 and **OsMED25** in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in rice.
   - Furthermore, the **OsMED25** mutants retarded JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence.
   - The results suggest that **OsMED25** participates in JA-mediated root development and OsMYC2-mediated leaf senescence in rice.
   - S-type lateral root densities in **OsMED25** mutants were lower than those in the WT, whereas L-type lateral root densities in **OsMED25** mutants were higher than those in the WT.
   - In the present study, we isolated the loss-of function mutant of MED25, **OsMED25**, through the map-based cloning and phenotypic complementation analysis by the introduction of **OsMED25** and investigated the role of **OsMED25** in JA signaling in rice.
   - Mutated **OsMED25** protein could not interact with OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling in rice.
   - The expression of JA-responsive senescence-associated genes was not upregulated in response to JA in the **OsMED25** mutants.
   - Phenotypic analyses revealed that **OsMED25**-RNAi and the **OsMED25** mutant plants exhibited enlarged panicles, with enhanced branching and spikelet number, similar to the dst mutant.
   - Genetic analysis indicated that **OsMED25** acts in the same pathway as the DST-OsCKX2 module to regulate spikelet number per panicle.
   - Thus, **OsMED25** was involved in the communication between DST and Pol II general transcriptional machinery to regulate spikelet number.
   - In general, our findings reveal a novel function of **OsMED25** in DST-OsCKX2 modulated transcriptional regulation, thus enhancing our understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying DST-OsCKX2-mediated spikelet number.
   - Furthermore, **OsMED25** interacted with some AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (OsARFs) that regulate auxin signaling, whereas the mutated **OsMED25** protein did not interact with the OsARFs.
   - The **OsMED25** loss-of-function mutant exhibited high resistance to Xoo.
   - The expression of JA-responsive defense-related genes regulated by OsMYC2, which is a positive TF in JA signaling, was downregulated in **OsMED25** mutants.
   - These results indicate that **OsMED25** plays an and auxin-mediated signaling in rice defense response.
   - The expression of auxin-responsive genes was downregulated in **OsMED25** mutants, and auxin-induced susceptibility to Xoo was not observed in **OsMED25** mutants.
