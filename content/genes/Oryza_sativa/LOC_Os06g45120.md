## Functional Descriptions:
   - A single cytosine deletion in the **OsPLS1** gene encoding vacuolar-type H+-ATPase subunit A1 leads to premature leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice.
   - The OsPSL1/VHA-A1 transcript levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in both the **OsPLS1** mutant and its wild type.
   - The significant decrease in both OsPSL1/VHA-A1 gene expression and VHA enzyme activity in the **OsPLS1** mutant strongly suggests a negative regulatory role for the normal **OsPLS1**/VHA-A1 gene in the onset of rice leaf senescence.
   - To conclude, **OsPLS1** is implicated in leaf senescence and seed dormancy in rice.
   - Despite normal development in early seedlings, the **OsPLS1** mutant leaves displayed lesion-mimics and early senescence, and a high transpiration rate after tillering.
   - Using a map-based cloning approach, we determined that a cytosine deletion in the **OsPLS1** gene encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit A1 (VHA-A1) underlies the phenotypic abnormalities in the **OsPLS1** mutant.
   - The **OsPLS1** mutant featured higher salicylic acid (SA) levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and activation of signal transduction by up-regulation of WRKY genes in leaves.
   - Consistent with this, the **OsPLS1** mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to exogenous SA and/or H2O2.
   - Physiological and Transcriptome Analyses of Early Leaf Senescence for **OsPLS1** Mutant Rice (Oryza sativa L.) during the Grain-Filling Stage.
   - Some antioxidative and carbohydrate metabolism-related genes were detected to be differentially expressed in the senescing leaves of **OsPLS1** mutant, suggesting that these genes probably play response and regulatory roles in leaf senescence.
   - Results showed that the **OsPLS1** mutant underwent significant decreases in the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry (Fv/Fm), net photosynthesis rate (Pn), and soluble sugar and protein, followed by the decreases in OsVHA-A transcript and vacuolar H<U+207A>-ATPase activity.
   - RNA-seq results showed that 4827 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in **OsPLS1** mutant between 0 day and 14 days, and the pathways of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and photosynthesis were downregulated in the senescing leaves of **OsPLS1** mutant during the grain-filling stage.
   - Finally, yield traits were severely suppressed in the **OsPLS1** mutant.
