## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g39610](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g39610)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0542100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0542100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsMT-II-1a
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Northern blot analysis showed that accumulation of **OsMT-II-1a** mRNA is specifically abundant in developing seeds and 2-day glumes after pollination, and **OsMT-II-1a** transcription can markedly be induced by H2O2, paraquat, SNP, ethephon, ABA and SA, but barely by metal ions or other exogenous abiotic factors such as low temperature and PEG.
   - Taken together, the above results suggest that the processes of pollination and seed development might be mediated, at least in part, by expression of the **OsMT-II-1a** gene that is regulated by several abiotic factors.
