## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g72690](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g72690)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0957000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0957000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsNADK1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - , OsWRKY21 and OsWRKY42, showed correlated co-expression patterns with **OsNADK1** in **OsNADK1** and the plants overexpressing or underexpressing **OsNADK1**, implying roles for these transcription factors in **OsNADK1**-mediated processes.
   - Moreover, certain stress-related genes showed differential expression patterns in **OsNADK1** under both normal growth and drought-stress conditions compared with WT.
   - Compared with wild-type (WT) rice, the mutant plant **OsNADK1** in which **OsNADK1** was knocked out was a dwarf at the heading stage and had decreased NADP(H)/NAD(H), ascorbic acid (ASA)/dehydroascorbate (DHA) and reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratios, which led to increased oxidation states in the rice cells and sensitivity to drought.
   - In addition, overexpression of **OsNADK1** enhanced the drought tolerance of rice plants, whereas loss of function of the gene reduced the tolerance.
   - The NAD kinase **OsNADK1** affects the intracellular redox balance and enhances the tolerance of rice to drought..
