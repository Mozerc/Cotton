- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **OsSHI1** encodes a plant-specific transcription factor of the SHORT INTERNODES (SHI) family with a characteristic family-specific IGGH domain and a conserved zinc-finger DNA binding domain.
   - **OsSHI1** is predominantly expressed in axillary buds and young panicle.
   - Further, **OsSHI1** represses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1 by affecting its DNA binding activity towards the promoters of both OsTB1 and OsDEP1, resulting in increased tiller number and diminished panicle size.
   - **OsSHI1** Regulates Plant Architecture Through Modulating the Transcriptional Activity of IPA1 in Rice.
   - Taken together, our results demonstrate that **OsSHI1** regulates plant architecture through modulating the transcriptional activity of IPA1 and provide novel insight into the establishment of plant architecture in rice.
