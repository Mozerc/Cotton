- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In spite of its prolonged juvenile phase, the **PPS**-1 mutant flowers early, and this is associated with derepression of RAP1B expression in **PPS**-1 plants independently of the Hd1-Hd3a/RFT1 photoperiodic pathway.
   - Its ability to regulate the vegetative phase change and the time of flowering suggests that rice **PPS** acquired novel functions during the evolution of rice/monocots.
   - The **COP1** ortholog PPS regulates the juvenile-adult and vegetative-reproductive phase changes in rice.
   - Although the early vegetative phase and flowering time of **PPS**-1 have been closely examined, the phenotypes in the late vegetative and reproductive phases are not yet well understood.
   - Role of rice **PPS** in late vegetative and reproductive growth.
   - Moreover, **PPS**-1 had a small inflorescence meristem and small panicles.
   - These phenotypes indicate that in **PPS**-1 the juvenile phase coexists with the late vegetative phase, resulting in small panicles.
   - Double mutant (d18-k **PPS**-1) showed the same phenotype as the **PPS**-1, indicating that **PPS** is upstream of GA biosynthetic genes.
   - In the ninth leaf blade of **PPS**-1, the relative length of the midrib was comparable to the sixth leaf blade of wild-type.
   - The **PPS**-1 mutant exhibits delayed expression of miR156 and miR172 and the suppression of GA biosynthetic genes, reducing the GA(3) content in this mutant.
   - The rice peter pan syndrome-1 (**PPS**-1) mutant shows a prolonged juvenile phase and early flowering.
   - **OsCOP1** regulates embryo development and flavonoid biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - These results demonstrate that **OsCOP1** is associated with embryo development and flavonoid biosynthesis in rice grains.
   - Novel mutations of **OsCOP1** were identified to be responsible for yellowish pericarp and embryo lethal phenotype, which revealed that **OsCOP1** plays a crucial role in flavonoid biosynthesis and embryogenesis in rice seed.
   - CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis was used to knock out **OsCOP1** by targeting its functional domains, and transgenic seed displayed the yel mutant phenotype.
   - Overexpression of **OsCOP1** in a homozygous yel-hc mutant background restored pericarp color, and the aberrant flavonoid accumulation observed in yel-hc mutant was significantly reduced in the embryo and endosperm.
   - This study will facilitate a better understanding of the functional roles of **OsCOP1** involved in early embryogenesis and flavonoid biosynthesis in rice seeds.
