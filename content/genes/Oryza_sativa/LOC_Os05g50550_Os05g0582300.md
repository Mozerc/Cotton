## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os05g50550](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g50550)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0582300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0582300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsSPS2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Green fluorescent protein fusion analyses showed that OsSPS1 localized to mitochondria, while **OsSPS2** localized to plastids.
   - This suggests that OsSPS1 is involved in the supply of solanesyl diphosphate for ubiquinone-9 biosynthesis in mitochondria, whereas **OsSPS2** is involved in providing solanesyl diphosphate for plastoquinone-9 formation.
   - However, an important biological difference was observed between the two genes: OsSPS1 complemented the yeast coq1 disruptant, which does not form UQ, whereas **OsSPS2** only very weakly complemented the growth defect of the coq1 mutant.
   - OsSPS1 was highly expressed in root tissue whereas **OsSPS2** was found to be high in both leaves and roots.
