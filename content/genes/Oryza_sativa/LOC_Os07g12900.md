- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, we isolated **OsHMA3**, a gene encoding a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter from Jarjan.
   - * In this study, using positional cloning and transgenic strategies, heavy metal ATPase 3 (**OsHMA3**) was identified as the gene that controls root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates.
   - * The allele of **OsHMA3** that confers high root-to-shoot Cd translocation rates (**OsHMA3**mc) encodes a defective P(1B) -ATPase transporter.
   - * We propose that the root cell cytoplasm of Cd-overaccumulating rice plants has more Cd available for loading into the xylem as a result of the lack of **OsHMA3**-mediated transportation of Cd to the vacuoles.
   - **OsHMA3**, a P1B-type of ATPase affects root-to-shoot cadmium translocation in rice by mediating efflux into vacuoles.
   - Our results indicated that **OsHMA3** from the low Cd-accumulating cultivar limits translocation of Cd from the roots to the above-ground tissues by selectively sequestrating Cd into the root vacuoles.
   - Rice **OsHMA3** is a vacuolar cadmium (Cd) transporter belonging to the P1B-ATPase family and has a long (273aa) C-terminal region.
   - Functional analysis of the C-terminal region of the vacuolar cadmium-transporting rice **OsHMA3**.
   - The **OsHMA3** protein was localized in all roots cells, but the sequence has a mutation leading to loss of function.
   - Therefore, failure to sequester Cd into the root vacuoles by **OsHMA3** is probably responsible for high Cd accumulation in Jarjan.
   - Overexpression of **OsHMA3** selectively reduces Cd accumulation in the grain.
   - Taken together, overexpression of **OsHMA3** is an efficient way to reduce Cd accumulation in the grain and to enhance Cd tolerance in rice.
   - As a member of the heavy metal ATPase (HMA) family, **OsHMA3** is a tonoplast-localized transporter for Cd in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Overexpression of **OsHMA3** enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice.
   - Further characterization in the present study revealed that overexpression of **OsHMA3** also enhances the tolerance to toxic Cd.
   - A loss-of-function allele of **OsHMA3** associated with high cadmium accumulation in shoots and grain of Japonica rice cultivars.
   - Our study has identified a new loss-of-function allele of **OsHMA3** in Japonica rice cultivars leading to high Cd accumulation in shoots and grain.
   - Furthermore, **OsHMA3** protein was detected in the root pericycle cells and phloem region of both the diffuse vascular bundle and the enlarged vascular bundle of the nodes.
   - Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing **OsHMA3** under the control of OsHMA2 promoter.
   - These results indicate that expression of **OsHMA3** under the control of OsHMA2 promoter can effectively reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain through sequestering more Cd into the vacuoles of various tissues.
   - We found that the two GCC7 alleles, GCC7PA64s and GCC793-11 , had different promoter activity of **OsHMA3**, leading to different **OsHMA3** expression and different shoot and grain Cd concentrations.
   - Natural variation in the promoter of **OsHMA3** contributes to differential grain cadmium accumulation between Indica and Japonica rice.
   - Our results thus reveal that the QTL GCC7 with sequence variation in the **OsHMA3** promoter is an important determinant controlling differential grain Cd accumulation between Indica and Japonica rice.
   - Taken together, we have identified a new allele of **OsHMA3** with a total loss of function, resulting in a greatly elevated Cd translocation to the shoots and grain of rice.
   - Map-based cloning of a new total loss-of-function allele of **OsHMA3** causing high cadmium accumulation in rice grain.
   - By comparing rice accessions with functional allele of **OsHMA3** with accessions with loss of function allele of **OsHMA3**, we found that accessions with functional **OsHMA3** showed higher tolerance to high Zn than those with non-functional **OsHMA3** based on root elongation test.
   - When exposed to Zn-free solution, the Zn concentration in the root cell sap was rapidly decreased in the accessions with functional **OsHMA3**, but less changed in the accessions with non-functional **OsHMA3**.
   - A tonoplast-localized **OsHMA3** plays an important role in maintaining Zn homeostasis in rice.
   - Comprehensive analysis of variation of cadmium accumulation in rice and detection of a new weak allele of **OsHMA3**.
   - However, Ca application facilitated the upward translocation of Cd by both upregulating OsHMA2 to induce xylem loading of Cd and downregulating **OsHMA3** to reduce vacuolar sequestration of Cd.
   - Meanwhile, application of sufficient doses of Fe and Cd in solution culture increased RE of CAL1, OsNRAMP5, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsNAAT1 in roots, whereas expression level of **OsHMA3** was decreased.
   - Cadmium inhibits lateral root emergence in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution and the protective effect of **OsHMA3**.
   - Overexpression of functional **OsHMA3** in rice greatly alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd, but the protective effect of **OsHMA3** was abolished by the auxin polar transport inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid.
   - The results suggest that Cd inhibits LR development in rice by disrupting OsPIN-mediated auxin distribution to LPR and **OsHMA3** protects against Cd toxicity by sequestering Cd into the vacuoles.
   - The emergence of LRs in a rice cultivar with a null allele of **OsHMA3** (Heavy Metal ATPase 3) was more sensitive to Cd than cultivars with functional alleles.
   - Furthermore, the expression of the Cd transporter genes, OsHMA2, **OsHMA3** and OsLCT1 were curtailed in NPs-treated rice plants under normal and drought stress conditions.
