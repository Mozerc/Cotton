## Functional Descriptions:
   - The locus sh-h for shattering was tightly linked to the **Rc** locus conferring red pericarp, as well as a QTL qSD(s)-7-1 for seed dormancy, implying that this region might represent a domestication block in the evolutionary pathway of rice.
   - This research delimited **qSD7-1**/qPC7 to the Os07g11020 or Rc locus encoding a basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor by intragenic recombinants and provided unambiguous evidence that the association arises from pleiotropy.
   - The breaking tensile strength (BTS) of the grain pedicel was measured using a digital fo**Rc**e gauge to evaluate the degree of shattering of rice varieties at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 days after heading (DAH).
   - **Rc** is a domestication-related gene required for red pericarp in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - The association was linked to **qSD7-1**/qPC7, a cluster of quantitative trait loci for seed dormancy/pericarp color in weedy red rice.
   - Here, we examined three more FNPs in two domestication-related genes involved in pigment synthesis during the development of seed pericarp color (**Rc** and Rd) in 91 landraces (and some modern cultivars) of japonica rice collected from throughout the area of distribution of rice.
   - The **Rc** locus regulates pigmentation of the rice bran layer, and selection for the **Rc** allele (white pericarp) occurred during domestication of the crop.
   - A natural mutation in **Rc** reverts white-rice-pericarp to red and results in a new, dominant, wild-type allele: **Rc**-g.
   - Brown-colored seeds were obtained from transgenic plants by the introduction of a gene containing the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif, demonstrating that the **Rc** gene encodes a bHLH protein.
   - In some cases, white pericarps in African rice are apparently caused by unique mutations at the **Rc** gene, which also controls pericarp colour variation in Asian rice.
   - The molecular basis of white pericarps in African domesticated rice: novel mutations at the **Rc** gene.
   - The dormancy effect could be eliminated by a heat treatment, but could not be completely ove**Rc**ome by gibberellic acid or physical removal of the seed maternal tissues.
   - A little less than one Mb of japonica DNA hitchhiked with the **Rc** allele into most indica varieties, suggesting that other linked domestication alleles may have been transferred from japonica to indica along with white pericarp color.
   - By sequencing the **Rc** locus in plants derived from red seeds, and linkage analysis in a segregating population, we were able to demonstrate that mutation within **Rc** resulted in the new, dominant, wild-type allele **Rc**-g.
   - RT-PCR experiments confirmed that the **Rc** gene was expressed in both red- and white-grained rice but that a shortened transcript was present in white varieties.
   - The **Rc** and Rd genes are involved in proanthocyanidin synthesis in rice pericarp.
   - In this model, the critical role of the **Rc** FNP at an early step of the domestication process was highlighted.
   - Here we report that the change from the red seeds of wild rice to the white seeds of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) resulted from the strong selective sweep of a single mutation, a frame-shift deletion within the **Rc** gene that is found in 97.
   - Caught red-handed: **Rc** encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein conditioning red pericarp in rice.
   - The **Rc**Rd genotype produces red pericarp in wild species Oryza rufipogon, whereas most cultivated rice varieties produce white grains resulted from a 14-bp frame-shift deletion in the seventh exon of the **Rc** gene.
   - In the present study, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated method to functionally restore the recessive **Rc** allele through reverting the 14-bp frame-shift deletion to in-frame mutations in which the deletions were in multiples of three bases, and successfully converted three elite white pericarp rice varieties into red ones.
   - Transcription Factors **Rc** and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice.
   - To identify this association's molecular mechanism, a PHS mutant Osviviparous1 (Osvp1) was characterized in rice and crossed with Kasalath, a red pericarp cultivar with **Rc** (red coleoptiles) genotype.
   - Moreover, OsVP1 can directly bind **Rc** (bHLH) promoter by yeast one-hybrid, which activates **Rc** and OsLAR expression in red pericarp rice.
   - SNPs located in or close to **Rc** were particularly predictive of the occurrence of seed coat color and our results showed that different sub-populations required different SNPs for a better seed coat color prediction.
   - The significant single nucleotide polymorphism in the most prominent region was located within the **Rc** gene, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor.
   - Identification of the rice **Rc** gene as a main regulator of seed survival under dry storage conditions..
   - In the seed pericarp, a functional **Rc** gene results in accumulation of proanthocyanidins, an important sub-class of flavonoids having strong antioxidant activity, which may explain the variation in tolerance to dry EPPO aging.
   - Storage experiments using near-isogenic rice lines (SD7-1D (**Rc**) and SD7-1d (**Rc**) with the same allelic variation confirmed the role of the wildtype **Rc** gene, providing stronger tolerance to dry EPPO aging.
