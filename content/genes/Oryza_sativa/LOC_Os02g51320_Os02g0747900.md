## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we report the involvement of another atypical bHLH protein gene, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 (**PGL2**), in the regulation of rice grain length.
   - Over-expression of **PGL2** in the lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in correlation with the level of transgene expression.
   - **PGL2** interacts with a typical bHLH protein APG, a negative regulator of rice grain length and weight, in vitro and in vivo.
   - It was reported that overexpression of BU1 (BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1), the closest homolog of **PGL2**, caused an increase in grain length.
   - These findings suggest that **PGL2** and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of **PGL2**, controls grain length is independent of APG.
   - Observation of the inner epidermal cells of lemma of **PGL2**-overexpressing lines revealed that the long grain size is caused by an increase in cell length.
   - Rice leaf angle and grain size are affected by the **OsBUL1** transcriptional activator complex.
   - Transgenic rice plants expressing OsBC1 under the control of **OsBUL1** promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of OsBC1 displayed reduced plant height and grain size.
   - **OsBUL1** knockout mutant (**OsBUL1**) and transgenic rice for double stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of **OsBUL1** produced erected leaves with smaller grains whereas **OsBUL1** overexpressors and an activation tagging line of **OsBUL1** exhibited increased laminar inclination and grain size.
   - To understand the molecular network of **OsBUL1** function in rice, we isolated a novel **OsBUL1**-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif and functionally studied it with respect to the laminar inclination and grain size of rice.
   - **OsBUL1** COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic HLH (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with **OsBUL1** only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the laminar joint of rice.
   - Three candidates, OsbHLH153, **OsbHLH173** and OsbHLH174, quickly responded to BR and IAA involved in plant architecture except for **OsbHLH173**, whose expression level was too low to be detected; their overexpression in plants increased rice leaf angle.
   - OsbHLH98 Regulates Leaf Angle in Rice Through Transcriptional Repression of **OsBUL1**.
   - Our results demonstrate that OsbHLH98 negatively regulates leaf angle by counteracting brassinosteroid-induced cell elongation via the repression of **OsBUL1** transcription.
