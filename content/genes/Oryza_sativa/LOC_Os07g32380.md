- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Under Pi-sufficient conditions, Pi levels were lower in young leaves and higher in old leaves in **OsPP95** mutants than in those of the wild type, even though the overall shoot Pi levels were the same in the mutant and the wild type.
   - Rice plants overexpressing **OsPP95** reduced OsPT8 phosphorylation and promoted OsPT2 and OsPT8 trafficking from the ER to the PM, resulting in Pi accumulation.
   - In the wild type, **OsPP95** accumulated under Pi starvation but was rapidly degraded under Pi-sufficient conditions.
   - We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase **OsPP95** interacts with OsPT2 and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517.
