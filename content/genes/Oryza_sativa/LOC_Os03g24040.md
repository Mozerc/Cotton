- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0356414](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0356414)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsDIS1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we also show that **OsDIS1** interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice.
   - Overexpression of **OsDIS1** reduced drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants, while RNA interference silencing of **OsDIS1** enhanced drought tolerance.
   - We recently showed that **OsDIS1** (Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a SINA type E3 ligase, is involved in the drought-stress signal transduction in rice.
   - **OsDIS1** plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through the transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and also possibly through the posttranslational regulation of its interacting protein OsNek6 in rice.
   - Here, we report that **OsDIS1** (for Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a C3HC4 RING finger E3 ligase, is involved in drought-stress signal transduction in rice (O.
   - The expression of **OsDIS1** was up-regulated by drought treatment.
   - Microarray analysis revealed that a large number of drought-responsive genes were induced or suppressed in the **OsDIS1** overexpression plants under normal and drought conditions.
   - Together, these results demonstrate that **OsDIS1** plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and possibly through posttranslational regulation of OsNek6 in rice.
   - The SINA E3 ligase **OsDIS1** negatively regulates drought response in rice.
