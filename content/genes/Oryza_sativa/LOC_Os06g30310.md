## Functional Descriptions:
   - Disruption of a rice gene for alpha-glucan water dikinase, **OsGWD1**, leads to hyperaccumulation of starch in leaves but exhibits limited effects on growth.
   - Analysis of the **GWD1** plants indicated that promoter editing mediated down-regulation of **GWD1** caused no observable effects on rice growth and development, but only mildly modified its grain transparency and seed germination.
   - Therefore, our study shows that **GWD1** is not only involved in transitory starch degradation in source tissues, but also plays key roles in the seeds, which is a sink tissue.
   - In conclusion, we find that **GWD1** is an ideal biotechnological target with promising potential for the breeding of elite rice cultivars via genetic engineering.
