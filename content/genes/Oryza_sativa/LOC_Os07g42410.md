## Functional Descriptions:
   - The SRS1 gene is identical to the previously identified DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 (**DEP2**).
   - Despite a more compact plant type in the **DEP2** mutant, no significant alteration in grain production was found between wild type and **DEP2** mutant.
   - The SMALL AND ROUND SEED1 (SRS1/**DEP2**) gene is involved in the regulation of seed size in rice.
   - In addition, **EP2** also regulates other panicle characteristics, such as panicle length and grain size, but grain number per panicle shows little change, indicating that the mutation of the **EP2** gene could be applied in EP-type indica rice breeding.
   - Here, we identified two allelic erect-panicle mutants in indica rice, erect panicle2-1 (**EP2**-1) and erect panicle2-2 (**EP2**-2), exhibiting the characteristic erect panicle phenotype.
   - Anatomical investigations revealed that the **EP2** mutants have more vascular bundles and a thicker stem than that of wild-type plants, explaining the panicle erectness phenotype in **EP2** mutants.
   - Here, dense and erect panicle 2 (**DEP2**) mutant, which shows a dense and erect panicle phenotype, was identified.
   - Expression profiling of **DEP2** revealed that it is highly expressed in young tissues, with most abundance in young panicles.
   - Morphological and expression analysis indicated that mutation in **DEP2** mainly affects the rapid elongation of rachis and primary and secondary branches, but does not impair the initiation or formation of panicle primordia.
   - Further analysis suggests that decrease of panicle length in **DEP2** is caused by a defect in cell proliferation during the exponential elongation of panicle.
   - Therefore, the study of **DEP2** not only strengthens our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of panicle architecture but also has important implications for rice breeding.
   - It was shown that **EP2** was specifically expressed in the vascular bundles of internodes by GUS staining and RT-PCR.
   - In the longitudinal direction of the lemma, both cell length and cell number are reduced in **SRS1**-1 compared to the wild type, whereas in the lateral cross section of the lemma, cell length in **SRS1**-1 is greater than that in the wild type, but the cell number in **SRS1**-1 is the same as that in wild type.
   - These results suggest that the small and round seed phenotype of **SRS1**-1 is due to the reduction in both cell length and cell number in the longitudinal direction, and the elongation of the cells in the lateral direction of the lemma.
   - The **SRS1** mRNA and proteins are abundant in wild type rice specifically in young organs, namely young leaves, internodes and panicles.
   - The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant 1 (**SRS1**) was identified in rice by map-based cloning and named SMALL AND ROUND SEED 1 (**SRS1**).
   - **OsRELA** Regulates Leaf Inclination by Repressing the Transcriptional Activity of OsLIC in Rice.
   - We obtained a mutant rela (regulator of leaf angle) with reduced leaf angle in rice by EMS mutagenesis, and map-based cloning revealed that **OsRELA** encodes a protein of unknown function.
   - The binding of **OsRELA** can activate the expression of downstream genes repressed by OsLIC, such as OsILI1, a positive regulator of leaf inclination in rice.
   - Therefore, our results suggest that **OsRELA** can act as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in the regulation of leaf inclination by regulating the transcriptional activity of OsLIC.
   - Biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that **OsRELA** is able to interact with OsLIC, a negative regulator of BR signaling, through its conserved C-terminal domain, which is essential for **OsRELA** function in rice.
