## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os11g46980](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os11g46980)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>RKe</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptional activation of N**RKe** or 9**RKe** resulted in the formation of temperature-sensitive lesion mimics, which were spots of dead cells associated with accumulation of superoxides, in different organs of the transgenic plants.
   - CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the **RKe** locus is involved in rice response to raised temperature.
   - The LRR domain of **RKe** protein appears to be important to sense increased temperature.
   - The **RKe**-involved temperature-related pathway and Xa3/Xa26-mediated disease-resistance pathway may partially overlap.
