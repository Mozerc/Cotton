## Functional Descriptions:
   - Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of **FCP1** and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by **FCP1** (FCP2).
   - Constitutive expression of **FCP1** results in consumption of the SAM in the vegetative phase, and application of an **FCP1** CLE peptide in vitro disturbs root development by misspecification of cell fates in the RAM.
   - Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (**FCP1**/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, **FCP1** appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM.
   - In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (**FCP1**) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase.
   - Thus, **FCP1**/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice.
   - WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene **FCP1** in rice.
   - Here, we examined the role of **FCP1** in leaf development.
   - We found that overexpression of **FCP1** affects various aspects of leaf development in shoots regenerated from calli, making it difficult to distinguish between the leaf blade and leaf sheath.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that **FCP1** is involved in the regulation of cell fate determination during leaf development.
   - Differentiation of tissues such as vascular bundle and sclerenchyma was strongly inhibited by **FCP1** overexpression.
