## Functional Descriptions:
   - An ethylene response factor **OsWR1** responsive to drought stress transcriptionally activates wax synthesis related genes and increases wax production in rice.
   - In addition, **OsWR1** activated the expression of the genes-related to oxidative stress response and membrane stability.
   - Functional analyses indicated that overexpressing **OsWR1** (Ox-WR1) improved while RNA interference **OsWR1** rice (RI-WR1) decreased drought tolerance, consistent with water loss and cuticular permeability, suggesting that **OsWR1**-triggered drought response might be associated with cuticular characteristics.
   - Thus our results indicate that **OsWR1** is a positive regulator of wax synthesis related genes in rice, and this regulation, distinct from its homology regulator of WIN1/SHN1 in cutin synthesis, subsequently contributes to reduced water loss and enhanced drought tolerance.
   - Transcript analysis showed that **OsWR1** is induced by drought, abscisic acid and salt, and is predominantly expressed in leaves.
   - This rice wax synthesis regulatory gene 1 (**OsWR1**) is a homolog of Arabidopsis wax/cutin synthesis regulatory gene WIN1/SHN1.
