## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our data provide mechanistic insights into a unique role for **RFL** in determining the typical rice plant architecture by regulating distinct downstream pathways.
   - These results offer a means to alter rice flowering time and plant architecture by manipulating **RFL**-mediated pathways.
   - Distinct regulatory role for **RFL**, the rice LFY homolog, in determining flowering time and plant architecture.
   - To better understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate inflorescence and flower architecture, we characterized the rice aberrant panicle organization 2 (**APO2**) mutant which exhibits small panicles with reduced number of primary branches due to the precocious formation of spikelet meristems.
   - The **APO2** mutants also display a shortened plastochron in the vegetative phase, late flowering, aberrant floral organ identities and loss of floral meristem determinacy.
   - Further analysis indicated that **APO2**/RFL and APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development.
   - Aside from facilitating a transition of the main growth axis to an inflorescence meristem, **RFL** expression status affects vegetative axillary meristems and therefore regulates tillering.
   - The unique spatially and temporally regulated **RFL** expression during the development of vegetative axillary bud (tiller) primordia and inflorescence branch primordia is therefore required to produce tillers and panicle branches, respectively.
   - Diverse orthologous LFY genes regulate vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition when expressed in Arabidopsis, a property not shared by **RFL**, the homolog in the agronomically important grass, rice.
   - After the transition to reproductive stage, **RFL** RNA was detected in all layers of very young panicle including the apical meristem, but absent in the incipient primary branches.
   - ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/**RFL**, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1.
   - In particular, **APO2**/RFL and LFY act oppositely on inflorescence development.
   - Northern analysis showed that **RFL** is expressed predominantly in very young panicle but not in mature florets, mature leaves, or roots.
   - Expression pattern of **RFL** raised a possibility that, unlike FLO and LFY, **RFL** might be involved in panicle branching.
   - Down-regulation of **RFL**, the FLO/LFY homolog of rice, accompanied with panicle branch initiation.
   - In situ hybridization revealed that **RFL** RNA was expressed in epidermal cells in young leaves at vegetative growth stage.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **APO2** is identical to previously reported RFL gene, the rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis LEAFY (LFY) gene.
   - In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal **RFL** as a regulator of OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering.
   - We find that reduction in **RFL** expression causes a dramatic delay in transition to flowering, with the extreme phenotype being no flowering.
   - Conversely, **RFL** overexpression triggers precocious flowering.
   - In 35S-**RFL** plants, transformation of inflorescence meristem to floral meristem was rarely observed.
   - As development of branches proceeds, **RFL** RNA accumulation localized in the developing branches except for the apical meristems of the branches and secondary branch primordia.
   - Instead, development of cotyledons, rosette leaves, petals, and stamens was severely affected, demonstrating that **RFL** function is distinct from that of LFY.
   - To examine whether same mechanisms control floral development in distantly related species such as grasses, we isolated **RFL**, FLO-LFY homolog of rice, and examined its expression and function.
   - Transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing **RFL** from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were produced to test whether 35S-**RFL** would cause similar phenotype as observed in 35S-LFY plants.
   - Previous studies showed that knockdown of the transcription factor gene **RFL** reduced tillering and caused a very large decrease in panicle branching.
   - Functions for rice **RFL** in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.
   - Further, we report reduced expression of auxin transporter genes OsPIN1 and OsPIN3 in the culm of **RFL** knockdown transgenic plants.
   - Additionally, subtle change in the spatial pattern of IR4 DR5:GFP auxin reporter was observed, which hints at compromised auxin transport on **RFL** knockdown.
   - Together, we have found that **RFL** regulates the LAX1 and CUC genes during AM specification, and positively influences the outgrowth of AMs though its effects on auxin transport.
   - The relationship between **RFL**, strigolactone signalling, and bud outgrowth was studied by transcript analyses and by the tillering phenotype of transgenic plants knocked down for both **RFL** and D3.
   - The in situ hybridization result showed that, when florets appear, **RFL** was expressed almost exclusively at the palea/lemma adaxial base adjacent to lodicules in the wild-type panicle.
   - The far-upstream regulatory region of **RFL** is required for its precise spatial-temporal expression for floral development in rice.
   - The results suggest that the far-upstream region of **RFL** may contain potential cis element(s) that are critical to define the precise spatial-temporal expression pattern of **RFL** for its function in floral development.
   - A disruption of sequence integrity at 6292-bp upstream of **RFL** by a T-DNA insertion led to varied **RFL** expression patterns in floral meristem and floret in afo1 and caused the mutant phenotype.
   - Here, we describe a rice aberrant floral organ 1 (afo1) mutant that was produced by a T-DNA insertion at 6292-bp upstream of the start codon of **RFL**.
   - This insertion altered the expression of **RFL** in floral meristem (FM) and floret.
   - The altered pattern of **RFL** expression in afo1 resulted in enlarged FMs, more floral organs, aberrant floral organ identity, and loss of FM determinacy.
   - Genetic analyses support that LARGE2 functions with APO1 and **APO2** in a common pathway to regulate panicle size and grain number.
   - Our findings indicate that **APO2** acts as a master regulator of rice panicle development by regulating multiple steps in the reproductive transition through directly controlling a set of genes.
   - **APO2** is a positive regulator of panicle branch formation.
   - These analyses showed that **APO2** directly controls known regulators of panicle development, including SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE14 and NECK LEAF1.
   - Furthermore, we revealed that a set of genes act as downstream regulators of **APO2** in controlling meristem cell proliferation during reproductive transition, bract suppression, and panicle branch formation.
   - Here, we show that **APO2** is also required to increase the meristem size of the IM and suppress bract outgrowth.
