## Functional Descriptions:
   - We previously demonstrated that the rice cell-wall invertase (CWI) gene **GIF1** that plays an important role in the grain-filling process was most likely subjected to domestication selection in the promoter region.
   - Results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that OsCIN1 was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to **GIF1** that was selected in the promoter region.
   - Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes **GIF1** and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication.
   - Here we report the isolation and functional analysis of the rice **GIF1** (GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1) gene that encodes a cell-wall invertase required for carbon partitioning during early grain-filling.
   - The cultivated **GIF1** gene shows a restricted expression pattern during grain-filling compared to the wild rice allele, probably a result of accumulated mutations in the gene's regulatory sequence through domestication.
   - Fine mapping with introgression lines revealed that the wild rice **GIF1** is responsible for grain weight reduction.
   - Ectopic expression of the cultivated **GIF1** gene with the 35S or rice Waxy promoter resulted in smaller grains, whereas overexpression of **GIF1** driven by its native promoter increased grain production.
   - Taken together, our study reveals that sugar homeostasis mediated by **GIF1** plays an important role in constitutive and induced physical and chemical defence.
   - Sugar homeostasis mediated by cell wall invertase GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (**GIF1**) plays a role in pre-existing and induced defence in rice.
   - These findings, together with the domestication signature that we identified by comparing nucleotide diversity of the **GIF1** loci between cultivated and wild rice, strongly suggest that **GIF1** is a potential domestication gene and that such a domestication-selected gene can be used for further crop improvement.
   - In this study, we observed that the grains of **GIF1**, a loss-of-function mutant of the cell wall invertase gene GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (**GIF1**), were hypersusceptible to postharvest fungal pathogens, with decreased levels of sugars and a thinner glume cell wall in comparison with the wild-type.
   - Moreover, the cell wall was much thicker in the infection sites of the **GIF1**-OE plants when compared with the wild-type plants.
   - We previously showed that upregulation of **OsGIF1** expression improves rice grain size.
   - Overexpression and functional knock-out via a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy revealed that **OsGIF1** not only positively regulates the sizes of rice leaf, stem, and grain but also influences rice reproduction.
   - Expression profiles based on both qRT-PCR and GUS (<a6><c2>-glucuronidase) histochemical staining suggested that **OsGIF1** is differentially expressed across various rice tissues, consistent with its roles in regulating the development of multiple rice organs.
   - Our results suggest that **OsGIF1** plays important roles in vegetative and reproductive developmental processes, with important implications for rice breeding.
   - Here, we report pleiotropic effects of **OsGIF1** on rice organ size regulation.
   - Further histological analysis suggested that **OsGIF1** affected rice organ size possibly by regulating cell size.
   - Representative of the white-belly phenotype, grains of **WB1** showed a higher grain chalkiness rate and degree and a lower 1000-grain weight (decreased by ~34%), in comparison with that of Wild Type (WT).
   - Nipponbare demonstrates that **WB1** regulates endosperm development and that different mutations of **WB1** disrupt its biological function.
   - The **WB1** mutant develops a white-belly endosperm and abnormal starch granules in the inner portion of white grains.
   - Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a recessive mutation of White Belly 1 (**WB1**), which regulates rice endosperm development, using a modified MutMap method in the rice mutant **WB1**.
   - Transcript levels analysis of all candidate genes showed that **WB1** (Os04t0413500), encoding a cell-wall invertase, was the most probable cause of white-belly endosperm phenotype.
