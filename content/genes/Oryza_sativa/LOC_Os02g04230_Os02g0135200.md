- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0135200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0135200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsMPK13,OsBIMK2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **OsBIMK2** was also up-regulated during early stage after inoculation with MAGNAPORTHE GRISEA in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during an incompatible interaction between M.
   - Expression of **OsBIMK2** was activated upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance in rice.
   - Over-expression of the rice **OsBIMK2** gene in transgenic tobacco resulted in an enhanced disease resistance against tomato mosaic virus and a fungal pathogen, ALTERNARIA ALTERNATA.
   - These results suggest that **OsBIMK2** plays a role in disease resistance responses.
   - A novel rice MAPK gene, **OsBIMK2**, is involved in disease-resistance responses.
