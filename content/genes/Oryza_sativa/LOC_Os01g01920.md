## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **WFSL1** displayed white fine stripe leaves since tillering stage and abnormal chloroplast structure.
   - RNA-seq analysis revealed that chloroplast development and photosynthesis genes were significantly affected in **WFSL1** plants.
   - Levels of **WFSL1** and chloroplast encoded proteins were decreased in **WFSL1** mutants via western blot analysis.
   - Compared with WT, **WFSL1** exhibits lower Chl content and defective in biogenesis of chloroplast ribosomes, which resulted in reduced grain yield.
   - Taken together, our results show that **WFSL1** is critical for chloroplast development, ribosome biogenesis, and light energy utilization, finally affects grain yield.
   - Map-based cloning and Bioinformatic analysis indicated that **WFSL1** on chromosome 1 contains an &quot;A&quot; to &quot;T&quot; substitution in protein coding region, and encodes a putative metal-dependent phosphohydrolase with HD domain at the N-terminus.
   - Here, we isolated and characterized the **STRIPE3** (st3) mutant which exhibited white-striped leaves with reduced chlorophyll content and abnormal chloroplast development during the seedling stage, but gradually produced nearly normal green leaves as it developed.
   - In addition, the ROS accumulation level was significantly elevated, and the ROS scavenging enzyme activity was significantly decreased in **WSL214** leaf tissue.
   - As a result of elevated ROS levels, **WSL214** leaf cells underwent DNA damage and programmed cell death.
   - The **WSL214** encodes an HD domain phosphohydrolase and is widely expressed in various tissues of rice, especially at the highest level in leaf tissue.
   - Further research showed that **WSL214** promoted the homeostasis of rice leaf cellular ROS in two ways.
   - Compared to WT, **WSL214** exhibited white-striped leaves, defective chloroplast development, reduced net photosynthetic rate, and overexcitation of photosynthetically active reaction centers.
   - Â Second, **WSL214** promoted chloroplast development, kept photosynthesis working properly, and reduced ROS produced by photosynthesis.
   - **WSL214** negatively regulates ROS accumulation and pathogen defense response in rice.
   - However, **WSL214** defense response to exogenous pathogens was also enhanced by high ROS levels.
   - **WSL214** plays an important role in promoting cellular ROS homeostasis by enhancing catalase activity and reducing photosynthetic ROS production.
   - First, **WSL214** increased the expression of the catalase gene OsCATC, making the intracellular ROS scavenging enzyme more active.
