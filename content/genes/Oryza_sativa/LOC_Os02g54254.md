## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsLKR**/SDH was highly expressed in the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm.
   - Here, we show that **OsLKR**/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF.
   - This result was in contrast to the fact that a significant reduction of SSP was observed only when these transcription factors were simultaneously reduced, suggesting that RISBZ1 and RPBF regulate SSP genes and **OsLKR**/SDH with high and limited redundancy, respectively.
   - L), a bifunctional **OsLKR**/SDH is predominantly present in seeds.
   - Reducing either RISBZ1 or RPBF decreased **OsLKR**/SDH levels, resulting in an increase in free lysine content in rice grain.
