## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, microRNA5144 (osa-miR5144-3p) is reported to mediate the formation of protein disulfide bonds via targeting **OsPDIL1;1** mRNA in rice seeds and seedlings during development and under conditions of abiotic stress, respectively.
   - These results indicate that protein-disulfide bond formation catalyzed by **OsPDIL1;1** is modulated by osa-miR5144-3p in rice during development and is involved in resistance to abiotic stress.
   - In contrast, the transgenic rice plants overexpressing osa-miR5144-3p or down-expressing **OsPDIL1;1** resulted in a lower protein-disulfide bond content; they were susceptible to abiotic stress and produced abnormal grains with small and loosely packed starch granules.
   - Expression of osa-miR5144-3p and **OsPDIL1;1** were shown to be inversely regulated in developing organs and under abiotic stress.
