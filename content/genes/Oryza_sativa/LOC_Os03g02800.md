## Functional Descriptions:
   - One mutant, designated **RIM1**-1, did not show typical disease symptoms upon infection with RDV.
   - These results suggest that **RIM1** may represent a new molecular link in jasmonate signaling, and may thereby provide new insights into the well-established coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1)-Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) JA signaling pathway.
   - The NAC transcription factor **RIM1** of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling.
   - Here, we report that **RIM1** functions as a transcriptional regulator of JA signaling and is degraded in response to JA treatment via a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway.
   - The expression profiles of the mutants were significantly correlated with those of JA-treated wild-type plants without accumulation of endogenous JA, indicating that **RIM1** functions as a component of JA signaling.
   - The expression of genes encoding JA biosynthetic enzymes (lipoxygenase (LOX), allene oxide synthase 2 (AOS2) and OPDA reductase 7 (OPR7)) was up-regulated in the **RIM1** mutants under normal conditions, and a rapid and massive accumulation of endogenous JA was detected in the mutants after wounding.
   - We recently identified the NAC transcription factor **RIM1** as a host factor involved in multiplication of rice dwarf virus (RDV).
   - Plants carrying **RIM1** mutations show a phenotype of root growth inhibition.
   - The **RIM1**-1 mutant remained susceptible to the two other viruses tested, one of which is also transmitted by leafhoppers, suggesting that the multiplication rather than transmission of RDV is specifically impaired in this mutant.
   - Multilayered regulation of membrane-bound **ONAC054** is essential for abscisic acid-induced leaf senescence in rice.
   - Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) NAM/ATAF<U+00BD>/CUC2 (NAC) transcription factor **ONAC054** plays an important role in ABA-induced leaf senescence.
   - **ONAC054** knockout mutants maintained green leaves, while **ONAC054**-overexpressing lines showed early leaf yellowing under dark- and ABA-induced senescence conditions.
   - The significance of this multilayered regulation of **ONAC054** for ABA-induced leaf senescence is also discussed.
   - Genome-wide microarray analysis showed that ABA signaling-associated genes, including ABA INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) and senescence-associated genes, including STAY-GREEN and NON-YELLOW COLORING1 (NYC1), were significantly downregulated in **ONAC054** mutants.
   - Multilayered Regulation of Membrane-Bound **ONAC054** Is Essential for Abscisic Acid-Induced Leaf Senescence in Rice.
   - Here, we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) NAM/ATAF1/2/CUC2 (NAC) transcription factor **ONAC054** plays an important role in ABA-induced leaf senescence.
   - The **ONAC054** knockout mutants maintained green leaves, while **ONAC054**-overexpressing lines showed early leaf yellowing under dark- and ABA-induced senescence conditions.
   - Genome-wide microarray analysis showed that ABA signaling-associated genes, including ABA INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) and senescence-associated genes, including STAY-GREEN and NON-YELLOW COLORING1 (NYC1), were significantly down-regulated in **ONAC054** mutants.
