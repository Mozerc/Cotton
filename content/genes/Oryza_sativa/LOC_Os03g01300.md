## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g01300](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g01300)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0103100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0103100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** Ltp1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **Ltp1** transcripts were found to strongly accumulate in response to inoculation with the fungal agent of the blast disease, Magnaporthe grisea, in two rice cultivars exhibiting compatible or incompatible host-pathogen interactions.
   - Analysis of pdelta1176Gus leaf samples inoculated with the blast fungus demonstrated that the **Ltp1** promoter is induced in all cell types of tissues surrounding the lesion and notably in stomata guard cells.
   - Histochemical and fluorometric GUS assays and in situ detection of uidA transcripts in transgenic homozygous lines harbouring the pdelta1176Gus construct demonstrated that the **Ltp1** promoter is preferentially active in aerial vegetative and reproductive organs and that both specificity and level of expression are regulated during organ development.
