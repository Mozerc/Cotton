## Functional Descriptions:
   - NIMA-related kinase) and **DCW11** encoding a mitochondrial putative protein phosphatase 2C were found in our previous microarray study as down-regulated genes in the rice CW-CMS line, which lacked pollen germination ability.
   - These results suggest that OsNek3 is downstream of **DCW11** in retrograde signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus and is involved in CW-CMS.
   - Cytoplasmic male sterility-related protein kinase, OsNek3, is regulated downstream of mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2C, **DCW11**.
   - **DCW11** mRNA was preferentially expressed in anthers, with the highest expression in mature pollen.
   - Knockdown of **DCW11** in wild-type rice by RNA interference caused a major loss of seed-set fertility, without visible defect in pollen development.
   - Our result indicates that **DCW11** could play a role as a mitochondrial signal transduction mediator in pollen germination.
   - As predicted by the N-terminal sequence, **DCW11** signal peptide-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein was localized in mitochondria.
   - This idea was supported by the up-regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in **DCW11** knockdown lines.
   - **DCW11**, down-regulated gene 11 in CW-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice, encoding mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2c is related to cytoplasmic male sterility.
