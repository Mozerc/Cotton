## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DEAP1** encodes a plasma membrane-associated member of group III plant FLAs and is specifically and temporally expressed in reproductive cells and the tapetum layer during male development.
   - Gene expression studies revealed reduced transcript accumulation of genes related to exine formation, aperture patterning, and tapetum development in **DEAP1** mutants.
   - Moreover, **DEAP1** may interact with two rice D6 PROTEIN KINASE-LIKE3s (OsD6PKL3s), homologs of a known Arabidopsis aperture protein, to affect rice pollen aperture development.
   - Our findings suggested that **DEAP1** is involved in male reproductive development and may affect exine formation and aperture patterning, thereby providing new insights into the molecular functions of plant FLAs in male fertility.
   - **DEAP1** encodes a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein required for male fertility in rice.
   - The **DEAP1** mutant anthers produced aberrant pollen grains with defective exine formation and a flattened aperture annulus and exhibited slightly delayed tapetum degradation.
