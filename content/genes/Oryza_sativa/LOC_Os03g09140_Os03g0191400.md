## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results may suggest that **OsRab6a** plays an important role in the regulation of Fe acquisition in rice plants by modulating physiological processes involved in Fe acquisition and root system architecture in response to Fe-deficient medium.
   - However, overexpression of **OsRab6a** conferred rice plants greater tolerance to Fe deficiency than RNAi and wild-type plants, as evidenced by higher seedling height, greater biomass, chlorophyll contents and Fe concentrations in shoots, roots and grains in the overexpression lines.
   - **OsRab6a** shared conserved functional domains with other known members of Rab subfamily and localized ubiquitously in the cytoplasm and nuclear.
   - Here, we report that the **OsRab6a** gene encoding a small GTPase is involved in the regulation of rice growth, seed yield and iron (Fe) accumulation in response to elevated [CO2] using wild-type and transgenic rice plants of **OsRab6a**-overexpressing and **OsRab6a**-RNAi.
   - By analyzing data with the Dunnett's multiple comparison test, our results suggest that **OsRab6a** is an important molecular regulator underlying rice adaptation to elevated [CO2] by regulating photosynthesis and Fe accumulation.
