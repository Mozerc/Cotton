- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsNHAD** is a chloroplast membrane-located transporter required for resistance to salt stress in rice (Oryza sativa)..
   - Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of **OsNHAD**::GFP fusion in tobacco leaves shows that **OsNHAD** resides in the chloroplast envelop.
   - Knock-down of **OsNHAD** by RNA interference led to increased rice sensitivity to Na+, manifested by stunted plant growth, enhanced cellular damage, reduced PSII activity and changed chloroplast morphology.
   - Complementation test reveals that **OsNHAD** was able to functionally restore the Arabidopsis mutant atnhd1-1 growth phenotype.
   - These results suggest that **OsNHAD** possibly mediates homeostasis of sodium ions in the subcellular compartments and tissues of the plants when challenged to salt stress.
   - **OsNHAD** transcripts mainly express in leaves and are induced by Na+ stress.
   - In this study, we functionally identified an uncharacterized sodium ion transporter named **OsNHAD** which encodes a putative Na+ <U+2044> H+ antiporter in rice.
