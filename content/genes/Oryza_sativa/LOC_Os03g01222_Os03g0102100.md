## Functional Descriptions:
   - In a further feeding assay with exogenous glutathione (GSH), a non-enzymatic antioxidant that consumes H2O2, the H2O2 accumulation and leaf senescence phenotypes of **HPA1** were obviously compensated.
   - Taken together, our findings suggest that the accumulation of H2O2 in **HPA1** may be mediated by an altered folate status and redox homeostasis, subsequently triggering leaf senescence.
   - Proteomics and enzyme activity analyses further revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation complex I and complex V were differentially expressed in **HPA1**, which was consistent with the H2O2 accumulation in **HPA1**.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **HPA1** encodes a tetrahydrofolate deformylase, and its deficiency led to the accumulation of tetrahydrofolate, 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate and 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate, in contrast, a decrease in 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate.
