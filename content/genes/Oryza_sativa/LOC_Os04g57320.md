## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os04g57320](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g57320)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0668900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0668900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsIM1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Sequence analysis revealed that the amino-acid sequence of **OsIM1** showed 66% and 62% identity with PTOX from tomato ( Capsicum annuum) and AtIM from Arabidopsis, both of which encoded chloroplast-orientated terminal oxidase.
   - The Northern blot revealed that **OsIM1** was up-regulated by NaCl and ABA treatment.
   - RT-PCR analysis indicated that **OsIM1** and OsIM2 co-existed in the OsIM transcript pool, and the ratio of **OsIM1**/ OsIM2 was differentially regulated by salt stress in the salt-sensitive variety and the salt-tolerant varieties.
   - A new AOX homologous gene **OsIM1** from rice (Oryza sativa L.) with an alternative splicing mechanism under salt stress.
   - A differentially expressed **OsIM1** gene was isolated from rice salt-tolerant mutant M-20 by differential display.
