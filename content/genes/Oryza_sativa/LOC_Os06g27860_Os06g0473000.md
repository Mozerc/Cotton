## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsPHS1** is required for both male and female gamete development in rice..
   - Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that the **OsPHS1** protein is situated in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
   - Expression pattern analysis indicated that **OsPHS1** expression levels were mainly expressed in panicles at the beginning of meiosis.
   - Taken together, our results suggest an important role for **OsPHS1** in homologous chromosome pairing in both male and female gametogenesis in rice.
