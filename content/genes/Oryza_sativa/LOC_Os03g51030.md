## Functional Descriptions:
   - ACO1 expression was controlled mainly by **PHYA** and phyB, and a histochemical analysis showed that ACO1 expression was localized to the basal parts of leaf sheaths of **PHYA**phyBphyC seedlings, similar to mature wild-type plants at the heading stage, when internode elongation was greatly promoted.
   - Rice is a short-day plant, and we found that mutation in either phyB or phyC caused moderate early flowering under the long-day photoperiod, while monogenic **PHYA** mutation had little effect on the flowering time.
   - The **PHYA** mutation, however, in combination with phyB or phyC mutation caused dramatic early flowering.
   - The seedlings of **PHYA** mutants grown in continuous far-red light showed essentially the same phenotype as dark-grown seedlings, indicating the insensitivity of **PHYA** mutants to far-red light.
   - The etiolated seedlings of **PHYA** mutants also were insensitive to a pulse of far-red light or very low fluence red light.
   - Interestingly, continuous far-red light induced the expression of CAB and RBCS genes in rice **PHYA** seedlings, suggesting the existence of a photoreceptor(s) other than **PHYA** that can perceive continuous far-red light in the etiolated seedlings.
   - However, hypocotyl elongation experiments revealed that transgenic seedlings expressing S/A **PHYA** showed a higher amplitude of the red light response with respect to the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation.
   - In addition, the transcription levels of several ethylene- or gibberellin (GA)-related genes were changed in **PHYA**phyBphyC mutants, and measurement of the plant hormone levels indicated low ethylene production and bioactive GA levels in the **PHYA**phyBphyC mutants.
   - The metabolite profiles indicated high accumulation of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar phosphates, and nucleotides in the leaf blades of **PHYA** phyB phyC triple mutants, especially in the young leaves, compared with those in the WT.
   - A gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1), which is an ethylene biosynthesis gene contributing to internode elongation, was up-regulated in **PHYA**phyBphyC seedlings.
   - We demonstrate that ethylene induced internode elongation and ACO1 expression in **PHYA**phyBphyC seedlings but not in the wild type and that the presence of bioactive GAs was necessary for these effects.
   - Moreover, phyB and **PHYA** can affect Ghd7 activity and Early heading date1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively.
   - Although **PHYA**phyBphyC phytochrome-null mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) have morphological changes and exhibit internode elongation, even as seedlings, it is unknown how phytochromes contribute to the control of internode elongation.
   - Transgenic tobacco plants expressing either wild-type or S/A **PHYA** showed similar phenotypic alterations, including dwarfism and dark-green leaves.
   - Distinct metabolic profiles between **PHYA** phyB phyC triple mutants and the wild type (WT), as well as those between young and mature leaf blades, could be clearly observed by principal component analysis (PCA).
   - **OsPhyA** modulates rice flowering time mainly through OsGI under short days and Ghd7 under long days in the absence of phytochrome B.
   - These results indicated that **OsPhyA** influences flowering time mainly by affecting the expression of OsGI under SD and Ghd7 under LD when phytochrome B is absent.
   - We also demonstrated that far-red light delays flowering time via both **OsPhyA** and OsPhyB.
