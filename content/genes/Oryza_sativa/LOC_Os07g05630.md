## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g05630](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g05630)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0151100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0151100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsGRX19</u>&nbsp;<u>MIL1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, analysis of **MIL1** msp1 double mutants reveals that due to the absence of **MIL1**, the cells in their anther locule center do not activate meiotic cell cycle either, generating a similar anther phenotype to **MIL1**.
   - We show here that plant pollen mother cells contain a specific meiosis initiation machinery through characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) gene, MICROSPORELESS1 (**MIL1**).
   - The **MIL1** mutant does not produce microspores in anthers but has the normal female fertility.
   - Detailed molecular and cytological investigations demonstrate that **MIL1** anthers are defective in the meiotic entry of sporogenous cell progenies and in the differentiation of surrounding somatic cell layers, resulting in locules filled with somatic cells instead of microspores.
   - These results suggest meiotic entry in microsporocytes is directed by an anther-specific mechanism, which requires **MIL1** activity, and redox regulation might play important roles in this process.
   - **MIL1** encodes a plant-specific CC-type glutaredoxin, which could interact with TGA transcription factors.
