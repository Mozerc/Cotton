- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Subtractive screening of cDNA that accumulated in 12 degrees C-treated anthers identified a cDNA clone, **OsMEK1**, encoding a protein with features characteristic of a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase.
   - **OsMEK1** transcript levels were induced in rice anthers by 12 degrees C treatment for 48 h.
   - Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that at least two signaling pathways for low temperature stress exist in rice, and that a MAP kinase pathway with **OsMEK1** and OsMAP1 components is possibly involved in the signaling for the higher range low-temperature stress.
   - Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, **OsMEK1** and OsMAP1, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice.
   - Taken together, our data suggest that **OsMKK6** and OsMPK3 constitute a moderately low-temperature signalling pathway and regulate cold stress tolerance in rice.
   - In the present study, a MKK from rice (Oryza sativa), **OsMKK6** was functionally characterized in salt stress by transforming its constitutively active form.
   - CONCLUSION: Present work suggest role of **OsMKK6** gene in salt stress signaling in rice.
   - Similar **OsMEK1** induction was observed in shoots and roots of seedlings that were treated at 12 degrees C for up to 24 h.
   - It is interesting that no induction of **OsMEK1** transcripts was observed in 4 degrees C-treated seedlings.
   - Enhanced chilling tolerance was observed in the transgenic plants overexpressing **OsMKK6**DD.
   - Biochemical identification of the **OsMKK6**-OsMPK3 signalling pathway for chilling stress tolerance in rice.
