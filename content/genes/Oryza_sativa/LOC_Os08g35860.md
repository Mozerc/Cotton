- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase **OsCKX11** coordinates source and sink relationship in rice by simultaneous regulation of leaf senescence and grain number.
   - ) cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase **OsCKX11** in delaying leaf senescence, increasing grain number, and coordinately regulating source and sink.
   - **OsCKX11** was predominantly expressed in the roots, leaves, and panicles and was strongly induced by abscisic acid and leaf senescence.
   - Thus, **OsCKX11** functions antagonistically between cytokinins and ABA in leaf senescence.
   - Collectively, our findings reveal that **OsCKX11** simultaneously regulates photosynthesis and grain number, which may provide new insights into leaf senescence and crop molecular breeding.
   - Moreover, **OsCKX11** presented with significantly increased branch, tiller, and grain number compared with the WT.
   - In the **OsCKX11** mutant, the ABA-biosynthesizing genes were down-regulated and the ABA-degrading genes were up-regulated, thereby reducing the ABA levels relative to the WT.
   - Cytokinin levels were significantly increased in the flag leaves of **OsCKX11** mutant compared to those of the wild type (WT).
