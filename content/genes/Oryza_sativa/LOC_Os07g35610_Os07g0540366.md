## Functional Descriptions:
   - Mutants defective in **DTC1** exhibit phenotypes of an enlarged tapetum and middle layer with delayed degeneration, causing male sterility.
   - Whereas wild-type plants accumulate large amounts of ROS in their anthers at Stage 9 of development, those levels remain low during all stages of development in **DTC1** anthers.
   - These results suggest that **DTC1** functions downstream of those transcription factor genes and upstream of the genes encoding secretory proteins.
   - These findings indicate that **DTC1** is a key regulator for tapetum PCD by inhibiting ROS-scavenging activity.
   - In **DTC1** anthers, expression of genes encoding secretory proteases or lipid transporters is significantly reduced, while transcripts of PCD regulatory genes, e.
