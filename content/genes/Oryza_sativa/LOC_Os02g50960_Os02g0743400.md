## Functional Descriptions:
   - Adventitious root emergence and development were significantly inhibited in the **OsPIN1** RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants, which was similar to the phenotype of NPA (N-1-naphthylphalamic acid, an auxin-transport inhibitor)-treated wild-type plants.
   - Taken together, these data suggest that **OsPIN1** plays an important role in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering.
   - A PIN1 family gene, **OsPIN1**, involved in auxin-dependent adventitious root emergence and tillering in rice.
   - **OsPIN1** was expressed in the vascular tissues and root primordial in a manner similar to AtPIN1.
   - Overexpression or suppression of the **OsPIN1** expression through a transgenic approach resulted in changes of tiller numbers and shoot/root ratio.
   - **REH1**, a rice EIR1 (Arabidopsis ethylene insensitive root 1)-like gene, is a putative auxin efflux carrier.
   - These data suggest that OsPIN1a and **OsPIN1b** are involved in root, shoot and inflorescence development in rice, whereas OsPIN1c and OsPIN1d mainly function in panicle formation.
   - Mutation of **OsPIN1b** resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes, including decreased growth of shoots and primary roots, reduced adventitious root number in rice seedlings, as well as shorter and narrower leaves, increased leaf angle, more tiller number and decreased plant height and panicle length at the late developmental stage.
   - Mutation of **OsPIN1b** by CRISPR/Cas9 Reveals a Role for Auxin Transport in Modulating Rice Architecture and Root Gravitropism..
   - In the present study, **OsPIN1b** was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and its roles in modulating rice architecture and root gravitropism were investigated.
   - IAA homeostasis was disturbed in **OsPIN1b** mutants, as evidenced by the changed sensitivity of shoot and root to NAA and NPA treatment, respectively.
   - Moreover, **OsPIN1b** mutants displayed a curly root phenotype cultured with tap water regardless of lighting conditions, while nutrient solution culture could partially rescue the curly root phenotype in light and almost completely abolish this phenotype in darkness, indicating the involvement of the integration of light and nutrient signals in root gravitropism regulation.
   - Additionally, amyloplast sedimentation was impaired in the peripheral tiers of the **OsPIN1b** root cap columella cell, while it was not the main contributor to the abnormal root gravitropism.
   - These data suggest that **OsPIN1b** not only plays a vital role in regulating rice architecture but also functions in regulating root gravitropism by the integration of light and nutrient signals.
   - Tissue-specific analysis showed that **OsPIN1b** was mainly expressed in roots, stems and sheaths at the seedling stage, and the transcript abundance was progressively decreased during the seedling stages.
   - Here, we reveal a novel regulator of leaf inclination, auxin transporter **OsPIN1b**.
   - The **OsPIN1b** was localized on the plasma membrane, and the free IAA contents in the lamina joint of **OsPIN1b** mutants were significantly increased while they were decreased in OE-**OsPIN1b** lines, suggesting that **OsPIN1b** might action an auxin transporter such as AtPIN1 to alter IAA content and leaf inclination.
   - Furthermore, the **OsPIN1b** expression was induced by exogenous epibrassinolide (24-eBL) and IAA, and **OsPIN1b** mutants are insensitive to BR or IAA treatment, indicating that the effecting leaf inclination is regulated by **OsPIN1b**.
