## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os08g04790](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os08g04790)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0143500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0143500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsGT14;1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsGT14;1** was broadly expressed in all organs throughout the entire growth period, with a relatively high expression in the roots, stems, nodeâ€‰I and husk.
   - Taken together, **OsGT14;1** located at the Golgi is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice through affecting cellulose synthesis.
   - The knockout of **OsGT14;1** did not affect the tolerance to toxic mineral elements, including Al, As, Cd and salt stress, but did increase the sensitivity to low pH.
   - Mutation of **OsGT14;1** resulted in decreased cellulose content and increased hemicellulose, but did not alter pectin in the cell wall of roots and shoots.
   - A Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase, **OsGT14;1**, is required for growth of both roots and shoots in rice.
