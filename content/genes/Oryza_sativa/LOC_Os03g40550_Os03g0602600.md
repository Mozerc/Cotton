## Functional Descriptions:
   - Map-based cloning revealed that HSA1 encodes a putative **OsFLN2**.
   - The **HSA1** mutant harbors a recessive mutation in a gene encoding fructokinase-like protein2 (FLN2); the mutation causes a premature stop codon and results in a severe albino phenotype, with defects in early chloroplast development.
   - The color of **HSA1** mutant plants gradually changed from albino to green at later stages of development at various temperatures and chloroplast biogenesis was strongly delayed at high temperature (32<U+202F><a1><e3>C).
   - **HSA1** localizes to the chloroplast and regulates chloroplast development.
   - These results demonstrated that **HSA1** plays important roles in chloroplast development at early stages, and functions in protecting chloroplasts under heat stress at later stages in rice.
   - **GRA117** encodes PfkB-type fructokinase-like 2, which is subcellularly localized in chloroplasts and is widely expressed in various rice tissues, particularly at high levels in leaf tissues.
   - RNA-Seq analysis revealed that **GRA117** plays a significant role in photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon metabolism, and chloroplast ribosome-related pathways.
   - Our study supports that **GRA117** promotes the Calvin-Benson cycle by regulating chloroplast development, ultimately leading to enhanced carbon assimilation in rice.
   - **GRA117** is crucial in the process of carbon assimilation in rice as it regulates the development of chloroplasts, which in turn facilitates the Calvin-Benson cycle.
