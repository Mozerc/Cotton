## Functional Descriptions:
   - Differential screening of a cDNA library constructed using poly(A)(+) RNA from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with jasmonic acid (JA) for 1/2h yielded a cDNA of a gene tentatively named **RERJ1** that is upregulated in response to exogenous JA.
   - Northern blot analysis indicated that the **RERJ1** mRNA levels peaked at 1/2-1h after the addition of jasmonic acid and then decreased gradually.
   - **RERJ1**, a jasmonic acid-responsive gene from rice, encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein.
   - We previously reported that **RERJ1**, a JA-inducible transcription factor in rice, is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress.
   - **RERJ1** expression was induced only at the region of injury after wounding, whereas expression was induced in the entire leaf after drought.
   - According to JA measurements of stressed leaves, high accumulation of endogenous JA was only detected around the wound site in a rice leaves, whereas the drought treatment led to uniform accumulation of JA in the entire leaf, suggesting that **RERJ1** will be a useful marker gene for studies on localization of JA in rice.
   - Stress-induced expression of the transcription factor **RERJ1** is tightly regulated in response to jasmonic acid accumulation in rice.
   - The jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene **RERJ1** isolated from suspension-cultured rice cells encodes a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix motif.
   - The phenotypes of transgenic rice plants overexpressing sense or antisense **RERJ1** mRNA demonstrated that **RERJ1** is involved in the growth inhibition of rice shoots caused by JA.
   - It is also suggested that JA but not abscisic acid is involved in the up-regulation of **RERJ1** expression caused by wounding and drought stress.
   - These results suggest that **RERJ1** plays a role as a transcriptional activator for regulating stress-inducible gene expression, with a strong correlation to JA accumulation in the stressed region.
   - In this study, we found that **RERJ1** is also expressed in rice plants in response to JA, and that its expression in rice leaves is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress.
   - Involvement of the Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor **RERJ1** in Wounding and Drought Stress Responses in Rice Plants.
   - Our data suggest that **OsbHLH6** controls disease resistance by dynamically regulating SA and JA signaling.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsbHLH6** display increased JA responsive gene expression and enhanced disease susceptibility to the pathogen.
   - Nucleus-localized **OsbHLH6** activates JA signaling and suppresses SA signaling; however, the SA regulator OsNPR1 (Nonexpressor of PR genes 1) sequesters **OsbHLH6** in the cytosol to alleviate its effect.
   - **OsbHLH6** expression was upregulated during Magnaporthe oryzae infection.
