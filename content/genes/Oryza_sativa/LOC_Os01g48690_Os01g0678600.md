## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g48690](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g48690)  &nbsp;,&nbsp; [Os01g0678600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0678600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** ASL1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **ASL1** encodes PRP S20 (PRPS20), which localizes to the chloroplast.
   - The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in **ASL1** mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable.
   - This study identifies the first rice PRP mutant, **ASL1** (albino seedling lethality1), which exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage.
   - **ASL1** showed tissue-specific expression, as it was highly expressed in plumule and young seedlings but expressed at much lower levels in other tissues.
