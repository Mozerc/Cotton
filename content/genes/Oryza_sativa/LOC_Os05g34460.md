- **Gene Symbol:** TCM5
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we reported the first rice deg mutant **TCM5** (thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 5) that has an albino phenotype, defective chloroplasts and could not survive after the 4-5 leaf seedling stage when grown at high temperature (32 °C).
   - The **TCM5** encodes chloroplast-targeted Deg protease protein which is important for chloroplast development and the maintenance of PSII function and its disruption would lead to a defective chloroplast and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis at early rice seedling stage under high temperatures.
   - The Rice **TCM5** Gene Encoding a Novel Deg Protease Protein is Essential for Chloroplast Development under High Temperatures.
   - In **TCM5** mutants grown at high temperatures, the transcript levels of certain genes associated with chloroplast development especially PSII-associated genes were severely affected, but recovered to normal levels at low temperatures.
   - These results showed important role of **TCM5** for chloroplast development under high temperatures.
   - Map-based cloning showed that **TCM5** encoding a chloroplast-targeted Deg protease protein.
