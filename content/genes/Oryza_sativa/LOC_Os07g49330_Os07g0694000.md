## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g49330](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g49330)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0694000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0694000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsPLC1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Salt stress induced the recruitment of **OsPLC1** from cytoplasm to plasma membrane, where it hydrolyzed PtdIns4P.
   - In addition, the enlargement of grain size was observed in OE plants, however, the reduction of grain size was noticed in **OsPLC1** mutants.
   - The increase in the grain size and the grain yield of OE lines were associated with the improvement of cell length and expression levels of a set of genes related to cell expansion, contrarily, the decrease in **OsPLC1** mutant grain size and yield were linked to declined cell length and expression levels of related genes.
   - No significant differences, in terms of the grain quality of mature seeds, were found in OE and **OsPLC1** mutants, with compared to those in Nipponbare (Nip).
   - In summary, our study suggests that **OsPLC1** could modulate rice flowering time and grain size.
   - Preferential expression of **OsPLC1** is detected at the heading stage of rice, **OsPLC1** overexpression results in early flowering, increased-grain size and yield; however, opposing phenotypes produced in the **OsPLC1** mutants.
   - The expression levels of subset genes, which are involved in the control of flowering time in rice, were altered in the plants of OE and **OsPLC1**.
   - **OsPLC1** overexpression (OE) produced rice plants with early flowering, whereas **OsPLC1** loss-of-function led to delay in flowering.
