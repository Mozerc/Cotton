- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **CUR1** mutant displayed a heteroblastic change, whereby the mutant leaf phenotype appeared specifically at a later adult phase of vegetative development.
   - The shoot apical meristem (SAM) was small and the leaf initiation rate was low, suggesting that the activity of the SAM seemed to be partially reduced in **CUR1**.
   - Transcriptome analysis showed that genes involved in protein quality control were highly upregulated in the **CUR1** shoot apex at the later vegetative phase, suggesting the restoration of impaired proteins probably produced by partial defects in translational control due to the loss of function of Elongator.
   - The differences in the mutant phenotype and gene expression profile between **CUR1** and its Arabidopsis ortholog suggest that Elongator has evolved to play a unique role in rice development.
