## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptional profiling and promoter analysis revealed that **OsNF-YB1** was highly expressed at the early stages of rice endosperm development (5-7 DAP, days after pollination).
   - Repression of **OsNF-YB1** resulted in differential expression of the genes in cell cycle pathway, which caused abnormal seeds with defected embryo and endosperm.
   - Basic cytological analysis demonstrated that the reduced endosperm cell numbers disintegrated with the development of those abnormal seeds in **OsNF-YB1** RNAi plants.
   - Taken together, these results suggested that the endosperm-specific gene **OsNF-YB1** might be a cell cycle regulator and played a role in maintaining the endosperm cell proliferation.
   - NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm.
   - Rice aleurone layer specific **OsNF-YB1** regulates grain filling and endosperm development by interacting with an ERF transcription factor.
   - Knockdown of **OsNF-YB1** expression by RNAi significantly retarded grain filling, leading to small grains with chalky endosperm as well as altered starch quality.
   - RNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to membrane transport and ATP biosynthesis were enriched in the down-regulated category in **OsNF-YB1** RNAi plants, which is consistent with the crucial role of **OsNF-YB1** in rice grain filling and endosperm development.
   - It is proposed that **OsNF-YB1** specifically regulate the transcription of downstream genes during rice endosperm development by forming protein complexes consisting of **OsNF-YB1**, OsNF-YC and ERF, providing informative insights into the molecular functional mechanisms of the NF-Y factor.
   - Interestingly, different from the binding sites reported for other NF-Y complexes, the GCC box, the binding motif of ERF transcription factors, was enriched in the binding peaks of **OsNF-YB1**.
   - Whereas **OsNF-YB1** shows subcellular localization in both the cytosol and the nucleus in roots, it was specifically targeted to the nucleus of aleurone layer cells, which was facilitated by interacting with OsNF-YC proteins preferentially expressed in the aleurone layer.
   - Identification of the genome-wide targets of **OsNF-YB1** by ChIP sequencing showed that **OsNF-YB1** directly regulates genes involved in the transport of nutrients such as sugar and amino acids.
   - Seeds of **OsNF-YB1** and osbzip76 mutants showed reduced size and reduced apparent amylose content.
   - Suppression of RGB1 expression also resulted in the lower auxin content in grains, which was correlated with the lower expression of **OsNF-YB1** and OsYUC11 during grain filling stage.
