## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g35970](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g35970)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0568200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0568200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CPT1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - However, no asymmetry was induced in **CPT1** coleoptiles, indicating that lateral translocation of auxin occurs downstream of **CPT1**.
   - It is concluded that the **CPT1**-dependent major phototropism of coleoptiles is achieved by lateral auxin translocation and subsequent growth redistribution.
   - In an extended study with the **CPT1** mutant, it was found that phototropic differential growth is accompanied by a **CPT1**-independent inhibition of net growth.
   - This response, induced only transiently, was thought to be caused by the **CPT1**-independent growth inhibition.
