## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g40020](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g40020)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0597200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0597200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>YSA</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We showed that the **YSA** mutation has no apparent negative effects on several important agronomic traits, such as fertility, stigma extrusion rate, selfed seed-setting rate, hybrid seed-setting rate, and yield heterosis under normal growth conditions.
   - Here we report a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant named young seedling albino (**YSA**) derived from the rice thermo/photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile line Pei'ai64S, which is a leading male-sterile line for commercial two-line hybrid rice production.
   - The **YSA** mutant develops albino leaves before the three-leaf stage, but the mutant gradually turns green and recovers to normal green at the six-leaf stage.
   - Further investigation showed that the change in leaf color in **YSA** mutant is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development.
   - We further demonstrated that **YSA** can be used as an early marker for efficient identification and elimination of false hybrids in commercial hybrid rice production, resulting in yield increases by up to approximately 537 kg ha(-1).
   - **YSA** is highly expressed in young leaves and stems, and its expression level is regulated by light.
