## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we report a role of **OsDEX1** (Defective in Exine Formation 1 in rice), a Ca2+ binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation.
   - In **OsDEX1** anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility.
   - Phylogenetic analysis revealed that **OsDEX1** may have a conserved function in binding Ca2+ in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects in an Arabidopsis dex1 mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation during pollen development.
   - Collectively, these findings suggest that **OsDEX1** plays a conserved role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via changing the Ca2+ homeostasis during pollen development.
   - **OsDEX1** transcript is observed in tapetal cells and microspores during the early anther development.
   - Recombinant **OsDEX1** is able to bind Ca2+ and regulate Ca2+ homeostasis in vitro, and **OsDEX1** showed disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis in tapetal cells.
