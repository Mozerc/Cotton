## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knocking out **OsZIP11** by CRISPR-Cas9 approach led to the attenuated rice growth and physiological phenotypes, depicting shorter plant height, reduced biomass, chlorosis (a symptom of lower chlorophyll concentration), and over-accumulation of malondialdehyde (complex representing the peroxidation of membrane lipids) in rice plantlets.
   - Our work pointed out that **OsZIP11** is required for iron acquisition for rice growth and development.
   - **OsZIP11** was preferentially expressed in the rice tissues (or organs) at later flowering and seed development stages.
   - The field trials demonstrated that **OsZIP11** mutation impaired the capacity of seed development, with shortened panicle and seed length, compromised spikelet fertility, and reduced grain per plant or 1000-grain weight.
   - **OsZIP11** is a trans-Golgi-residing transporter required for rice iron accumulation and development.
   - Whether the rice ZRT/IRT-like protein family metal transporter **OsZIP11** is involved in Fe transport has not been functionally defined.
   - Transcripts of **OsZIP11** were significantly induced under Fe but not under zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) or manganese (Mn) deficiency.
   - The objective of the study is to figure out the essential role of the uncharacterized **OsZIP11** played in rice growth, development, and iron accumulation, particularly in seeds.
   - Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) transformed with **OsZIP11** sequences displayed an active iron input which turned out that excessive iron accumulated in the cells.
   - Knocking out **OsZIP11** also lowered the accumulation of iron in the brown rice by 48-51% compared to the wild-type.
