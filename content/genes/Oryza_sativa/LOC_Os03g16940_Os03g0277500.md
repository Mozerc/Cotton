## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our previous study suggested that **OsGLYI3** may be effective in seed natural aging.
   - In this study, the rice **OsGLYI3** gene was cloned and characterized as specifically expressed in the seed.
   - The accelerated aging (AA) treatment results indicated significant roles of **OsGLYI3** in seed longevity and vigor, as the seeds of the transgenic lines with overexpressed and knocked-out **OsGLYI3** exhibited higher and lower germination, respectively.
   - Collectively, our results confirmed for the first time that **OsGLYI3** is specifically expressed in rice seeds and contributes to seed longevity and salt stress tolerance.
   - Rice **OsGLYI3** was markedly upregulated in response to NaCl induced stress conditions.
