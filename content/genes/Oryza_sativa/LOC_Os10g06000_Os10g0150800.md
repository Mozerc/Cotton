## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g06000](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g06000)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0150800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0150800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsPRP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsPRP1** mutant plants displayed more sensitivity to cold stress and showed low survival rate with decreased root biomass than wild-type (WT) and homozygous mutant line with large fragment deletion was more sensitive to low temperature.
   - These results suggested that **OsPRP1** enhances cold tolerance by modulating antioxidants and maintaining cross talk through signaling pathways.
   - Therefore, **OsPRP1** gene could be exploited for improving cold tolerance in rice and CRISPR/Cas9 technology is helpful to study the function of a gene by analyzing the phenotypes of knockout mutants generated.
   - Mutant plants were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 technology to investigate the role of **OsPRP1** in cold stress and 26 mutant plants were obtained in T0 generation with the mutation rate of 85% including 15% bi-allelic, 53.
