## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (**TDR**).
   - While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in **TDR** and udt1-1, and no apparent expression fold change of UDT1 in **TDR** and gamyb-4, suggesting that **TDR** may act downstream of GAMYB and UDT1, and GAMYB and UDT1 work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development.
   - The expression levels of Osc6, OsRAFTIN and **TDR**, which are tapetum-specific genes, were unaffected by high temperatures.
   - These results revealed that the expression of **TDR** (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and udt1 (undeveloped tapetum1).
   - Here, we report on the function of the rice tapetum-expressing **TDR** (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) gene in aliphatic metabolism and its regulatory role during rice pollen development.
   - The observations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggested that pollen wall formation was significantly altered in the **TDR** mutant.
   - Microarray data revealed that a group of genes putatively involved in lipid transport and metabolism were significantly altered in the **TDR** mutant, indicating the critical role of **TDR** in the formation of the pollen wall.
   - In addition to its function in promoting tapetum PCD, **TDR** possibly plays crucial regulatory roles in several basic biological processes during rice pollen development.
   - The contents of aliphatic compositions of anther were greatly changed in the **TDR** mutant revealed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) testing, particularly less accumulated in fatty acids, primary alcohols, alkanes and alkenes, and an abnormal increase in secondary alcohols with carbon lengths from C29 to C35 in **TDR**.
   - Extra granule-like structures were observed on the inner surface of the **TDR** tapetal layer when the expression of OsC6 was driven by the **TDR** promoter compared with the **TDR** mutant.
   - We report the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male sterile mutant tapetum degeneration retardation (**TDR**), which exhibits degeneration retardation of the tapetum and middle layer as well as collapse of microspores.
   - The **TDR** gene is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix protein, which is likely localized to the nucleus.
   - These results indicate that **TDR** is a key component of the molecular network regulating rice tapetum development and degeneration.
   - In addition, we uncover a possible mechanism by which GA regulates male fertility: SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) interacts with and sequesters two critical transcription factors for tapetum development, UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (UDT1), and TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION (**TDR**), and GA alleviates the sequestration by SLR1, thus allowing UDT1 and **TDR** to activate transcription.
