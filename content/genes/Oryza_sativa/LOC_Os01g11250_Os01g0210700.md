## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we report the characterization of two inward rectifying shaker-like potassium channels, **OsKAT2** and OsKAT3, expressed in guard cell of rice plants.
   - While **OsKAT2** showed typical potassium channel activity, like that of Arabidopsis KAT1, OsKAT3 did not despite high sequence similarity between the two channel proteins.
   - Interestingly, the two potassium channels physically interacted with each other and such interaction negatively regulated the **OsKAT2** channel activity in CHO cell system.
   - Unique features of two potassium channels, **OsKAT2** and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells.
   - Interestingly, overexpression of **OsKAT2**(T235R) did not cause serious defects in growth or yield in rice, suggesting that **OsKAT2** is a potential target for engineering plants with improved drought tolerance without yield penalty.
   - A Dominant Negative **OsKAT2** Mutant Delays Light-Induced Stomatal Opening and Improves Drought Tolerance without Yield Penalty in Rice..
   - Our results indicate that **OsKAT2** is an inward- rectifying shaker-like potassium channel that mainly functions in stomatal opening.
   - Here, we investigated the functions of **OsKAT2** in stomatal regulation using three dominant negative mutant proteins, **OsKAT2**(T235R), **OsKAT2**(T285A) and **OsKAT2**(T285D), which are altered in amino acids in the channel pore and at a phosphorylation site.
   - In the present study, we found that the repression of OsAKTs, **OsKAT2**, and **OsKAT2** in roots was related to salinity tolerance in rice.
