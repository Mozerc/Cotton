## Functional Descriptions:
   - A comparative phosphoproteomic approach led to the identification of six potential in vivo **OsCPK17** targets, which are associated with sugar and nitrogen metabolism, and with osmotic regulation.
   - Here we test the hypothesis that **OsCPK17** plays a role in rice cold stress response by analyzing **OsCPK17** knockout, silencing, and overexpressing rice lines under low temperature.
   - Altered **OsCPK17** gene expression compromises cold tolerance performance, without affecting the expression of key cold stress-inducible genes.
   - \Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase **OsCPK17** targets plasma membrane intrinsic protein and sucrose phosphate synthase and is required for a proper cold stress response..
   - Altogether, our data indicates that **OsCPK17** is required for a proper cold stress response in rice, likely affecting the activity of membrane channels and sugar metabolism.
   - To test direct interaction, in vitro kinase assays were performed, showing that the sucrose phosphate synthase OsSPS4, and the aquaporin OsPIP2;1/OsPIP2;6 are phosphorylated by **OsCPK17** in a calcium-dependent manner.
   - The rice cold-responsive calcium-dependent protein kinase **OsCPK17** is regulated by alternative splicing and post-translational modifications..
   - Our analysis indicated that **OsCPK17** activity depends on its structural rearrangement induced by calcium binding, and that the protein can be autophosphorylated.
