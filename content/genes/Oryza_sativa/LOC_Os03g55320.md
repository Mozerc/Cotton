## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **OsBIERF1**, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice.
   - We isolated and identified four rice genes, **OsBIERF1** to OsBIERF4 (Oryza sativa benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced ethylene responsive transcriptional factors (ERF)) and analyzed their expressions in rice disease resistance response and under various abiotic stress conditions.
   - In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of **OsBIERF1**, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings.
   - Moreover, **OsBIERF1**, OsBIERF3 and OsBIERF4 were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding.
   - Overall, the present results indicated that **OsPP2C34** is involved in<a6><c1>-amylase expression of GA signal transduction pathway.
