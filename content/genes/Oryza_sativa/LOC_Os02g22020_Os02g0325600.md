## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, the chlorophyll content that could be a marker of nitrogen utilization was found to be decreased in **NIGT1** overexpressors of rice grown with nitrate medium but not with ammonium medium.
   - Thus, we propose **NIGT1** as a nitrate-inducible and autorepressible transcriptional repressor that may play a role in the nitrogen response in rice.
   - Here we show that the supply of nitrate but not ammonium immediately induces the expression of a transcriptional repressor gene in rice, designated **NIGT1** (Nitrate-Inducible, GARP-type Transcriptional Repressor 1).
   - Consistently, nitrate-induced **NIGT1** expression was found to be down-regulated after a transient peak during nitrate treatment, and the nitrate-induced expression of **NIGT1** decreased in transgenic rice plants in which this gene was constitutively overexpressed.
   - Taken together with the fact that the **NIGT1**-binding sites are conserved in promoter sequences of Arabidopsis **NIGT1** homologs, our findings imply the presence of a time-dependent complex system for nitrate-responsive transcriptional regulation that is conserved in both monocots and dicots.
   - Here we show that a Pi-starvation induced transcription factor **NIGT1** (NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1) controls plant growth and prevents a hyperresponse to Pi-starvation by directly repressing the expression of growth-related and Pi-signaling genes to achieve a balance between growth and response under a varying Pi environment.
   - **NIGT1** represses plant growth and mitigates phosphate starvation signaling to balance the growth response tradeoff in rice..
   - We further demonstrate that **NIGT1** constrains shoot growth by repressing the expression of growth-related regulatory genes, including brassinolide signal transduction master regulator BZR1, cell division regulator CYCB1;1, and DNA replication regulator PSF3.
   - Our findings reveal the function of **NIGT1** in orchestrating plant growth and Pi-starvation signaling, and also provide evidence that **NIGT1** acts as a safeguard to avoid hyperresponse during Pi-starvation stress in rice.
