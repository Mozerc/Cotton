- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The multiple roles of **OsmiR535** in modulating plant height, panicle branching and grain shape.
   - Furthermore, **OsmiR535** overexpression imposed great influence in panicle architecture, such as more but shorter panicles, and fewer primary/secondary panicle branches.
   - Through quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we further revealed that **OsmiR535** overexpression repressed the expression of OsSPL7/12/16, as well as the OsSPLs downstream panicle related genes, including OsPIN1B, OsDEP1, OsLOG and OsSLR1.
   - Taken together, our findings suggest that **OsmiR535** multiply modulates plant height, panicle architecture and grain shape possibly by regulating OsSPLs genes in rice.
   - Moreover, **OsmiR535** overexpression increased the grain length, but did not affect grain width.
   - Expectedly, **OsmiR535** overexpression in rice reduced plant height by decreasing the 1st and 2nd internode length.
   - In addition, the overexpression of **OsmiR535** significantly reduced the survival rate of rice seedlings during PEG and dehydration post-stress recovery.
   - **OsmiR535** is involved in regulating the cold-stress response, modulating plant development, and determining panicle architecture and grain length.
   - However, the role that **OsmiR535** plays in plant responses to drought and salinity are elusive.
   - Moreover, our practical application of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing created a homozygous 5 bp deletion in the coding sequence of **OsmiR535**, demonstrating that **OsmiR535** could be a useful genetic editing target for drought and salinity tolerance and a new marker for molecular breeding of Oryza sativa.
   - With transgenic and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout system techniques, our results verified that either inhibition or knockout of **OsmiR535** in rice could enhance the tolerance of plants to NaCl, ABA, dehydration and PEG stresses.
   - In the current study, molecular and genetic engineering techniques were used to elucidate the possible role of **OsmiR535** in response to NaCl, PEG(Poly ethylene glycol), ABA(Abscisic acid), and dehydration stresses.
   - Our results demonstrated that **OsmiR535** negatively regulates the stress response in rice.
   - Our results showed that **OsmiR535** is induced under stressed conditions as compared to control.
