- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0148100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0148100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsPRP3</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Further the microscopic analysis revealed that **OsPRP3** enhances the cell wall integrity in the cold tolerant plant and confers cold-tolerance in rice.
   - Taken together, the results suggested that **OsPRP3** is a cell wall protein, playing a crucial role in determining extracellular matrix structure of floral organs.
   - Here we report a novel flower-specific PRP designated **OsPRP3** from rice.
   - Expression analysis showed that the **OsPRP3** transcript was mainly present in rice flower and accumulated abundantly during the late stage of the flower development.
   - Microscopic analysis of the RNAi mutant flower revealed that blocking **OsPRP3** function caused significant defects in floral organogenesis.
   - **OsPRP3**, a flower specific proline-rich protein of rice, determines extracellular matrix structure of floral organs and its overexpression confers cold-tolerance.
   - Our overexpression plants showed a significant increase in cold tolerance than the WT plants which is conferred by the accumulation of **OsPRP3** protein during cold treatment.
