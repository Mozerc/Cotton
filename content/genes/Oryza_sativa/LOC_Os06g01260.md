## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsPCS2** exhibits root- and shoot-specific differential ratios of alternatively spliced transcripts in indica rice under Cd stress, and plays role in Cd and As stress tolerance and accumulation.
   - Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both OsPCS1 and **OsPCS2** transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant.
   - Taken together, the findings indicate towards a crucial role played by the tissue-specific alternative splicing and relative abundance of the **OsPCS2** gene during heavy metal(loid) stress mitigation in rice plant.
   - Identification of alternatively spliced transcripts of rice phytochelatin synthase 2 gene **OsPCS2** involved in mitigation of cadmium and arsenic stresses.
   - ) has two PCSs (OsPCS1 and **OsPCS2**), and we previously revealed that OsPCS1 has a higher responsiveness to arsenic than to cadmium, while **OsPCS2** has a higher responsiveness to cadmium than to arsenic.
   - A chimeric protein in which the 183<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of **OsPCS2** were replaced with the 185<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS1 showed higher responsiveness to arsenite than to cadmium, similar to OsPCS1.
