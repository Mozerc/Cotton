## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [NONE](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=NONE)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os3g0703400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os3g0703400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsCSL1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study revealed that **OsCSL1** played roles in regulating the expression of multiple chloroplast synthesis-related genes, thereby affecting their functions, and leading to wide-ranging defects, including chlorotic seedlings and severely disrupted chloroplasts containing accumulated starch granules.
   - Additionally, disruption of **OsCSL1** led to reduced expression of chloroplast-associated genes, including chlorophyll biosynthetic genes, plastid-encoded RNA polymerases, nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase, and nuclear-encoded chloroplast genes.
   - Molecular cloning revealed that **OsCSL1** encoded a MAPK kinase kinase22 (MKKK22) targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and functional complementation of **OsCSL1** was found to restore the normal phenotype in csl1 plants.
