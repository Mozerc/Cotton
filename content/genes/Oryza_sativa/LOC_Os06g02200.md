## Functional Descriptions:
   - Accumulation of the RNA polymerase subunit RpoB depends on RNA editing by **OsPPR16** and affects chloroplast development during early leaf development in rice.
   - We found that **OsPPR16** is responsible for a single editing event at position 545 in the chloroplast rpoB mRNA, resulting in an amino acid change from serine to leucine in the <a6><c2>-subunit of the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase.
   - Thus, by editing the rpoB mRNA, **OsPPR16** is required for faithful plastid transcription, which in turn is required for chlorophyll synthesis and efficient chloroplast development.
   - In striking contrast to loss-of-function mutations of the putative orthologue in Arabidopsis, which were  reported to have no visible phenotype, knock-out of **OsPPR16** leads to impaired accumulation of RpoB, reduced expression of PEP-dependent genes and a pale phenotype during early plant development.
