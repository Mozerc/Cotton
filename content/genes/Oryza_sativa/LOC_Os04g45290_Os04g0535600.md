## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os04g45290](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g45290)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0535600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0535600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsINV2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - This was confirmed by **OsINV2** promoter::GUS studies, where its spatial and temporal expression in the panicle elongation stages showed that although **OsINV2** expression was observed from the stage with young panicles ~1 cm in length to the flag leaf stage, significant differences with respect to panicle and spikelet phenotypes between the wild-type and the mutant were not present.
   - However, complement lines displaying an overexpression phenotype of **OsINV2** possessed a higher stem non-structural carbohydrate content under both monoculm and normal tillering conditions.
   - A trade-off between the spikelet number and grain weight in the complement lines grown under monoculm conditions was also observed, pointing towards the necessity of **OsINV2** regulation for grain yield-related traits.
   - In summary, we identified OsINV3 as a positive regulator of grain size in rice, and while **OsINV2** has no function on grain size by itself.
   - In the absence of OsINV3, it is possible to detect a role of **OsINV2** in the regulation of grain size.
   - Both OsINV3 and **OsINV2** are involved in sucrose metabolism, and thus regulate grain size.
   - Altered sugar content with increased sucrose and decreased hexose levels, as well as changes vacuolar invertase activities and starch constitution in INV3KO, INV2KO, INV3KOINV2KO mutants indicate that **OsINV2** and OsINV3 affect sucrose metabolism in sink organs.
