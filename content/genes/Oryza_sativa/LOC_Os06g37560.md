## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os06g37560](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g37560)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0573600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0573600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsBGal2</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for **OsBGal2** in extracts of these tissues.
   - The genes encoding two isoforms of β-galactosidase expressed in germinating rice and panicle, designated OsBGal1 and **OsBGal2**, were cloned and sequenced.
   - The related **OsBGal2** clone from panicle at flowering stage encodes 715 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 20 residues.
   - Both were also expressed at low levels in flowers and immature seeds, but only the **OsBGal2** transcript was found in mature seeds.
