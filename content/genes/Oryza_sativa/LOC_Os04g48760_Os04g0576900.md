## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we identified a rice T-DNA insertion mutant for organ size, referred to as **XIAO**, that displays dwarfism and erect leaves, typical BR-related phenotypes, together with reduced seed setting.
   - The small stature of the **XIAO** mutant resulted from reduced organ sizes due to decreased cell numbers resulting from reduced cell division rate, as supported by the observed co-expression of **XIAO** with a number of genes involved in cell cycling.
   - **XIAO** is involved in the control of organ size by contributing to the regulation of signaling and homeostasis of brassinosteroids and cell cycling in rice.
   - The **XIAO** mutant displayed a tissue-specific enhanced BR response and greatly reduced BR contents at the whole-plant level.
   - These results indicated that **XIAO** is a regulator of BR signaling and cell division.
   - Thus, **XIAO** may provide a possible connection between BRs and cell-cycle regulation in controlling organ growth.
