## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice **TSV3** Encoding Obg-Like GTPase Protein Is Essential for Chloroplast Development During the Early Leaf Stage Under Cold Stress.
   - These observations suggest that the rice nuclear-encoded **TSV3** plays important roles in chloroplast development at early leaf stage under cold stress.
   - Expression of **TSV3** was high in leaves and weak or undetectable in other tissues, suggesting a tissue-specific expression of **TSV3** In the **TSV3** mutant, expression levels of genes associated with the biogenesis of the chloroplast ribosome 50S subunit were severely decreased at the 3-leaf-stage under cold stress (20<a1><e3>C), but could be recovered to normal levels at a higher temperature (32<a1><e3>C).
   - Map-based cloning and complementation experiments showed that **TSV3** encoded a small GTP-binding protein.
