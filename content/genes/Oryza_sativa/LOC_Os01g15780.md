- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Microscopic analyses revealed that **OsGT1** pollen developed normally to the pollen mitosis stage but failed to produce mature grains.
   - We examined the role of GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (**OsGT1**) in pollen wall development in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - In **OsGT1** pollen, intine structure was disrupted.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that **OsGT1** is a Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase essential for intine construction and pollen maturation, providing new insight into male reproductive development.
   - This study developed a genetically improved rice genotype by overexpressing a novel glycosyltransferase gene named **OsGT1** to accelerate removal of butachlor residues in rice crop and its growth environment.
   - The growth of the **OsGT1** overexpression rice (OsOE) was significantly improved and butachlor-induced cellular damage was greatly attenuated compared to its wild-type (WT).
   - Taken together, the reduced residues of parent butachlor in rice and its growth media point out that **OsGT1** plays a critical role in detoxifying and catabolizing the poisoning chemical in plants and its environment.
   - Both transcriptional expression and protein activates of **OsGT1** are considerably induced under butachlor stress.
