## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g03899](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g03899)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0133100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0133100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsVMT,OsZIFL12
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - At the vegetative stage, knockout of **OsVMT** resulted in decreased DMA but increased ferric Fe in the root cell sap.
   - The expression of **OsVMT** was induced by Fe deficiency in the roots but not in the shoot basal region and uppermost node.
   - **OsVMT** is highly expressed in the parenchyma cell bridges of node I where Fe and Zn are highly deposited.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **OsVMT** is involved in sequestering DMA into the vacuoles and that knockout of this gene enhances accumulation of Fe and Zn in polished rice grains through DMA-increased solubilization of Fe and Zn deposited in the node.
