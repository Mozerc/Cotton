## Functional Descriptions:
   - Regenerated **TDD1** plants showed pleiotropic phenotypes: dwarfing, narrow leaves, short roots and abnormal flowers.
   - Trp feeding completely rescued the mutant phenotypes and moderate expression of OsYUCCA1, which encodes a key enzyme in Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis, also rescued plant height and root length, indicating that the abnormal phenotypes of **TDD1** are caused predominantly by Trp and IAA deficiency.
   - **TDD1**-uidA and DR5-uidA expression overlapped at many sites in WT plants but was lacking in **TDD1**, indicating that **TDD1** is involved in auxin biosynthesis.
   - Both Trp and IAA levels in flowers and embryos were much lower in **TDD1** than in wild type (WT).
   - A rice tryptophan deficient dwarf mutant, **TDD1**, contains a reduced level of indole acetic acid and develops abnormal flowers and organless embryos.
   - Here, we report the analysis of a rice tryptophan- (Trp-) and IAA-deficient mutant, tryptophan deficient dwarf1 (**TDD1**), which is embryonic lethal because of a failure to develop most organs during embryogenesis.
   - **TDD1** encodes a protein homologous to anthranilate synthase beta-subunit, which catalyses the first step of the Trp biosynthesis pathway and functions upstream of Trp-dependent IAA biosynthesis.
   - In **TDD1** embryos, the expression patterns of OSH1 and OsSCR, which mark the presumptive apical region and the L2 layer, respectively, are identical to those in WT, suggesting a possibility either that different IAA levels are required for basic pattern formation than for organ formation or that an orthologous gene compensates for **TDD1** deficiency during pattern formation.
