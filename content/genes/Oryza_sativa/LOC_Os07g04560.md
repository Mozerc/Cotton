## Functional Descriptions:
   - Mutation of **ONAC096** Enhances Grain Yield by Increasing Panicle Number and Delaying Leaf Senescence during Grain Filling in Rice.
   - Here, we report that rice **ONAC096** affects grain yield by regulating leaf senescence and panicle number.
   - Two independent T-DNA insertion mutants (**ONAC096**-1 and **ONAC096**-2) with downregulated **ONAC096** expression retained their green leaf color during natural senescence in the field, thus extending their photosynthetic capacity.
   - Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR analysis showed that **ONAC096** upregulated genes controlling chlorophyll degradation and leaf senescence.
   - **ONAC096** mediates abscisic acid (ABA)-induced leaf senescence by upregulating the ABA signaling genes ABA INSENSITIVE5 and ENHANCED EM LEVEL.
   - **ONAC096** expression increased rapidly in rice leaves upon the initiation of aging- and dark-induced senescence.
   - Repressed OsCKX2 (encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) expression in the **ONAC096** mutants led to a 15% increase in panicle number without affecting grain weight or fertility.
   - The **ONAC096** mutants showed a 16% increase in grain yield, highlighting the potential for using this gene to increase grain production.
   - A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor **ONAC096** Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.
   - RNA-seq transcriptomic profiling and qRT-PCR analysis identified a small set of defense and signaling genes that are putatively regulated by **ONAC096**, and further biochemical analysis validated that **ONAC096** could directly bind to the promoters of OsRap2.
   - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of **ONAC096** attenuated rice immunity and flg22-induced reactive oxygen species burst and expression of PTI marker genes OsWRKY45 and OsPAL4; by contrast, overexpression of **ONAC096** enhanced rice immunity or flg22-induced PTI.
   - **ONAC096** interacts with ONAC066, which is a positive regulator of rice immunity.
   - These results demonstrate that **ONAC096** positively contributes to rice immunity against M.
   - **ONAC096** had the DNA binding ability to NAC recognition sequence and was found to be a nucleus-localized transcriptional activator whose activity depended on its C-terminal.
