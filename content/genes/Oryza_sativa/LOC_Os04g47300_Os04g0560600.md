- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Collectively, our results suggest that **OsCPK12** functions in multiple signaling pathways, positively regulating salt tolerance and negatively modulating blast resistance.
   - A rice calcium-dependent protein kinase **OsCPK12** oppositely modulates salt-stress tolerance and blast disease resistance.
   - We investigated the effects of overexpression and disruption of an Oryza sativa (rice) CDPK (**OsCPK12**) on the plant's response to abiotic and biotic stresses.
   - Eight genes, OsCPK2, OsCPK11, OsCPK14, OsCPK22, OsCPK25, OsCPK26, OsCPK27 and OsCPK29 were found dominantly expressed in the panicle and the stamen, and five genes, OsCPK6, OsCPK7, **OsCPK12**, OsCPK23 and OsCPK31 were up-regulated in the endosperm stage.
   - We also observed that **OsCPK12**-OX seedlings had increased sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) and increased susceptibility to blast fungus, probably resulting from the repression of ROS production and/or the involvement of **OsCPK12** in the ABA signaling pathway.
   - Conversely, a retrotransposon (Tos17) insertion mutant, **OsCPK12**, and plants transformed with an **OsCPK12** RNA interference (RNAi) construct were more sensitive to high salinity than were WT plants.
   - **OsCPK12**-overexpressing (**OsCPK12**-OX) plants exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress.
   - These results suggest that **OsCPK12** promotes tolerance to salt stress by reducing the accumulation of ROS.
   - We found that overexpression of **OsCPK12** FL-cDNA, encoding a calcium-dependent protein kinase ( CDPK), conferred tolerance to low-nitrogen stress in rice.
   - After two weeks of low-nitrogen treatment, dry weights of shoots from **OsCPK12**-overexpressing plants were greater than those from control plants.
   - Furthermore, total nitrogen contents of **OsCPK12**-overexpressing plants were higher than those of the control plants.
   - Our findings suggest that **OsCPK12** is involved in the signal transduction pathway(s) in the low-nitrogen stress response and may be useful in engineering crop plants with improved tolerance to low nitrogen levels.
   - Our results demonstrate that the mutant of **OsCPK12** triggers the premature leaf senescence; however, the overexpression of **OsCPK12** may delay its growth period and provide the potentially positive effect on productivity in rice.
   - We used CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted disruption of **OsCPK12** in ZH8015 and all the mutants exhibited the premature senescence.
   - Sequencing analysis in target interval indicated there was an eight bases deletion mutation in **OsCPK12** which encoded a calcium-dependent protein kinase.
