- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os09g0123200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os09g0123200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FCA</u>&nbsp;<u>OsFCA</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **FCA**/FY interaction is also required for the regulation of FLC expression, a major floral repressor in Arabidopsis.
   - The expression of **OsFCA**-1 is steady in the leaves of three different stage, but up-regulated in young spikelet of primary branch-differentiating stage and down-regulated in young spikelet of pistil and stamen-differentiating stage.
   - In order to acquire further insight into the control of heading dates in rice, we isolated and conducted an expression analysis on **OsFCA**, which exhibited 38% sequence homology with Arabidopsis FCA.
   - The **FCA** floral promotion gene in Arabidopsis encodes a protein, containing two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a WW protein interaction domain.
   - Survey of rice proteins interacting with **OsFCA** and OsFY proteins which are homologous to the Arabidopsis flowering time proteins, FCA and FY.
   - Recently, alternative RNA processing of **OsFCA** was observed in rice, which strongly suggested the existence of an autonomous flowering pathway in rice.
   - The beta and gamma transcripts of the **OsFCA** gene were detected via Northern analysis in the leaves, roots, and flowers of the plant.
   - The **FCA** protein is involved in controlling flowering time and plays more general roles in RNA-mediated chromatin silencing in Arabidopsis.
   - **FCA** and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis.
   - The overexpression of **OsFCA** cDNA, driven by the 35S promoter, was shown to partially rescue the late flowering phenotype of the fca mutant, suggesting that the functions of the **OsFCA** and the FCA are partially overlapped, despite the lack of an apparent FLC homologue in the rice genome.
   - These results indicate that the autonomous flowering pathway is present in monocots, and the regulation through FY and **FCA** interaction is conserved between monocots and dicots.
