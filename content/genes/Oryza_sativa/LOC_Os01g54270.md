## Functional Descriptions:
   - Besides, in **D10**-RNAi plants, decreased storage cytokinin levels in the shoot node may partly account for the increased active cytokinin contents, resulting in more tillering phenotypes.
   - Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that accumulation of **D10** mRNA is induced by exogenous auxin.
   - **D10** is a rice ortholog of MAX4/RMS1/DAD1 that encodes a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 and is supposed to be involved in the synthesis of an unidentified inhibitor of shoot branching.
   - We discovered a triazole-type chemical, TIS13 [2,2-dimethyl-7-phenoxy-4-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)heptan-3-ol], which induced outgrowth of second tiller buds of wild-type seedlings, as observed for non-treated strigolactone-deficient **D10** mutant seedlings.
   - Moreover, **D10** expression is upregulated in six branching mutants, d3, **D10**, d14, d17, d27 and high tillering dwarf (htd1).
   - Here we use **D10**- RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants similar to **D10** mutant in phenotypes to investigate the interactions among **D10**, auxin and cytokinin in regulating rice shoot branching.
   - Auxin levels in node 1 of both decapitated **D10**-RNAi and wild type plants decreased significantly, showing that decapitation does reduce endogenous auxin concentration, but decapitation has no clear effects on auxin levels in node 2 of the same plants.
   - This implies that node 1 may be the location where a possible interaction between auxin and **D10** gene would be detected.
   - **D10** expression in node 1 is inhibited by decapitation, and this inhibition can be restored by exogenous auxin application, indicating that **D10** may play an important role in auxin regulation of SL.
   - The decreased expression of most OsPINs in shoot nodes of **D10**-RNAi plants may cause a reduced auxin transport capacity.
   - Furthermore, effects of auxin treatment of decapitated plants on the expression of cytokinin biosynthetic genes suggest that **D10** promotes cytokinin biosynthesis by reducing auxin levels.
   - In dwarf10 (**D10**), an enhanced branching mutant of rice, apical dominance can be observed, but the inhibitory effects of the apical meristem was reduced.
   - The d14 mutant exhibits increased shoot branch-ing with reduced plant height like the previously characterized strigolactone-deficient and -insensitive mutants **D10** and d3, respectively.
   - However, unlike with **D10**, the d14 branching phenotype could not be rescued by exogenous strigolactones.
   - Loss of function of HTD2 resulted in a significantly increased expression of HTD1, **D10** and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway.
   - Moreover, the mRNA levels of D3, HTD1 and **D10**, which are orthologs of Arabidopsis MAX2/ORE9, MAX3 and MAX4, respectively, increased during cell death.
   - Previous studies have shown that DWARF10 (**D10**) is a rice ortholog of MAX4/RMS1/DAD1, encoding a carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase and functioning in strigolactones/strigolactone-derivatives (SL) biosynthesis.
   - These findings imply that **D10** transcription might be a critical step in the regulation of the branching inhibitor pathway.
