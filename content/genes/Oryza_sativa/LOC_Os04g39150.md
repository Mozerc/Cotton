- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsMLP423** Is a Positive Regulator of Tolerance to Drought and Salt Stresses in Rice.
   - The results of real-time PCR showed that **OsMLP423** was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses.
   - The physiological and biochemical phenotype analysis of transgenic plants confirmed that overexpression of **OsMLP423** enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt stresses in rice.
   - Physiological analyses showed that the overexpression of **OsMLP423** may regulate the water loss efficiency and ABA-responsive gene expression of rice plants under drought and salt stresses, and it reduces membrane damage and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.
   - These results indicate that **OsMLP423** is a positive regulator of drought and salinity tolerance in rice, governing the tolerance of rice to abiotic stresses through an ABA-dependent pathway.
   - The expression of **OsMLP423**-GFP fusion protein indicated that **OsMLP423** was located in both the cell membrane system and nucleus.
   - Compared with the wild type, the overexpressed **OsMLP423** showed enhanced sensitivity to ABA.
