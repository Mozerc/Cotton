## Functional Descriptions:
   - We report here the expression and biological functions of a previously uncharacterized rice gene that we have named **NRR** (nutrition response and root growth).
   - Expression of **NRR** in rice seedling roots was significantly influenced by deficiency of macronutrients.
   - Knock-down of expression of **NRR**a or **NRR**b by RNA interference resulted in enhanced rice root growth.
   - By contrast, overexpression of **NRR**a in rice exhibited significantly retarded root growth.
   - These results revealed that both **NRR**a and **NRR**b played negative regulatory roles in rice root growth.
   - Our findings suggest that **NRR**a and **NRR**b, acting as the key components, modulate the rice root architecture with the availability of macronutrients.
   - A novel rice gene, **NRR** responds to macronutrient deficiency and regulates root growth.
   - Promoter GUS analysis showed that **CRCT** was highly expressed in the phloem of various tissues such as leaf blade and leaf sheath.
   - Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of **CRCT** had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression.
   - CO2 Responsive CCT protein, **CRCT** Is a Positive Regulator of Starch Synthesis in Vegetative Organs of Rice.
   - The expressions of several genes related to starch synthesis such as ADP-glucose pyrophospholylase and Î±-glucan phospholylase were significantly changed in transgenic lines and positively correlated with the expression levels of **CRCT**.
   - Given these observations, we suggest that **CRCT** is a positive regulator of starch accumulation in vegetative tissues, regulating coordinated expression of starch synthesis genes in response to the levels of photoassimilates.
   - The expression of **CRCT** showed diurnal oscillation peaked at the end of light period and was also increased by sugars such as glucose and sucrose.
   - In this study, we analyzed the effects of the starch level in the leaf sheath on the photosynthetic rate in leaf blade using **CRCT** overexpression and RNAi knockdown transgenic rice grown under ambient (38 Pa) or elevated (100 Pa) CO2 conditions.
   - In leaf sheath, the starch content was markedly changed in relation to **CRCT** expression levels under both CO2 conditions.
