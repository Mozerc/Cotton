## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identification and expression analysis of OsLPR family revealed the potential roles of **OsLPR3** and 5 in maintaining phosphate homeostasis in rice.
   - The results from this study provided insights into the evolutionary expansion and a likely functional divergence of OsLPR family with potential roles of **OsLPR3** and 5 in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis in rice.
   - Pi deficiency (-P) triggered significant increases in the relative expression levels of **OsLPR3** and 5.
   - **OsLPR3** was found to be induced in the leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots under Pi deprivation.
   - **OsLPR3** overexpression strongly inhibited the growth and development of the rice but did not affect the Pi homeostasis of the plant.
   - The agronomic traits of the **OsLPR3** mutants, such as 1000-grain weight and seed length, were stimulated under Pi-sufficient conditions, indicating that **OsLPR3** plays roles different from those of OsLPR5 during plant growth and development, as well as in the maintenance of the Pi status of rice.
   - However, **OsLPR3** mutants improved RSA and Pi utilization, and they exhibited a higher tolerance to low Pi stress in rice.
   - Mutation of **OsLPR3** Enhances Tolerance to Phosphate Starvation in Rice.
