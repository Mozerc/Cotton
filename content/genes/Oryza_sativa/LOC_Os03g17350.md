## Functional Descriptions:
   - To investigate the possibility of similar mechanisms operating in the control of inflorescence architecture in rice, we analysed the functions of **Rcn1** and RCN2, rice TFL1/CEN homologs.
   - Phenotypic analyses of **Rcn1** and tillering dwarf 3 (d3) double mutants at the seedling stage clarified that **Rcn1** works independently of D3 in the branching inhibitor pathway.
   - Since the shoot architecture of the rcn11 was very similar to that of the rcn1, we examined whether RCN11 is involved in RCN1/**OsABCG5**-associated vegetative growth control.
   - The rcn1 rcn11 phenotype suggests that RCN11 acts on vegetative growth independent of RCN1/**OsABCG5**.
   - Thus, **Rcn1**1 will shed new light on vegetative growth control under low temperature.
   - The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/**OsABCG5**.
   - A root development comparison between **Rcn1** and **Rcn1**1 in young seedlings represented that **Rcn1**1 reduced crown root number and elongation, whereas **Rcn1** reduced lateral root density and elongation.
   - We isolated a novel reduced culm number mutant, designated reduced culm number11 (**Rcn1**1), by screening under low-temperature condition in a paddy fields.
   - In 35S::**Rcn1** and 35S::RCN2 transgenic rice plants, the delay of transition to the reproductive phase was observed.
   - Mutant genes, reduced culm number 1 (**Rcn1**) and bunketsuwaito tillering dwarf (d3), affect tiller number in rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - Genetic interaction between 2 tillering genes, reduced culm number 1 (**Rcn1**) and tillering dwarf gene d3, in rice.
   - In addition, **Rcn1** is expressed in the crown root primordia, endodermis, pericycle and stele in the root.
   - A new **Rcn1** mutant, designated as S-97-61 exhibited a reduction in tiller number and plant stature to about the same level as the previously reported original **Rcn1** mutant.
   - The reduction in tillering by the **Rcn1** mutation was independent of the d3 genotype, and tillering number of d3**Rcn1** double mutant was between those of the d3 and **Rcn1** mutants.
   - These results demonstrated that the **Rcn1** gene was not involved in the D3-associated pathway in tillering control.
   - The GIGANTEA and TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog (**Rcn1**) that cause delayed flowering were upregulated in ETR2-overexpressing plants but downregulated in the etr2 mutant.
   - Constitutive overexpression of **Rcn1** or RCN2 in Arabidopsis caused a late-flowering and highly branching phenotype, indicating that they possess conserved biochemical functions as TFL1.
   - No effect on **Rcn1** expression in shoots or roots was seen when the roots were treated with auxins.
   - * Here, characterization of rice (Oryza sativa) reduced culm number 1 (**Rcn1**) mutants revealed that **Rcn1** positively controls shoot branching by promoting the outgrowth of lateral shoots.
   - Overexpression of**Rcn1**andRCN2, riceTERMINAL FLOWER 1/CENTRORADIALIShomologs, confers delay of phase transition and altered panicle morphology in rice.
   - * **Rcn1** is the first functionally defined plant ABCG protein gene that controls shoot branching and could thus be significant in future breeding for high-yielding rice.
   - * **Rcn1** is expressed in leaf primordia of main and axillary shoots, and in the vascular cells and leaf epidermis of older leaves.
   - RCN1/**OsABCG5**, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, is required for hypodermal suberization of roots in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - In many plant species, including rice (Oryza sativa), the hypodermis in the outer part of roots forms a suberized cell wall (the Casparian strip and/or suberin lamellae), which inhibits the flow of water and ions and protects against pathogens.
   - We discovered that a rice reduced culm number1 (**Rcn1**) mutant could not develop roots longer than 100 mm in waterlogged soil.
   - RCN1/**OsABCG5** gene expression in the wild type was increased in most hypodermal and some endodermal roots cells under stagnant deoxygenated conditions.
   - These findings suggest that RCN1/**OsABCG5** has a role in the suberization of the hypodermis of rice roots, which contributes to formation of the apoplastic barrier.
   - The mutated gene encoded an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter named RCN1/**OsABCG5**.
   - A GFP-RCN1/**OsABCG5** fusion protein localized at the plasma membrane of the wild type.
   - ABA application resulted in a smaller increase in the percentage of guard cell pairs containing ABA in **Rcn1** mutant (A684P) and **Rcn1**-RNAi than in wild-type plants.
   - Furthermore, polyethylene glycol (drought stress)-inducible ABA accumulation in guard cells did not occur in **Rcn1** mutants.
   - Stomata closure mediated by exogenous ABA application was strongly reduced in **Rcn1** mutants.
   - Finally, **Rcn1** mutant plants had more rapid water loss from detached leaves than the wild-type plants.
