## Functional Descriptions:
   - Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of **OsMYB48-1** could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions.
   - Collectively, these results suggested that **OsMYB48-1** functions as a novel MYB-related TF which plays a positive role in drought and salinity tolerance by regulating stress-induced ABA synthesis.
   - Expression of **OsMYB48-1** was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2, and dehydration, while being slightly induced by high salinity and cold treatment.
   - Overexpression of **OsMYB48-1** in rice significantly improved tolerance to simulated drought and salinity stresses caused by mannitol, PEG, and NaCl, respectively, and drought stress was caused by drying the soil.
   - Overexpression of **OsMYB48-1**, a novel MYB-related transcription factor, enhances drought and salinity tolerance in rice.
   - Quantitative real-time PCR uncovered that the **OsMYB59** reacted to abiotic stresses where its expression was increased in BRRI dhan56 but decreased in other varieties on K(+) deficient medium.
