- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0139000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0139000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsDEG10
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsDEG10** RNAi transgenic plants were more sensitive to high light and cold stresses compared to wild-type plants.
   - Among them, **OsDEG10** is predicted to encode a small RNA-binding protein (RBP) and the transcript levels of **OsDEG10** strongly increased under most of abiotic stress treatments such as high light, anoxia, NaCl, ABA, MV and cold.
   - Our results suggest that **OsDEG10** is a small RBP involved in the response to various abiotic stresses.
   - **OsDEG10** encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling.
