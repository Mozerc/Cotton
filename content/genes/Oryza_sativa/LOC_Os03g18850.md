## Functional Descriptions:
   - ) gene, homologous to a sorghum pathogenesis-related class 10 protein gene, was cloned from a cDNA library prepared from 2-week-old jasmonic acid-treated rice seedling leaves, and named as **JIOsPR10** (jasmonate inducible).
   - Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel Jasmonate inducible pathogenesis-related class 10 protein gene, **JIOsPR10**, from rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedling leaves.
   - Western blots revealed that the **JIOsPR10** protein was expressed in developmental tissues, including in flower and root.
   - Using immunohistochemical techniques, we determined that expression of **JIOsPR10** was localized to the palea of flower, in the exodermis, and inner part of the endodermis of the root.
   - We previously reported that rice blast fungus or jasmonic acid induced the expression of rice pathogenesis-related class 10 (**JIOsPR10**) proteins (Kim et al.
   - Further expression analysis revealed that the signaling components of defense/stress pathways, jasmonate, salicylate, and H(2)O(2) significantly up-regulated the **JIOsPR10** mRNA over the cut control, whereas two other stress regulators, ethylene and abscisic acid, failed to induce its expression.
   - Finally, the blast pathogen (Magnaporthe grisea) also specifically elicited the accumulation of **JIOsPR10** mRNA in leaves.
   - Taken together, we hypothesize that the **JIOsPR10** protein possesses RNase activity that is sensitive to DTT, suggesting the importance of the disulfide bonding between cysteine residues and that it might play a role in constitutive self-defense mechanisms in plants against biotic and abiotic stresses.
   - The rice pathogen-related protein 10 (**JIOsPR10**) is induced by abiotic and biotic stresses and exhibits ribonuclease activity.
   - Induction of the **JIOsPR10** gene expression by signaling molecules, PP inhibitors and pathogen attack, strongly indicate a role for this novel gene in rice self-defense/stress response(s).
   - Constitutive over-expression **JIOsPR10** in rice promoted shoot and root development in transgenic plants, however, their productivity was unaltered.
   - A comparative proteomic profiling of wild type and transgenic plants showed that overexpression of **JIOsPR10** led to the differential modulation of several proteins mainly related with oxidative stresses, carbohydrate metabolism, and plant defense.
   - Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed up-regulation of **JIOsPR10** under salt and drought stress conditions.
   - Taken together, our findings suggest that **JIOsPR10** plays important roles in biotic and abiotic stresses tolerance probably by activation of stress related proteins.
   - OsWRKY19 binds to the promoter of **OsPR10** to activate the defence response.
