## Functional Descriptions:
   - The rice mitochondrial genome has a sequence homologous to the gene for ribosomal protein S14 (**RPS14**), but the coding sequence is interrupted by internal stop codons.
   - The nuclear **RPS14** gene encodes a long N-terminal extension showing significant similarity to a part of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) protein from human and a malarial parasite (Plasmodium falciparum).
   - Considering that the rice mitochondrial genome lacks the sdhB gene but contains the **RPS14**-related sequence, transfer of the sdhB gene seems to have occurred before the transfer of the **RPS14** gene.
   - The migration of the mitochondrial **RPS14** sequence into the already existing sdhB gene could bestow the capacity for nuclear expression and mitochondrial targeting.
   - A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial **RPS14** and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins.
   - Taken together, **OsSDH2-1** plays a crucial role in leaf senescence and yield formation in rice.
   - **OsSDH2-1** gene was expressed in all organs tested, with higher expression in leaves, root tips, ovary and anthers.
   - **OsSDH2-1** protein was targeted to mitochondria.
