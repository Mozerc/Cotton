## Functional Descriptions:
   - In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), OsPT2, **OsPT3**, OsPT6 and OsPT8.
   - **OsPht1;3** was directly regulated by OsPHR2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades.
   - Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of **OsPht1;3** was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles.
   - **OsPht1;3** Mediates Uptake, Translocation and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes.
   - **OsPht1;3** was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
   - Overexpression of **OsPht1;3** led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots.
   - However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members which facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of **OsPht1;3** impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 <a6><cc>M.
   - An isotope labeling experiment with 32P showed that **OsPht1;3** mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **OsPht1;3** acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.
