## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using laser microdissection and microarrays, we found that expression of PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (**PAP2**) and three APETALA1 (AP1)/FRUITFULL (FUL)-like genes (MADS14, MADS15, and MADS18) is induced in the SAM during meristem phase transition in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - In addition, **OsMADS34** mutants displayed a decreased spikelet number and altered spikelet morphology, with lemma/leaf-like elongated sterile lemmas.
   - We demonstrate the ubiquitous expression of **OsMADS34** in roots, leaves, and primordia of inflorescence and spikelet organs.
   - Moreover, analysis of the double mutant **OsMADS34** osmads1 suggests that **OsMADS34** specifies the identities of floral organs, including the lemma/palea, lodicules, stamens, and carpel, in combination with another rice SEP-like gene, OsMADS1.
   - Furthermore, the precocious flowering phenotype caused by the overexpression of Hd3a, a rice florigen gene, was weakened in **PAP2**-1 mutants.
   - In the panicle of the panicle phytomer2-1 (**PAP2**-1) mutant, the pattern of meristem initiation is disorganized and newly formed meristems show reduced competency to become spikelet meristems, resulting in the transformation of early arising spikelets into rachis branches.
   - PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (**PAP2**), encoding a SEPALLATA subfamily MADS-box protein, positively controls spikelet meristem identity in rice.
   - Here, we report the biological role of one SEPALLATA (SEP)-like gene, **OsMADS34**, in controlling the development of inflorescences and spikelets in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Compared with the wild type, **OsMADS34** mutants developed altered inflorescence morphology, with an increased number of primary branches and a decreased number of secondary branches.
   - Collectively, our study suggests that the origin and diversification of **OsMADS34** and OsMADS1 contribute to the origin of distinct grass inflorescences and spikelets.
   - The SEPALLATA-like gene **OsMADS34** is required for rice inflorescence and spikelet development.
   - Our findings support the hypothesis that OUIs originated from the lemmas of degenerate florets under the negative control of **OsMADS34**.
   - The pleiotropic SEPALLATA-like gene **OsMADS34** reveals that the 'empty glumes' of rice (Oryza sativa) spikelets are in fact rudimentary lemmas.
   - We propose that **PAP2** is a positive regulator of spikelet meristem identity.
   - **PAP2** expression starts the earliest among the five SEP genes, and a low but significant level of **PAP2** mRNA was detected in the inflorescence meristem, in branch meristems immediately after the transition, and in glume primordia, consistent with its role in the early development of spikelet formation.
   - Here we present a novel mutant of the rice SEPALLATA-like gene **OsMADS34** which develops, in addition to disorganized branches and sterile seeds, elongated OUIs.
   - Inflorescence meristem identity in rice is specified by overlapping functions of three AP1/FUL-like MADS box genes and **PAP2**, a SEPALLATA MADS box gene.
   - Further depletion of **PAP2** function from these triple knockdown plants inhibited the transition of the meristem to the IM.
   - Based on these results, we propose that **PAP2** and the three AP1/FUL-like genes coordinately act in the meristem to specify the identity of the IM downstream of the florigen signal.
   - Regulatory Role of **OsMADS34** in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice..
   - In this study, we used m34-z, a new mutant allele of the rice (Oryza sativa) E-class gene **OsMADS34**, to examine **OsMADS34** function in determining the identities of glumes (rudimentary glume and sterile lemma) and grain size.
   - Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that **OsMADS34** protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant.
   - These findings revealed that **OsMADS34** largely affects grain yield by affecting the size of grains from the secondary branches.
   - In the m34-z mutant, both the rudimentary glume and sterile lemma were homeotically converted to the lemma-like organ and acquired the lemma identity, suggesting that **OsMADS34** plays important roles in the development of glumes.
   - Regulatory network and genetic interactions established by **OsMADS34** in rice inflorescence and spikelet morphogenesis..
   - Collectively, these findings provide insights into the regulatory function of **OsMADS34** in rice inflorescence and spikelet development.
   - longer and wider sterile lemmas that were converted into lemma/palea like organs, suggesting that ELE and **OsMADS34** synergistically control the sterile lemma development.
   - **OsMADS34** may act together OsMADS15 in controlling sterile lemma development.
   - Genetic analysis revealed that **OsMADS34** controls different aspects of inflorescence structure, branching and meristem activity synergistically with LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), as evidenced by the enhanced phenotypes of **OsMADS34** lax1 and **OsMADS34** fon4 compared with the single mutants.
   - Microarray analysis showed that, at the very early stages of inflorescence formation, dysfunction of **OsMADS34** caused altered expression of 379 genes that are associated with protein modification and degradation, transcriptional regulation, signaling and metabolism activity.
   - Additionally, double mutant between **OsMADS34** and the sterile lemma defective mutant elongated empty glume (ele) displayed an enhanced phenotype, i.
   - Our results reveal a role for OsMADS5 in panicle development, and show that OsMADS5 and **OsMADS34** play similar functions in limiting branching and promoting the transition to spikelet meristem identity, in part by repressing RCN4 expression.
   - We have generated loss-of-function and overexpression mutants of the paralogous OsMADS5 and **OsMADS34** genes in rice (Oryza sativa), and analysed their panicle phenotypes.
   - The osmads5 **OsMADS34** mutant lines had significantly enhanced panicle branching with increased secondary, and even tertiary and quaternary, branches, compared to wild-type (WT) and **OsMADS34** plants.
   - Rice SEPALLATA genes OsMADS5 and **OsMADS34** cooperate to limit inflorescence branching by repressing the TERMINAL FLOWER1-like gene RCN4..
