## Functional Descriptions:
   - As compared to the WT tobacco plants, the transgenic plants ectopically expressing **OsHBP1b** showed better survival and favourable osmotic parameters (such as germination and survival rate, membrane stability, K(+)/Na(+) ratio, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage and proline contents) under salinity and drought stress.
   - qRT-PCR based expression studies for **OsHBP1b** in seedlings of contrasting genotypes of rice showed its differential regulation in response to salinity stress.
   - Taken together, our findings suggest that **OsHBP1b** contributes to abiotic stress tolerance through multiple physiological pathways and thus, may serve as a useful 'candidate gene' for improving multiple stress tolerance in crop plants.
   - In the present study, we over-express the full-length gene encoding **OsHBP1b** in the homologous system (rice) to assess its contribution towards multiple stress tolerance and grain yield.
   - Recently, we have reported the characterization of **OsHBP1b** in relation to salinity and drought tolerance in a model system tobacco.
   - We provide evidence to show that transgenic rice plants over-expressing **OsHBP1b** exhibit better survival and favourable osmotic parameters under salinity stress than the wild type counterparts.
   - Phosphorylation of **OsTGA5** by casein kinase II compromises its suppression of defense-related gene transcription in rice..
   - Importantly, we showed that the nucleus-localized casein kinase II (CK2) complex interacts with and phosphorylates **OsTGA5** on Ser-32, which reduces the affinity of **OsTGA5** for the JIOsPR10 promoter, thereby alleviating the repression of JIOsPR10 transcription and increasing rice resistance.
   - In this study, we characterized the role of **OsTGA5** as a negative regulator of rice resistance against blast fungus by transcriptionally repressing the expression of various defense-related genes.
   - Moreover, **OsTGA5** repressed PTI responses and the accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid.
   - Furthermore, the in vivo phosphorylation of **OsTGA5** Ser-32 was enhanced by blast fungus infection.
   - Taken together, our results provide a mechanism for the role of **OsTGA5** in negatively regulating the transcription of defense-related genes in rice and the repressive switch imposed by nuclear CK2-mediated phosphorylation during blast fungus invasion.
