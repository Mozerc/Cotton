## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of rice gene **OsATG8b** confers tolerance to nitrogen starvation and increases yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in Arabidopsis..
   - Further examination revealed that overexpression of **OsATG8b** could effectively alleviate the growth inhibition of transgenic Arabidopsis under nitrogen (N) stress.
   - It was also showed that over-expressing **OsATG8b** promoted growth and development of Arabidopsis, in which the rosette leaves were larger than those of the wild type (WT), and the yield increased significantly by 25.
   - A Rice Autophagy Gene **OsATG8b** Is Involved in Nitrogen Remobilization and Control  of Grain Quality..
   - We identified the rice gene **OsATG8b** and characterized its role in N remobilization to affect grain quality by generating  transgenic plants with its over-expression and knockdown.
   - The autophagic role of **OsATG8b** was experimentally confirmed, and it was concluded that **OsATG8b**-mediated autophagy is involved in N recycling to grains and contributes to the grain quality, indicating that **OsATG8b** may be a potential gene for molecular breeding and cultivation of rice.
