## Functional Descriptions:
   - However, upon ectopic expression, **WIN1** appears on the longitudinal sides of leaf sheath cells, correlated with the appearance of a spiral phenotype in shoots.
   - Interestingly, ectopic expression of **WIN1** does not cause either unequal auxin distribution or actin filament differences in roots, so a spiral phenotype is not observed in roots.
   - The action of **WIN1** appears to be different from that of other proteins causing a spiral phenotype, and it is likely that **WIN1** is involved in 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid-insensitive plasmodesmata-mediated auxin transport.
   - The **WIN1** protein is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane, but is also co-localized to plasmodesmata, where it exhibits a punctate pattern.
