## Functional Descriptions:
   - The nearly-isogenic line (NIL-**An-1**) carrying a wild allele **An-1** in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai4 produces long awns and longer grains, but significantly fewer grains per panicle compared with Guangluai4.
   - Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the **An-1** locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice.
   - Transgenic studies confirmed that **An-1** positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle.
   - **An-1** encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice.
   - We report here the molecular cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, **An-1**, which regulates long awn formation in O.
   - Genetic variations in the **An-1** locus were found to be associated with awn loss in cultivated rice.
   - **An-1** encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein, which regulates cell division.
   - Analyses of minimum spanning trees and introgression regions demonstrated that **An-1**, an important gene for awn formation, was preferentially domesticated, and its mutation to **An-1** was followed by GLA and An-2.
