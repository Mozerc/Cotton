## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional analysis using either **GF14c** overexpression or knockout transgenic rice plants indicated that this interaction plays a role in the regulation of flowering.
   - **GF14c**-overexpressing plants exhibited a delay in flowering and the knockout mutants displayed early flowering relative to the wild-type plants under short-day conditions.
   - These results suggest that **GF14c** acts as a negative regulator of flowering by interacting with Hd3a.
   - The 14-3-3 protein **GF14c** acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a.
   - Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or **GF14c** enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings.
   - The 14-3-3 protein **GF14c** positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.
   - Taken together, these findings uncover the important roles of OsSCL7 and **GF14c** in plant immunity and a potential mechanism by which plants fine-tune immunity by regulating the protein stability of a GRAS protein via a 14-3-3 protein.
   - Overexpression of **OsGF14C** enhances salinity tolerance but reduces blast resistance in rice.
   - To understand the functions and regulatory mechanisms of **OsGF14C** in regulating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice, we have conducted **OsGF14C**-overexpressing transgenic experiments in the present study.
   - Our results showed that overexpression of **OsGF14C** enhanced salinity tolerance but reduced blast resistance in rice.
   - The enhanced salinity tolerance is related to the reduction of methylglyoxal and Na(+) uptake instead of exclusion or compartmentation and the negative role of **OsGF14C** in blast resistance is associated with the suppression of OsGF14E, OsGF14F and PR genes.
   - Our results together with the results from the previous studies suggest that the lipoxygenase gene LOX2 which is regulated by **OsGF14C** may play roles in coordinating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice.
   - The current study for the first time revealed the possible roles of **OsGF14C** in regulating salinity tolerance and blast resistance in rice, and laid down a foundation for further functional study and crosstalk regulation between salinity and blast resistance in rice.
