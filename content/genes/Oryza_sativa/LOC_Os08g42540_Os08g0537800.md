## Functional Descriptions:
   - **WTG1** determines grain size and shape mainly by influencing cell expansion.
   - Overexpression of **WTG1** results in narrow, thin and long grains due to narrow and long cells, further supporting the role of **WTG1** in determining grain size and shape.
   - Thus, our findings identify the otubain-like protease **WTG1** as an important factor that determines grain size and shape, suggesting **WTG1** has the potential to improve grain size and shape in rice.
   - **WTG1** is expressed in developing grains and panicles, and the GFP-**WTG1** fusion protein is present in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
   - **OsOTUB1** interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14.
   - Downregulation of **OsOTUB1** enhances meristematic activity, resulting in reduced tiller number, increased grain number, enhanced grain weight and a consequent increase in grain yield in rice.
   - Conversely, loss-of-function of **OsOTUB1** is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14, resulting in the NPT architecture.
   - **GWC1** is essential for high grain quality in rice.
   - The **GWC1** mutants had poor grain appearance quality consistent with the measured values for the percentage of grains with chalkiness, square of chalky endosperm, the total starch, amylose and sucrose contents.
   - Milling quality and grain size were also affected in the **GWC1** mutants.
   - **GWC1** is likely to regulate grain appearance quality through genes involved in sucrose metabolism and starch biosynthesis.
   - Overall, the present findings reveal that **GWC1** is important for grain quality and yield due to its effects on grain chalkiness and size.
   - **GWC1** transcripts accumulated to high levels in early endosperm after fertilization and developing inflorescences, and **GWC1**-green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
