## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results suggest that **DWA1** controls drought resistance by regulating drought-induced cuticular wax deposition in rice.
   - Putative megaenzyme **DWA1** plays essential roles in drought resistance by regulating stress-induced wax deposition in rice.
   - Here, we identified a rice gene Drought-Induced Wax Accumulation 1 (**DWA1**) encoding a very large protein (2,391 aa in length) containing multiple enzymatic structures, including an oxidoreductase-like domain; a prokaryotic nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like module, including an AMP-binding domain; and an allene oxide synthase-like domain.
   - A **DWA1** KO mutant was highly sensitive to drought stress relative to the WT.
   - **DWA1** was preferentially expressed in vascular tissues and epidermal layers and strongly induced by drought stress.
   - The **DWA1** mutant was impaired in cuticular wax accumulation under drought stress, which significantly altered the cuticular wax composition of the plant, resulting in increased drought sensitivity.
   - The expression of many wax-related genes was significantly suppressed in **DWA1** under drought conditions.
