## Functional Descriptions:
   - We characterized the function of two rice phosphate (Pi) transporters: OsPHT1;9 (OsPT9) and **OsPht1;10** (OsPT10).
   - Conversely, although no alterations in Pi concentration were found in OsPT9 or **OsPT10** knockdown plants, a significant reduction in Pi concentration in both shoots and roots was observed in double-knockdown plants grown under both high- and low-Pi conditions.
   - Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and **OsPT10** was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters.
   - OsPT9 and **OsPT10** were expressed in the root epidermis, root hairs and lateral roots, with their expression being specifically induced by Pi starvation.
   - High-affinity Km values for Pi transport of OsPT9 and **OsPT10** were determined by yeast experiments and two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of anion transport in Xenopus oocytes expressing OsPT9 and **OsPT10**.
   - Pi uptake and Pi concentrations in transgenic plants harbouring overexpressed OsPT9 and **OsPT10** were determined by Pi concentration analysis and (33) P-labelled Pi uptake rate analysis.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that OsPT9 and **OsPT10** redundantly function in Pi uptake.
   - Phosphate transporters OsPHT1;9 and **OsPht1;10** are involved in phosphate uptake in rice.
