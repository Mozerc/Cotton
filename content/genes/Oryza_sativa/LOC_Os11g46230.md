- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A pollen-expressed gene from rice, **OsPCBP**, that was previously cloned and identified encodes a novel calmodulin-binding protein.
   - Our experimental results provide convincing evidence that **OsPCBP** protein plays an important role during the late stage of pollen development.
   - Cytological observations at different stages revealed that microspores from the **OsPCBP** double-stranded RNA interference plants developed normally until the binucleate stage, but about half were later aborted.
   - Overexpression of **OsPCBP** in transgenic rice plants did not lead to phenotypic changes but did delay anther formation by about 1 week.
