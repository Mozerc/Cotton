## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results suggest that **OsRMC** of the DUF26 subfamily involved in JA signal transduction mediates root development and negatively regulates root curling in rice.
   - Among these, we have chosen **OsRMC** to study its transcriptional regulation in rice seedlings subjected to high salinity.
   - To investigate how **OsRMC** is regulated in response to high salinity, a salt-induced rice cDNA expression library was constructed and subsequently screened using the yeast one-hybrid system and the **OsRMC** promoter as bait.
   - The results show that knocking down the expression level of **OsRMC** in transgenic rice led to insensitive seed germination, enhanced growth inhibition, and improved salt stress tolerance to NaCl than in untransgenic plants.
   - **OsRMC**, a negative regulator of salt stress response in rice, is regulated by two AP2/ERF transcription factors.
   - Thus, this gene was renamed Oryza sativa root meander curling (**OsRMC**).
   - Here, we evaluated the role of a previously clarified gene encoding a receptor-like protein from rice, **OsRMC**, in the regulation of Fe acquisition by comparing Fe concentration, biomass, and expression patterns of genes associated with Fe mobilization and transport in wild-type (WT) rice with those in **OsRMC** overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown transgenic rice plants.
   - sativa root meander curling (**OsRMC**), has shown drastically increased abundance in response to salt stress during the initial phase.
   - **OsRMC** RNA interference transgenic rice has been generated to assess the function of **OsRMC** in the salt stress response.
   - Here, we describe a JA-induced putative receptor-like protein (**OsRLK**, AAL87185) functioning in root development in rice.
   - Expression of **OsRMC** was upregulated in both shoots and roots upon exposure of WT to Fe-deficient medium.
   - Expression levels of **OsRMC** were positively correlated with Fe concentration in rice plants under both Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions such that overexpression and RNAi lines had higher and lower Fe concentration in both roots and shoots than WT plants, respectively.
   - **OsRMC** may also play a role in regulation of Fe deficiency-induced changes in root growth, as evidenced by greater and smaller root systems of **OsRMC** overexpression lines and RNAi lines than WT under Fe-deficient conditions, respectively.
   - These novel findings highlight an important role of **OsRMC** played in mediation of Fe acquisition and root growth in rice, particularly under Fe-deficient conditions.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **OsRMC** conferred greater accumulation of Fe in mature seeds under Fe-sufficient conditions.
   - **OsRMC** encodes a receptor-like kinase described as a negative regulator of salt stress responses in rice.
   - Remarkably, knockdown and overexpression of **OsRMC** reduced and enhanced rice defense against M.
   - oryzae, respectively, demonstrating that inhibition of CBM1-containing fungal enzymes by **OsRMC** is crucial for rice defense.
   - Here, we show that the rice cysteine-rich repeat secretion protein **OsRMC** binds to and inhibits xylanase MoCel10A of the blast fungus pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, interfering with its access to the rice cell wall and degradation of rice xylan.
