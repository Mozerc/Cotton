- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsCKX3</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Phenotypic analysis showed that rice **OsCKX3** mutants had smaller leaf angles, while the overexpression lines (**OsCKX3**-OE) had larger leaf angles.
   - Histological sections indicated that the leaf inclination changes in the **OsCKX3** and **OsCKX3**-OE lines resulted from asymmetric proliferation of the cells and vascular bundles in the lamina joint.
   - Interestingly, agronomic trait analysis of the rice grown in the paddy field indicated that **OsCKX3** displayed a smaller leaf angle and enhanced primary branch number, grain size, 1,000-grain weight, and flag leaf size.
   - Collectively, our results revealed that enhancing CK levels in the lamina joint by disrupting **OsCKX3** negatively regulates leaf angle, highlighting that the CK pathway can be engineered to reduce leaf angle in rice and possibly in other cereals.
   - Reverse transcription quantitative PCR, promoter-fused Î²-glucuronidase expression, and subcellular localization assays indicated that **OsCKX3** was highly expressed in the lamina joint, and **OsCKX3**-GFP fusion protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.
