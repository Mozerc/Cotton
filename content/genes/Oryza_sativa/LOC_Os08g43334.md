- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0546800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0546800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsHsfB2b</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results suggest that **OsHsfB2b** functions as a negative regulator in response to drought and salt stresses in rice, with its existing B3 repression domain (BRD) that might be necessary for the repressive activity.
   - Expression of **OsHsfB2b** was strongly induced by heat, salt, abscisic acid (ABA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments but was almost not affected by cold stress.
   - KEY MESSAGE: Expression of **OsHsfB2b** was strongly induced by heat, salt, ABA and PEG treatments.
   - Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased by **OsHsfB2b** overexpression, but were enhanced by RNA interference.
   - Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased in **OsHsfB2b**-overexpressing transgenic rice, but were enhanced in the **OsHsfB2b**-RNAi transgenic rice.
   - Heat shock factor **OsHsfB2b** negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice.
   - Under drought stress, the **OsHsfB2b**-overexpressing transgenic rice exhibited increased relative electrical conductivity (REC) and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased proline content compared with the wild type, while the lower REC and MDA content and increased proline content were found in the **OsHsfB2b**-RNAi transgenic rice.
