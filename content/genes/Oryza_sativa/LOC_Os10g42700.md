## Functional Descriptions:
   - Regulation of Drought and Salt Tolerance by **OsSKL2** and OsASR1 in Rice.
   - **OsSKL2** was localized in the chloroplast, and its transcripts were significantly induced by drought and salinity stress as well as H(2)O(2) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
   - Meanwhile, overexpression of **OsSKL2** in rice increased tolerance to salinity, drought and oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activity, and reducing levels of H(2)O(2), malondialdehyde, and relative electrolyte leakage.
   - Moreover, **OsSKL2** was found to physically interact with OsASR1, a well-known chaperone-like protein, which also exhibited positive roles in salt and drought tolerance.
   - Taken together, these findings suggest that **OsSKL2** together with OsASR1 act as important regulatory factors that confer salt and drought tolerance in rice via ROS scavenging.
   - In contrast, RNAi-induced suppression of **OsSKL2** increased sensitivity to stress treatment.
   - Interestingly, overexpression of **OsSKL2** also increased sensitivity to exogenous ABA, with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation.
