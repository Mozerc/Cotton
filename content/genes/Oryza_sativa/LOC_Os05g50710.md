- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression levels of **OsLEA5** in the roots and panicles of full ripe stage were dramatically increased.
   - coli cells producing **OsLEA5** fusion protein exhibited improved resistance against diverse abiotic stresses: high salinity, osmotic, freezing, heat, and UV radiation.
   - The **OsLEA5** protein confers stabilization of the LDH under different abiotic stresses, such as heating, freeze-thawing, and drying in vitro.
   - The combined results indicated that **OsLEA5** protein was a hydrophobic atypical LEA and closely associated with resistance to multiple abiotic stresses.
   - Molecular characterization and functional analysis by heterologous expression in E. coli under diverse abiotic stresses for **OsLEA5**, the atypical hydrophobic LEA protein from Oryza sativa L.
   - The ascorbate peroxidase APX1 is a direct target of a zinc finger transcription factor ZFP36 and a late embryogenesis abundant protein **OsLEA5** interacts with ZFP36 to co-regulate OsAPX1 in seed germination in rice.
   - The seed germination is highly inhibited in ZFP36 overexpression plants under ABA treatment, while an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of **OsLEA5** rice seeds were less sensitive to ABA, and exogenous ASC (ascorbate acid) could alleviate the inhibition induced by ABA.
   - Thus, our conclusion is that OsAPX1 is a direct target of ZFP36 and **OsLEA5** could interact with ZFP36 to co-regulate ABA-inhibited seed germination by controlling the expression of OsAPX1.
   - Hence, our conclusion is that **OsLEA5** participates in the ABA-mediated antioxidant defense to function in drought and salt stress response in rice, and 5C subgroup of LEAs contribute to play co-regulators of the transcription factor ZFP36.
   - **OsLEA5** acts as a co-regulator of a transcriptional factor ZFP36 to enhance the expression and the activity of ascorbate peroxidase OsAPX1 to regulate seed germination in rice, but it it unknown whether **OsLEA5** is also crucial in plant seedlings under stress conditions.
   - An Atypical Late Embryogenesis Abundant Protein **OsLEA5** Plays A Positive Role In ABA-Induced Antioxidant Defense In Oryza Sativa L.
   - Further investigation found that various stimulus and ABA could induce **OsLEA5** expression, and **OsLEA5** played downstream of ZFP36 to be involved in ABA-induced generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the regulation of the expression and the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes in plants leaves, and **OsLEA5** contributed to stabilize ZFP36.
   - We found that overexpression of **OsLEA5** in rice plants enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt stress; in contrast, an RNA interference (RNAi) mutant of **OsLEA5** rice plants were more sensitive to drought and salinity.
   - Additionally, **OsLEA5** participates in the accumulation of ABA by upregulating ABA-biosynthesis genes and downregulating ABA-metabolism genes.
   - Moreover, we found two homologue of **OsLEA5** (5C700, short for Os05g0526700 and 5C300, short for Os05g0584300) which were induced by ABA also interacted with ZFP36 separately; interestingly, the nucleus-located 5C700 could also act as a co-activator of ZFP36 to modulate OsAPX1 while 5C300 which was ABA-induced downexpressed played as an ABA-induced inhibitor of ZFP36 to regulate OsAPX1.
   - Overexpression of rice **OsLEA5** relieves the deterioration in seed quality caused by high-temperature stress.
   - RNAi knockdown line of **OsLEA5** showed decreased seed weight.
   - Transformant lines overexpressing **OsLEA5** exhibited improved quality and seed weight of mature seeds when they were developed under high-temperature conditions, while seed quality strongly declined in wild-type plants exposed to high-temperature stress.
   - These findings indicate that **OsLEA5** contributes to suppressing the deterioration of seed quality when developed under high-temperature conditions.
   - **OsLEA5** (Lea14A) interacts with a regulator of the endosperm storage production, FLO2, suggesting that **OsLEA5** may be involved in endosperm quality control.
