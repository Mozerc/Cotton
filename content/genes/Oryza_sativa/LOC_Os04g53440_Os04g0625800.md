## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os04g53440](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g53440)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0625800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0625800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** RBP-L
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptome analysis showed that **RBP-L** knockdown greatly affected the expression of prolamine family genes and several classes of transcription factors.
   - Moreover, distinct from RBP-P, **RBP-L** exhibits additional regulatory roles in development, either directly through its binding to corresponding RNAs or indirectly through its effect on transcription factors.
   - Reduced amounts of **RBP-L** caused partial mislocalization of glutelin and prolamine RNAs and conferred other general growth defects, including dwarfism, late flowering, and smaller seeds.
