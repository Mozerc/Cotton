- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0567400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0567400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsCAO1,PGL
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - This study characterizes a rice mutant, pale green leaf (**PGL**), and isolates the gene **PGL** by using a map-based cloning approach.
   - Compared with wild-type plants, **PGL** exhibits a lower Chl content with a reduced and disorderly thylakoid ultrastructure, which decreases the photosynthesis rate and results in reduced grain yield and quality.
   - Moreover, **PGL** is sensitive to heat stress.
   - In addition, **PGL** exhibits premature senescence in both natural and dark-induced conditions and more severe Chl degradation and reactive oxygen species accumulation than does the wild-type.
   - Thus, knockout of **OsCAO1** influenced growth period, leaf development and grain quality characters of rice.
   - Overall, the result suggests that **OsCAO1** also plays important roles in chlorophyll degradation and ROS scavenging to regulate both natural and induced rice senescence.
   - In this study, the development of edited lines with pale green leaves by knockout of **OsCAO1** gene known as a chlorophyll synthesis process is reported.
