## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, **OsZIP4** transcripts were detected in the meristem of Zn-deficient roots and shoots.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the **OsZIP4** gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were produced.
   - The Zn concentration in seeds of 35S-**OsZIP4** plants was four times lower compared with vector controls.
   - The Zn concentration in roots of 35S-**OsZIP4** transgenic plants was 10 times higher than in those of vector controls, but it was five times lower in shoots.
   - Northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed transcripts of **OsZIP4** expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in roots and shoots of 35S-**OsZIP4** plants, but levels of endogenous **OsZIP4** transcripts were low in roots and high in shoots compared with vector controls.
   - Microarray analysis revealed that the genes expressed in shoots of 35S-**OsZIP4** plants coincided with those induced in shoots of Zn-deficient plants.
   - Microarray and northern blot analysis revealed that **OsZIP4** was highly expressed under conditions of Zn deficiency in roots and shoots.
   - Real-time-PCR revealed that the **OsZIP4** transcripts were more abundant than those of OsZIP1 or OsZIP3 in Zn-deficient roots and shoots.
   - In situ hybridization analysis revealed that **OsZIP4** in Zn-deficient rice was expressed in shoots and roots, especially in phloem cells.
   - Overexpression of the **OsZIP4** zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants.
   - **OsZIP4** is a Zn transporter that localizes to apical cells.
   - These results indicate that constitutive expression of **OsZIP4** changes the Zn distribution within rice plants, and that **OsZIP4** is a critical Zn transporter that must be strictly regulated.
   - Four distinct genes, **OsZIP4**, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated.
   - **OsZIP4** complemented a Zn-uptake-deficient yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant, Deltazrt1,Deltazrt2, indicating that **OsZIP4** is a functional transporter of Zn.
   - These results suggested that **OsZIP4** is a Zn transporter that may be responsible for the translocation of Zn within rice plants.
   - **OsZIP4**, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice.
   - Immunostaining analysis revealed that **OsZIP4** was mainly expressed in phloem of diffuse vascular bundles (DVBs) in the nodes and the axillary meristem.
   - Mutation of **OsZIP4** did not affect the total Zn uptake, but altered Zn distribution; less Zn was delivered to TB and new leaf, but more Zn was retained in the basal stems at the vegetative growth stage.
   - At the reproductive stage, mutation of **OsZIP4** resulted in delayed panicles development, which is associated with decreased Zn distribution to the panicles.
   - Collectively, **OsZIP4** is involved in transporting Zn to the phloem of DVBs in the nodes for subsequent distribution to TBs and other developing tissues.
