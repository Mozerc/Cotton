## Functional Descriptions:
   - In addition, **OsOAT**-overexpressing plants showed significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress.
   - An ornithine delta-aminotransferase gene **OsOAT** confers drought and oxidative stress tolerance in rice.
   - We confirmed that **OsOAT** is a direct target of the stress-responsive NAC transcription factor SNAC2.
   - Overexpression of **OsOAT** caused significantly increased delta-OAT activity and Pro accumulation under normal growth conditions.
   - Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways contributed to the drought-induced expression of **OsOAT**.
   - Overexpression of the **OsOAT** gene in rice resulted in significantly enhanced drought and osmotic stress tolerance.
   - **OsOAT** is responsive to multiple stresses and phytohormone treatments.
   - In the **OsOAT** mutant, metabolic abnormality induced by nitrogen deficiency in floret causes malformed glumes, incapable glume opening and anther indehiscence.
   - Therefore, **OsOAT** is crucial for nitrogen reutilization and plays a critical role in floret development and seed setting in rice.
   - **OsOAT** mutant was identified as a temperature-sensitive male sterile mutant with deformed floral organs and seedlings sensitive to cold stress.
   - Ornithine 未-aminotransferase **OsOAT** is critical for male fertility and cold tolerance during rice plant development..
   - Moreover, indica varieties carrying WYG-type **OsOAT** generally have higher seed-setting rates than those carrying HHZ-type **OsOAT** under cold stress at reproductive stage, highlighting the favorable selection for WYG-type **OsOAT** during domestication and breeding to cope with low temperatures.
   - Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that **OsOAT** mutation and cold treatment of the wild-type plant led to similar changes in the global gene expression profiles in anthers.
   - **OsOAT** genes in indica rice Huanghuazhan (HHZ) and japonica rice Wuyungeng (WYG) are different in gene structure and response to cold.
