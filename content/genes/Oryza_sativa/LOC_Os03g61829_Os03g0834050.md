## Functional Descriptions:
   - Exogenous application of recombinant **OsHAD1** protein in growth media supplemented with phytate, led to marked increase in growth and total P content of Pi deficient WT rice seedlings.
   - Further, overexpression of **OsHAD1** in rice resulted in enhanced phosphatase activity, biomass, total and soluble P content in Pi deficient transgenic seedlings treated with phytate as restricted Pi source.
   - We conclude that besides dephosphorylation of cellular organic-P, **OsHAD1** in coordination with kinases may regulate phosphorylation status of downstream targets to accomplish Pi homeostasis under limited Pi supply.
   - Here, we identified and characterized a PHR2 regulated; novel low Pi responsive haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase, **OsHAD1**.
   - While, **OsHAD1** is a functional HAD protein having both acid phosphatase and phytase activity; it showed little homology with other known low Pi responsive HAD superfamily members.
   - To elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of **OsHAD1**, we performed in-vitro pull down assays which revealed association of **OsHAD1** with protein kinases.
