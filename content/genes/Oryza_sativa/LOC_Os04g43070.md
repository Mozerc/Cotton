## Functional Descriptions:
   - The NH4(+) uptake of roots is mainly governed by membrane transporters, with **OsAMT1;1** being a prominent member of the OsAMT1 gene family that is known to be involved in NH4(+) transport in rice plants.
   - A transgenic approach was undertaken to investigate the role of a rice ammonium transporter (**OsAMT1.1**) in ammonium uptake and consequent ammonium assimilation under different nitrogen regimes.
   - **OsAMT1;1** also enhanced overall plant growth, especially under suboptimal NH4(+) levels.
   - These results suggest that **OsAMT1;1** has the potential for improving nitrogen use efficiency, plant growth, and grain yield under both suboptimal and optimal nitrogen fertilizer conditions.
   - Gene expression analysis of members of ammonium transporter gene family in flag leaves during active grain filling stage revealed that all the three members of OsAMT3 family genes (**OsAMT1;1**-3), only one member of OsAMT2 family i.
   - To study the regulation of ammonium uptake into rice roots, three ammonium transporter genes (**OsAMT1;1**, 1;2 and 1;3; Oryza sativa ammonium transporter) were isolated and examined.
   - Northern blot analysis showed a distinct expression pattern for the three genes; more constitutive expression in shoots and roots for **OsAMT1;1**, root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2, and root-specific and nitrogen-derepressible expression for OsAMT1;3.
   - In both the genotypes, both increase and decline in seed protein contents matched with the expressions levels of **OsAMT1;1**, OsGS1;1 and OsGS1;2 in the flag leaves during grain filling stage indicating that high nitrogen nutrition in KN3119 probably causes the repression of these genes which might be important during grain filling.
   - CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at **OsAMT1;1** in rice was caused by a selective sweep around **OsAMT1;1**, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice.
   - **OsAMT1;1** is a high-affinity ammonium transporter in rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - rufipogon on either side of the promoter of **OsAMT1;1**, demonstrating a strong natural selection within or nearby the ammonium transporter.
   - The three members of the rice OsAMT1 gene family of ammonium transporters show distinct expression patterns; constitutive and ammonium-promoted expression in shoots and roots for **OsAMT1;1**; root-specific and ammonium-inducible expression for OsAMT1;2; root-specific and nitrogen-repressible expression for OsAMT1;3 [Sonoda et al.
   - This study shows that **OsAMT1;1** is a constitutively expressed, nitrogen-responsive gene, and its protein product is localized in the plasma membrane.
   - , OsAMT2;3 and the high affinity **OsAMT1;1** were differentially expressed and were affected by different doses of nitrogen.
   - Distinct expression and function of three ammonium transporter genes (**OsAMT1;1**-1;3) in rice.
   - Transgenic rice lines (L-2 and L-3) overexpressing the **OsAMT1;1** gene had the same root structure as the wild type (WT).
   - Ammonium application to roots following a period of nitrogen starvation induced accumulation of **OsAMT1;1** and OsAMT1;2 mRNA, but a decrease of OsAMT1;3 mRNA levels.
   - The expression patterns of the three genes showed good correlation (positive in **OsAMT1;1** and OsAMT1;2, negative in OsAMT1;3) with the root tissue contents of glutamine but not of ammonium.
   - Over-expression of the rice **OsAMT1.1** gene increases ammonium uptake and content, but impairs growth and development of plants under high ammonium nutrition.
   - Inhibition of yeast growth or currents elicited from oocytes by ammonium assimilation inhibitor L-methionine sulfoximine indicates that NH4 (+) transport by **OsAMT1;1** is likely feedback regulated by accumulation of the substrate.
   - Our results show that **OsAMT1;1** is a NH4 (+) transporter with relatively lower affinity to NH4 (+) (110-129 μM in oocytes and yeast cells, respectively).
   - In addition, effects of phosphorylation inhibitors imply that NH4 (+) uptake by **OsAMT1;1** is also modulated by tyrosine-specific protein kinase or calcium-regulated serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase involved phosphorylation processes.
   - The **OsAMT1.1** gene functions in ammonium uptake and ammonium-potassium homeostasis over low and high ammonium concentration ranges.
   - Spatial expression analysis showed that the upregulated expression of **OsAMT1;1** and OsAMT1;2 and downregulated expression of OsAMT1;3 by ammonium were higher in the root mature region than in the root tips.
   - Upon exposure to ammonium, localization of **OsAMT1;1** and OsAMT1;2 was also observed in the endoplasmic reticulum, but their abundance in the plasma membrane was not changed.
   - **OsAMT1;1** and OsAMT1;2 Coordinate Root Morphological and Physiological Responses to Ammonium for Efficient Nitrogen Foraging in Rice.
   - The two independent double mutants (dko) defective in **OsAMT1;1** and OsAMT1;2 failed to induce NH4+ uptake and stimulate LR formation, suggesting that OsAMT1s conferred the substrate-dependent root NH4+ foraging.
