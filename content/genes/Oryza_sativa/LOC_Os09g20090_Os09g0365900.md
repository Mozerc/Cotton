## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os09g20090](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os09g20090)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os09g0365900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os09g0365900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsORAP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - It was localized in the apoplast as shown by transient expression of an **OsORAP1**/GFP fusion construct in tobacco leaf epidermal and mesophyll cells, but did not possess AO activity as shown by heterologous expression of **OsORAP1** in Arabidopsis mutants with reduced background AO activity.
   - A knock-out (KO) rice line of **OsORAP1** showed enhanced tolerance to ozone stress (120 nL L-1 average daytime concentration, 20 days) as demonstrated by less formation of leaf visible symptoms (= cell death), less lipid peroxidation, and lower NADPH oxidase activity, indicating reduced active production of reactive oxygen species.
   - A novel gene **OsORAP1** enhances cell death in ozone stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - These observations suggested that **OsORAP1** specifically induced cell death in ozone stress.
   - These pieces of evidence suggested that **OsORAP1** enhanced cell death in ozone stress, and its expression levels could explain the effect of a previously reported QTL.
