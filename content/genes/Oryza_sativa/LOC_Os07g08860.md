## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results indicate that **OsSIK2** may integrate stress signals into a developmental program for better adaptive growth under unfavorable conditions.
   - Here, we report that **OsSIK2**, an S-domain receptor-like kinase from rice (Oryza sativa), is involved in abiotic stress and the senescence process.
   - An S-domain receptor-like kinase, **OsSIK2**, confers abiotic stress tolerance and delays dark-induced leaf senescence in rice.
   - Transgenic plants overexpressing **OsSIK2** and mutant sik2 exhibit enhanced and reduced tolerance to salt and drought stress, respectively, compared with the controls.
   - Interestingly, a truncated version of **OsSIK2** without most of the extracellular region confers higher salt tolerance than the full-length **OsSIK2**, likely through the activation of different sets of downstream genes.
   - The downstream PR-related genes specifically up-regulated by full-length **OsSIK2** or the DREB-like genes solely enhanced by truncated **OsSIK2** are all induced by salt, drought, and dark treatments.
   - **OsSIK2** is expressed mainly in rice leaf and sheath and can be induced by NaCl, drought, cold, dark, and abscisic acid treatment.
   - Moreover, seedlings of **OsSIK2**-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibit early leaf development and a delayed dark-induced senescence phenotype, while mutant sik2 shows the opposite phenotype.
