- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - During seedling growth, **RGP1** expression was first observed 14 days after germination, reaching a maximum level between 28 and 42 days, and gradually decreased thereafter until 63 days when it attained the same level of expression as in 14-day-old seedlings.
   - Corn (Zea mays) contains a biochemically similar and structurally homologous **RGP1**, which has been thought (it now seems mistakenly) to function in starch synthesis.
   - Expression of **RGP1** was found to be markedly reduced throughout the growth period of both 5-azacytidine-induced dwarf plants and their progenies, relative to levels in untreated tall control plants.
   - These results suggest that expression of **RGP1** may be influenced, either directly or indirectly, by DNA methylation, and that the **RGP1** protein may play an important role in plant growth and development.
   - Along with other evidence, this suggests that **RGP1** is involved in synthesis of xyloglucan and possibly other hemicelluloses.
   - A reversibly glycosylated polypeptide (**RGP1**) possibly involved in plant cell wall synthesis: purification, gene cloning, and trans-Golgi localization.
   - A novel ras-related **RGP1** gene encoding a GTP-binding protein has reduced expression in 5-azacytidine-induced dwarf rice.
