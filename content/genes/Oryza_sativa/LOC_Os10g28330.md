## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ghd10 is orthologous to INDETERMINATE1 (ID1), which promotes flowering in maize (Zea mays) and is identical to the previously cloned genes Rice Indeterminate1 (RID1), Early heading date2 (**Ehd2**) and OsId1.
   - Here, we show that the Rice Indeterminate 1 (**RID1**) gene acts as the master switch for the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase.
   - This phenotype in the **Ehd2** mutants suggests that **Ehd2** is pivotal for the floral transition in rice.
   - In the first, **RID1** is controlling the phase transition and initiation of floral induction.
   - **RID1**, encoding a Cys2/His2-type zinc finger transcription factor, acts as a master switch from vegetative to floral development in rice.
   - **RID1** encodes a Cys-2/His-2-type zinc finger transcription factor that does not have an ortholog in Arabidopsis spp.
   - A **RID1** knockout (**RID1**), mutated by T-DNA insertion, never headed after growing for >500 days under a range of growth conditions and is thus referred to as a never-flowering phenotype.
   - A model was proposed to place **RID1** in the molecular pathways of flowering regulation in rice, for which there are two indispensable elements.
   - Once the phase transition is induced with the activation of **RID1**, flowering signal is transduced and regulated through the various pathways and eventually integrated with FT-like proteins to induce flowering.
   - A point mutation in the zinc finger motif of RID1/**Ehd2**/OsID1 protein leads to outstanding yield-related traits in japonica rice variety Wuyunjing 7.
   - We discovered an early heading date2 (**Ehd2**) mutant that shows extremely late flowering under both short- and long-day conditions in line with a background deficient in Heading date1 (Hd1), a rice CONSTANS ortholog that belongs to the conserved pathway.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **Ehd2** encodes a putative transcription factor with zinc finger motifs orthologous to the INDETERMINATE1 (ID1) gene, which promotes flowering in maize (Zea mays).
   - To assign the position of **Ehd2** within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such as Ehd1, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT-like1 (RFT1; rice florigens), between the wild-type plants and the **Ehd2** mutants.
   - Severely reduced expression of these genes in **Ehd2** under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that **Ehd2** acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating Ehd1 and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice.
   - **Ehd2**, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1.
   - **Ehd2** mRNA in rice tissues accumulated most abundantly in developing leaves, but was present at very low levels around the shoot apex and in roots, patterns that are similar to those of ID1.
