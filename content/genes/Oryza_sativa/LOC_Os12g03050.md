## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g03050](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g03050)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0123800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0123800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ONAC300</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - High levels of **ONAC300** mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization in developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) and in the associated young leaves.
   - RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the levels of **ONAC300** transcripts were higher in leaves, roots and culms than in panicles.
   - Thus, **ONAC300** is a novel member of the NAC family which is expressed at very early developmental stages in the shoot, root and flower, as well as in the mature phloem of vascular tissues in rice.
   - The use of an **ONAC300**:: GUS reporter gene revealed that the **ONAC300** promoter was expressed predominantly in developing vascular tissues of the leaves and roots.
