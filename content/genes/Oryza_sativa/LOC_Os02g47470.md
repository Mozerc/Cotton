## Functional Descriptions:
   - Treatment of aerobic seedlings with ethylene and its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), rapidly induced the expression of **OsABA8ox1**, but the ethylene treatment did not strongly affect the expression of ABA biosynthetic genes.
   - Moreover, pre-treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), a potent inhibitor of ethylene action, partially suppressed induction of **OsABA8ox1** expression under submergence.
   - Together, these results indicate that the rapid decrease in ABA levels in submerged rice shoots is controlled partly by ethylene-induced expression of **OsABA8ox1** and partly by ethylene-independent suppression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of ABA.
   - Ethylene promotes submergence-induced expression of **OsABA8ox1**, a gene that encodes ABA 8'-hydroxylase in rice.
   - The oxidation of ABA to PA is catalyzed by ABA 8'-hydroxylase, which is possibly encoded by three genes (**OsABA8ox1**, -2 and -3) in rice.
   - The ABA 8'-hydroxylase activity was confirmed in microsomes from yeast expressing **OsABA8ox1**.
   - The ABA level was found to be negatively correlated with **OsABA8ox1** expression under ACC or 1-MCP treatment.
   - The mRNA level of **OsABA8ox1**, but not the mRNA levels of other OsABA8ox genes, increased dramatically within 1 h after submergence.
