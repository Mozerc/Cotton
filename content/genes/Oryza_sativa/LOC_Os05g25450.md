- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0318700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0318700)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FLR3</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knockouts of **FLR3** and/or FLR14 increased the number of white-core grains caused by aberrant accumulation of storage substances, resulting in poor grain quality.
   - Conversely, the overexpression of **FLR3** or FLR14 reduced grain chalkiness and improved grain quality.
   - We also demonstrated that **FLR3** and FLR14 reduced grain chalkiness by alleviating heat-induced oxidative stress in rice endosperm.
   - Transcriptome and metabolome analyses showed that genes and metabolites involved in the oxidative stress response were significantly up-regulated in **FLR3** and flr14 grains.
   - The content of reactive oxygen species was significantly increased in **FLR3** and flr14 mutant endosperm but decreased in overexpression lines.
