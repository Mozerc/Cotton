## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** Rf98;PPR762
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we identified seven pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) genes that are located within a 170 kb region as candidates for Rf98 Complementation tests revealed that the introduction of one of these PPR genes, **PPR762**, resulted in the partial recovery of fertility with a seed setting rate up to 9.
   - The low rate of seed setting suggested that some other genes near the **Rf98** locus are also necessary for the full recovery of seed setting.
   - Fine mapping of **Rf98** revealed that at least two genes, which are closely positioned, are required for complete fertility restoration in RT98A.
