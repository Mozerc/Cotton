## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we performed functional analysis of a rice (Oryza sativa) S1P lyase gene **OsSPL1** in transgenic tobacco plants and explored its possible involvement in abiotic stress response.
   - Our results suggest that rice **OsSPL1** plays an important role in abiotic stress responses.
   - Overexpression of **OsSPL1** in transgenic tobacco resulted in enhanced sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and decreased tolerance to salt and oxidative stress, when compared with the wild type.
   - Furthermore, the expression levels of some selected stress-related genes in **OsSPL1**-overexpressing plants were reduced after application of salt or oxidative stress, indicating that the altered responsiveness of stress-related genes may be responsible for the reduced tolerance in **OsSPL1**-overexpressing tobacco plants under salt and oxidative stress.
   - Overexpression of rice sphingosine-1-phoshpate lyase gene **OsSPL1** in transgenic tobacco reduces salt and oxidative stress tolerance.
   - Molecular characterization of rice sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase gene **OsSPL1** and functional analysis of its role in disease resistance response.
   - Our results indicate that overexpression of **OsSPL1** in transgenic tobacco plants attenuated disease resistance and facilitated programmed cell death.
   - Expression of **OsSPL1** was down-regulated in rice plants after treatments with salicylic acid, benzothiadiazole and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, but was induced by infection with a virulent strain of Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease.
   - Transgenic tobacco lines with overexpression of **OsSPL1** were generated and analyzed for the possible role of **OsSPL1** in disease resistance response and PCD.
   - Our results suggest that **OsSPL1** has different functions in regulating disease resistance response and PCD in plants.
   - Molecular characterization of rice sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase gene **OsSPL1** and  functional analysis of its role in disease resistance response.
