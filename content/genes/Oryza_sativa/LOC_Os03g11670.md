- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Disruption of **OsPPR676** resulted in growth retardation of plants and partial sterility of pollens.
   - In this study, **OsPPR676** was confirmed to be an interacted protein with Osj10gBTF3, β-subunit of nascent polypeptide-associated complex (β-NAC), by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, indicating that both proteins are probably involved in the same regulatory pathway of pollen development.
   - Compared with other chloroplast-rich tissues, **OsPPR676** was only weakly expressed in anther, but in the Mei and YM stages of pollen development, its expression was relatively strong in the tapetum.
   - **OsATP4** mutants were chlorotic and had a plastid-ribosome deficiency when grown in the cold.
   - Expression of the edited rps8 isoform in transgenic **OsATP4** mutants complemented the cold-sensitive phenotype, indicating that a rps8 expression defect accounts for the cold sensitivity.
