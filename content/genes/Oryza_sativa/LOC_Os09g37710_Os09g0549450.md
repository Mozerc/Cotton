## Functional Descriptions:
   - We found that **OsNLP4** transactivated OsNiR encoding nitrite reductase that was critical in nitrogen assimilation in rice.
   - In contrast, the **OsNLP4** overexpression lines remarkably increased yield by 30% and NUE by 47% under moderate N level compared with wild type.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **OsNLP4** can recover the phenotype of Arabidopsis nlp7 mutant and enhance its biomass.
   - In recent years, NIN-like proteins (NLPs) have been described as key transcription factors of nitrogen responses in Arabidopsis thaliana, which implies that **OsNLP4** is involved in the regulation of nitrate assimilation and nitrogen use efficiency in rice.
   - Growth and nitrate reductase activity are impaired in rice **OsNLP4** mutantssupplied with nitrate.
   - Here, we show that **OsNLP4** can influence plant growth by affecting nitrate reductase (NR) activity.
   - The growth of **OsNLP4** knockdown mutants was reduced when nitrate was supply, but not when ammonium was supply.
   - We propose that, in addition to the regulation of gene expression within the nitrate signaling pathway, **OsNLP4** can affect the NR activity and nitrate-dependent growth of rice.
   - Furthermore, the concentrations of iron and molybdenum, essential elements for NR activity, were reduced in **OsNLP4** knockdown mutants.
   - The nitrate concentration was significantly reduced in **OsNLP4** mutants.
   - Our results support a working model for the role of **OsNLP4** in the nitrate signaling pathway.
