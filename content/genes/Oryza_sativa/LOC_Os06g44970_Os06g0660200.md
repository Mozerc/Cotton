## Functional Descriptions:
   - The data suggest that **OsPIN2** has a distinct auxin-dependent regulation pathway together with OsPIN1b and OsTAC1 controlling rice shoot architecture.
   - The expression patterns of the auxin reporter DR5::GUS and quantification of auxin distribution showed that **OsPIN2** over-expression increased auxin transport from the shoot to the root-shoot junction, resulting in a non-tissue-specific accumulation of more free auxin at the root-shoot junction relative to WT.
   - Over-expression of **OsPIN2** enhanced auxin transport from shoots to roots, but did not alter the polar auxin pattern in the roots.
   - **OsPIN2**-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice.
   - Over-expression of **OsPIN2** leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1.
   - Altering **OsPIN2** expression by genetic transformation can be directly used for modifying rice architecture.
   - Overexpressing **OsPIN2** enhances aluminium internalization by elevating vesicular trafficking in rice root apex..
   - In this study, it was found that the rice **OsPIN2** overexpression line (OX1) had significantly reduced Al content in its cell wall and increased Al concentration in cell sap only in rice root tips relative to the wild-type (WT).
   - Taken together, the data indicate that endocytic vesicular trafficking might contribute to Al internalization, and that overexpressing **OsPIN2** enhances rice Al tolerance via elevated endocytic vesicular trafficking and Al internalization.
   - Overexpressing **OsPIN2** enhances aluminium internalization by elevating vesicular trafficking in rice root apex.
   - **OsPIN2** was shown to play an important role in mediating root gravitropic responses in rice and was essential for plants to produce normal RGAs.
   - Taken together, our findings suggest that **OsPIN2** plays an important role in root gravitropic responses and determining the root system architecture in rice by affecting polar auxin transport in the root tip.
   - **OsPIN2** was mainly expressed in roots and the base of shoots, and showed polar localization in the plasma membrane of root epidermal and cortex cells.
   - The **OsPIN2** gene encodes a member of the auxin-efflux carrier proteins that possibly regulates the basipetal auxin flow from the root tip towards the root-elongation zone.
   - Overexpression of **OsPIN2** Regulates Root Growth and Formation in Response to Phosphate Deficiency in Rice..
   - However, overexpression of **OsPIN2** caused a loss of sensitivity in the root response to P deficiency.
   - Compared to WT plants, overexpression of **OsPIN2** had a shorter root length through decreased root cell elongation under control and LP.
   - These results suggest that higher **OsPIN2** expression regulates rice root growth and development maybe by changing auxin distribution in roots under LP condition.
   - Surprisingly, overexpression of **OsPIN2** might increase auxin distribution in epidermis of root, resulting in greater RH formation but less LR development in OE plants than in WT plants in the control condition but levels similar of these under LP.
