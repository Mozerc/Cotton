## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of a New Zinc Finger Protein Transcription Factor **OsCTZFP8** Improves Cold Tolerance in Rice..
   - In the present study, we isolated and functionally characterized a new C2H2 zinc finger protein transcription factor **OsCTZFP8** in rice.
   - These results demonstrate that **OsCTZFP8** was a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor that plays an important role in cold tolerance in rice.
   - Transgenic rice overexpressing **OsCTZFP8** exhibited cold tolerant phenotypes with significantly higher pollen fertilities and seed setting rates than nontransgenic control plants.
   - Expression of **OsCTZFP8** was differentially induced by several abiotic stresses and was strongly induced by cold stress.
   - **OsCTZFP8** encodes a C2H2 zinc finger protein, which contains a typical zinc finger motif, as well as a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a leucine-rich region (L-box).
   - Subcellular localization assay and yeast one-hybrid analysis revealed that **OsCTZFP8** was a nuclear protein and has transactivation activity.
   - To characterize the function of **OsCTZFP8** in rice, the full-length cDNA of **OsCTZFP8** was isolated and transgenic rice with overexpression of **OsCTZFP8** driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter was generated using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.
