## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results strongly suggest that **OsYSL15** is the dominant iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter responsible for iron uptake from the rhizosphere and is also responsible for phloem transport of iron.
   - Rice **OsYSL15** is an iron-regulated iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid transporter expressed in the roots and is essential for iron uptake in early growth of the seedlings.
   - Expression of **OsYSL15** in root epidermis and stele was induced by iron deficiency and showed daily fluctuation.
   - **OsYSL15** restored a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when supplied with iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid and transported iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
   - **OsYSL15** promoter-beta-glucuronidase analysis revealed that **OsYSL15** expression in roots was dominant in the epidermis/exodermis and phloem cells under conditions of iron deficiency and was detected only in phloem under iron sufficiency.
   - **OsYSL15** knockdown seedlings showed severe arrest in germination and early growth and were rescued by high iron supply.
   - These results demonstrate that rice **OsYSL15** plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis during the early stages of growth.
   - Two insertional **OsYSL15** mutants exhibited chlorotic phenotypes under Fe deficiency and had reduced Fe concentrations in their shoots, roots, and seeds.
   - Overexpression of **OsYSL15** increased the Fe concentration in leaves and seeds from transgenic plants.
   - **OsYSL15** was also expressed in flowers, developing seeds, and in the embryonic scutellar epithelial cells during seed germination.
   - RNA interference of OsIRO2 in transgenic rice showed that ethylene acted via this transcription factor to induce the expression of OsNAS1, OsNAS2, **OsYSL15**, and OsIRT1.
   - The **OsYSL15** promoter fusion to beta-glucuronidase showed that it was expressed in all root tissues when Fe was limited.
   - We have characterized **OsYSL15**, one of the rice (Oryza sativa) YS1-like (YSL) genes that are strongly induced by iron (Fe) deficiency.
   - Disruption of **OsYSL15** leads to iron inefficiency in rice plants.
