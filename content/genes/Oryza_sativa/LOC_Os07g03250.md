## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, termed crown rootless5 (**Crl5**), which produced fewer crown roots and displayed impaired initiation of crown root primordia.
   - The expression of **Crl5**, which encodes a member of the large AP2/ERF transcription factor family protein, was observed in the stem region where crown root initiation occurs.
   - A putative auxin response element in the **Crl5** promoter region specifically interacted with a rice ARF, demonstrating that **Crl5** may be a direct target of an ARF, similar to CRL1/ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 (ARL1) that also regulates crown root initiation.
   - A crl1 **Crl5** double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, indicating that these two genes function in different genetic pathways for crown root initiation.
   - In addition, ProACT:**Crl5**/WT showed a cytokinin-resistant phenotype for crown root initiation, and also up-regulated the expression of two negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, OsRR1 and OsRR2, which were downregulated in **Crl5**.
   - Transgenic plants that over-expressed OsRR1 under the control of the **Crl5** promoter in a **Crl5** mutant background produced a higher number of crown roots than the **Crl5** plant.
   - Taken together, these results indicate that auxin-induced **Crl5** promotes crown root initiation through repression of cytokinin signaling by positively regulating type-A RR, OsRR1.
   - We have demonstrated that auxin-induced CROWN ROOTLESS5 (**Crl5**) regulates crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a negative regulator of cytokinin signaling.
   - A radicle initiated normally in a **Crl5** mutant, in spite of the defect in crown root initiation, whereas crown roots, but not a radicle, were produced in a radicleless1 (ral1) mutant.
   - Exogenous auxin treatment induced **Crl5** expression without de novo protein biosynthesis, which also required the degradation of AUX/IAA proteins.
   - **Crl5** overexpressing calli formed adventitious roots, although **Crl5** overexpressing plants did not induce ectopic roots, suggesting that **Crl5**, which promotes de novo root initiation, might function only in de-differentiated cells.
   - A **Crl5** ral1 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, showing that the formation of each root is regulated by different genetic mechanisms in rice.
