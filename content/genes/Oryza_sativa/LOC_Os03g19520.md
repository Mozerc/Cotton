## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we describe a **SRL2** (semi-rolled leaf2) rice mutant, which has incurved leaves due to the presence of defective sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of the leaf and displays narrow leaves and reduced plant height.
   - **SRL2** was mainly expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf blades, leaf sheaths, and roots, especially in their sclerenchymatous cells.
   - The transcriptional activities of several leaf development-related YABBY genes were significantly altered in the **SRL2** mutant.
   - Double mutant analysis suggested that **SRL2** and SHALLOT-LIKE1 (SLL1)/ROLLED LEAF9 (RL9) function in distinct pathways that regulate abaxial-side leaf development.
   - Hence, **SRL2** plays an important role in regulating leaf development, particularly during sclerenchymatous cell differentiation.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **SRL2** encodes a novel plant-specific protein of unknown biochemical function.
   - RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the development process was affected in **AVB**.
   - Our research shows that **AVB** is involved in the maintenance of the normal cell division pattern in lateral primordia development and that the **AVB** gene is required for procambium establishment following auxin signaling.
   - Map-based cloning and genetic complementation demonstrated that **AVB** encodes a land plant conserved protein with unknown functions.
   - Ploidy analysis and the inÂ situ expression patterns of histone H4 confirmed that cell proliferation was impaired during lateral primordia development, whereas procambium cells showed a greater ability to undergo cell division in **AVB**.
   - The **NRL2** protein interacted with Rolling-leaf (RL14), causing the leaves of the **NRL2** mutants to have a higher cellulose content and lower lignin content than the WT, which may have been related to sclerenchymatous cell differentiation and tapetum degeneration.
   - The mutation of **NRL2** caused pleiotropic effects, including a reduction in the number of longitudinal veins, defective abaxial sclerenchymatous cell differentiation, abnormal tapetum degeneration and microspore development, and the formation of more slender seeds compared with the wild type (WT).
   - In this study, we isolated and identified a narrow and rolled leaf mutant, temporarily named **NRL3** with darker green leaves.
   - Y2H and BIFC assays indicated that **NRL3** interacts directly with NAL9/VYL to regulate leaf morphology in rice.
   - Thus, **NRL3** plays an important role in leaf morphogenesis and chlorophyll accumulation, and can be used as a new gene resource for constructing improved rice.
   - Histological analysis showed that **NRL3** has a reduced number of vascular bundles and undergoes abnormal abaxial sclerenchymatous cell differentiation.
   - Expression analysis of **NRL3** showed that genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis were significantly up-regulated while those involved in chlorophyll degradation and programmed cell death (PCD) were significantly down-regulated.
   - **NRL3** is localized in cytoplasm, membrane and nucleus.
