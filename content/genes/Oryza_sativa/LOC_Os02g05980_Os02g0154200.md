## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our data showed that rice **LRK1** is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms.
   - The over-expression of rice **LRK1** results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27.
   - The functional characterization of rice **LRK1** facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops.
   - Over-expression of the rice **LRK1** gene improves quantitative yield components.
   - Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that **LRK1** restricts gibberellin biosynthesis during the internode elongation process by down-regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene coding for ent-kaurene oxidase.
   - Our data suggest that rice **LRK1** regulates rice branch number by enhancing cellular proliferation.
   - This study demonstrates a substantial natural variation of Rd in rice and that the **LRK1** gene can regulate leaf dark respiratory fluxes, especially under high temperature.
   - A rice **LRK1** mutant shows only ~37% Rd of that of WT and retarded growth following exposure to 35 <a1><e3>C for 30 days, but only 24% reduction in growth was recorded under normal temperature (25 <a1><e3>C).
   - Particularly, we observed that the **LRK1** gene, annotated as leucine rich repeat receptor kinase, was up-regulated four times.
