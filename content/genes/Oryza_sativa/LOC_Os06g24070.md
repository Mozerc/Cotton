## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using rice expression-microarray and northern blot analyses, we found that a large number of nucleus-encoded genes involved in chloroplast functions were highly expressed and transcripts of plastid-encoded genes, psaA, psbA and rbcL, increased in the **OsGLK1**-FOX calli.
   - Transmission electron microscopy showed the existence of differentiated chloroplasts with grana stacks in **OsGLK1**-FOX calli cells.
   - Furthermore, we found developed chloroplasts in vascular bundle and bundle sheath cells of coleoptiles and leaves from **OsGLK1**-FOX seedlings.
   - The **OsGLK1**-FOX calli exhibited high photosynthetic activity and were able to grow on sucrose-depleted media, indicating that developed chloroplasts in **OsGLK1**-FOX rice calli are functional and active.
   - These results strongly suggest that **OsGLK1** regulates chloroplast development under the control of light and phytohormones, and that it is a key regulator of chloroplast development.
   - Ectopic overexpression of the transcription factor **OsGLK1** induces chloroplast development in non-green rice cells.
   - In both lines, **OsGLK1** cDNA encoding a GARP transcription factor was ectopically overexpressed.
   - Our results revealed that **OsGLK1** confers favorable characters in rice endosperm and could help to refine strategies for the carotenoid and other plastid-synthesized micronutrient fortification in bioengineered plants.
   - A major resistance QTL was identified on chromosome 6 in rice variety Wuke; both overexpression and knockdown experiments confirmed that **OsGLK1** is the candidate gene for association with Rice black-streaked dwarf virus disease.
   - Furthermore, **OsGLK1** knockdown rice lines were investigated and the resistance ability was significantly declined without this gene compared to the wild type.
   - Taken together, both overexpression and knockdown experiments strongly suggested that **OsGLK1** plays an important role for RBSDV resistance and contributes to the major QTL.
   - The study paves the way for elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying RBSDVD resistance and the molecular markers associated with **OsGLK1** may be used for marker-assisted selection.
