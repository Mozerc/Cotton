## Functional Descriptions:
   - A role for AGO1 in rice antiviral immunity under natural infection conditions.
   - Overexpression of **OsAGO1b** Induces Adaxially Rolled Leaves by Affecting Leaf Abaxial Sclerenchymatous Cell Development in Rice.
   - The mRNA distribution patterns of OSHB3 and OsARF4 in leaves remained almost unchanged between ZH11 and **OsAGO1b** overexpression lines, but their expression levels were enhanced at the regions of vascular bundles and sclerenchymatous cell differentiation.
   - However, only up- and down-regulation of **OsAGO1b** caused multiple abnormal phenotypic changes in rice, indicating that **OsAGO1b** is the key player in rice growth and organ development compared with other three OsAGO1s.
   - In summary, we demonstrated **OsAGO1b** is the leading player among four OsAGO1s in rice growth and development.
   - Knockdown lines of **OsAGO1b** showed almost normal leaves, but the seed setting percentage was significantly reduced accompanied by the disturbed anther patterning and reduced pollen fertility.
   - Overexpression of **OsAGO1b** caused adaxially rolled leaves and a series of abnormal phenotypes, such as the reduced tiller number and plant height.
   - Further anatomical observation revealed that **OsAGO1b** overexpression plants showed the partially defective development of sclerenchymatous cells on the abaxial side of leaves.
   - In situ hybridization showed **OsAGO1b** mRNA was uniformly accumulated in P1 to P3 primordia without polarity property, suggesting **OsAGO1b** did not regulate the adaxial-abaxial polarity development directly.
   - **OsAGO1b** is a typical AGO protein, and co-localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm simultaneously.
