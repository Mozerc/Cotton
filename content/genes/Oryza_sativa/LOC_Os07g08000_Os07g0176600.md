- **Gene Symbol:** OsNek3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - On the other hand, plants overexpressing **OsNek3** occasionally produced a peculiar pollen structure in which the outer cell wall of four pollen grains fused together even at the mature pollen stages, which resembled that of quartet mutants in Arabidopsis.
   - **OsNek3** was preferentially expressed in mature pollen.
   - A knockout mutant with Tos17 inserted into **OsNek3** did not show any pollen-defective phenotype.
   - **OsNek3** was shown to interact with a LIM domain-containing protein, OsPLIM2b, whose expression was strongly specific in mature pollen, suggesting that **OsNek3** might play a role in pollen germination.
   - Cytoplasmic male sterility-related protein kinase, **OsNek3**, is regulated downstream of mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2C, DCW11.
   - These results suggest that **OsNek3** is downstream of DCW11 in retrograde signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus and is involved in CW-CMS.
