## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results indicate that both PLA1 and **PLA2** act downstream of the GA signal transduction pathway to regulate leaf development.
   - Here, we present a detailed analysis of plastochron2 (**PLA2**), a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant that exhibits shortened plastochron and precocious maturation of leaves during the vegetative phase and ectopic shoot formation during the reproductive phase.
   - We found that gibberellin (GA) is the major phytohormone that promotes PLA1 and **PLA2** expression.
   - Rice PLASTOCHRON 1 (PLA1) and **PLA2** genes regulate leaf maturation and plastochron, and their loss-of-function mutants exhibit small organs and rapid leaf emergence.
   - Here, we reported the characterization of the rice leafy-head2 (**LHD2**) mutant that exhibits shortened plastochron, dwarfism, reduced tiller number, and failure of phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth.
   - pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and **PLA2**- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase.
   - However, in contrast to pla1 and **PLA2**, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology.
   - GA induced PLA1 and **PLA2** expression, and conversely the GA-inhibitor uniconazole suppressed PLA1 and **PLA2** expression.
   - In pla1-4 and **PLA2**-1 seedlings, expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes and the signal transduction gene were similar to those in wild-type seedlings.
   - GA treatment slightly down-regulated the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox2 and up-regulated the GA-catabolizing gene GA2ox4, whereas the GA biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole up-regulated GA20ox2 and down-regulated GA2ox4 both in wild-type and pla mutants, suggesting that the GA feedback mechanism is not impaired in pla1 and **PLA2**.
   - To reveal how GA signal transduction affects the expression of PLA1 and **PLA2**, PLA expression in GA-signaling mutants was examined.
   - Anatomical and histological study revealed that the rapid emergence of leaves in **LHD2** was resulted from the rapid initiation of leaf primordia whereas the reduced tiller number was a consequence of the suppression of the tiller bud outgrowth.
   - Here, we investigated how PLA1 and **PLA2** genes are related to phytohormones.
   - **PLA2** is expressed predominantly in young leaf primordia.
   - We show that **PLA2** normally acts to retard the rate of leaf maturation but does so independently of PLA1, which encodes a member of the P450 family.
   - The similar phenotypes caused by **LHD2** mutation and the conserved expression pattern of **LHD2** indicated a conserved mechanism in controlling the temporal leaf initiation in grass.
   - Comparison of genome-scale expression profiles between wild-type and **LHD2** plants suggested that **LHD2** may regulate rice shoot development through KNOX and hormone-related genes.
