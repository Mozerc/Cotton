## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CHR729** Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice..
   - These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein **CHR729** plays an important role in many aspects of seedling development and controls this development via the gibberellin pathway.
   - **CHR729** encoded a nuclear protein and was expressed in almost all organs.
   - Realtime RT-PCR analysis showed that **CRL6** was most highly expressed in the stem base region where crown roots initiated.
   - Histological analysis showed that **CRL6** influences crown root formation by regulating primordial initiation and development.
   - Our results provide evidence that **CRL6** plays an important role in crown root development in rice via auxin-related signaling pathway.
   - In addition, auxin-action inhibited phenotype was observed during **CRL6** development.
   - Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation tests verified that the **CRL6** gene encodes a member of the large chromodomain, helicase/ATPase, and DNA-binding domain (CHD) family protein.
   - Our results suggest that **RFS** is required for many aspects of plant development and its function is closely associated with epigenetic regulation of genes that modulate ROS homeostasis.
