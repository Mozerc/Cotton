## Functional Descriptions:
   - Anther-preferential expressing gene **PMR** is essential for the mitosis of pollen development in rice.
   - When **PMR** gene was suppressed via RNAi, the mitosis of microspore was severely damaged, and the plants formed unmatured pollens containing only one or two nucleuses at the anthesis, ultimately leading to serious reduction of pollen fertility and seed-setting.
   - We finally discussed that unknown protein **PMR** contained the PHD, SWIB and Plus-3 domains and they might have coordinating functions in regulation pathway of the pollen mitosis in rice.
   - Phenotype identification, expression examination, and function prediction declared that the anther-preferential expressing gene **PMR** may participate in regulation of male gametophyte development in rice.
   - Further analysis revealed that **PMR** together with its co-expressing genes were liable to participate in the regulation of DNA metabolism in the nucleus, and affected the activities of some enzymes related to the cell cycle.
   - Here, we reported an anther-preferential expressing gene in rice, **PMR** (Pollen Mitosis Relative), playing an essential role in male gametogenesis.
