## Functional Descriptions:
   - No transcripts were found in leaf, stem, lemma/palea, ripening grain and florets before the uninucleate microspore developmental stage, but a large quantity of **OsUgp2** mRNA was found in pollen at the binucleate and mature stages.
   - **OsUgp2**, a rice UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene, has previously been shown to preferentially express in maturing pollens and plays an important role in pollen starch accumulation.
   - Northern blot and RNA in situ hybridization indicated that the expression of **OsUgp2** was preferentially in pollen and developmentally regulated.
   - The pollen fertility of 16 independent transgenic rice plants was found between 25% and 90%, which was correlated with the amount of **OsUgp2** mRNA.
   - These results demonstrated that **OsUgp2** is a pollen-preferential “late gene and plays a key role during pollen maturation, especially for starch accumulation.
   - **OsUgp2** complements OsUgp1 to fulfill the UGPase’s functions necessary for the full process of pollen development.
   - UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase2 (**OsUgp2**), a pollen-preferential gene in rice, plays a critical role in starch accumulation during pollen maturation.
   - In this study, a full-length cDNA of **OsUgp2** was isolated from rice anther.
   - Expressing a double-stranded RNA interference construct in Ugp1-RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both Ugp1 and **Ugp2**, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development.
