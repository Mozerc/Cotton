## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g18410](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g18410)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0282000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0282000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** MIR
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Growth in the **MIR** T-DNA knockout rice mutant (**MIR**) was significantly impaired compared to wild-type (WT) plants when grown under Fe-deficient or -sufficient conditions.
   - We cloned and characterized a mitochondrial iron-regulated (**MIR**) gene in rice involved in Fe homeostasis.
   - Rice-specific mitochondrial iron-regulated gene (**MIR**) plays an important role in iron homeostasis.
   - **MIR**, when expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells, was localized to the mitochondria.
   - These results clearly suggest that **MIR** is a rice-specific mitochondrial protein, recently evolved, and plays a significant role in Fe homeostasis.
   - **MIR** transcripts were greatly increased in response to Fe deficiency in roots and shoot tissue.
   - Furthermore, **MIR** plants accumulated more than twice the amount of Fe in shoot and root tissue compared to WT plants when grown under either Fe-sufficient or -deficient conditions.
   - Despite the high accumulation of Fe in roots and shoots, **MIR** plants triggered the expression of Fe-deficiency-inducible genes, indicating that **MIR** may not be able to utilize Fe for physiological functions.
