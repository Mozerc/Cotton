## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we identified and characterized a rolling and erect leaf mutant in rice and named it as **REL2**.
   - The results from quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that **REL2** functioning in the leaf shape formation might have functional linkage with many genes associated with the bulliform cells development, auxin synthesis and transport, etc.
   - **REL2** is the DUF domains contained protein which involves in the control of leaf rolling in rice.
   - We firstly mapped **REL2** to a 35-kb physical region of chromosome 10 by map-based cloning strategy.
   - Further studies showed that **REL2** protein is mainly distributed along the plasma membrane of cells and the **REL2** gene is relatively higher expressed in younger leaves of rice.
   - Here, we report a semi-dwarf and low tillering mutant **OsDLT10** (dwarf and low tillering 10) that exhibited reduced tiller number, semi-dwarfism, increased grain width, low seed-setting rate, curled leaf tip and a series of abnormalities of agronomic traits.
   - Expression pattern analysis indicated that **OsDLT10** was primarily expressed in the stem node, the basic part of axillary bud and leaf sheath, pulvinus.
   - Phenotypic observations showed that **OsDLT10** mutants had defects in tiller bud formation and grew slowly at the tillering stage.
   - Endogenous auxin content decreased significantly at the base of stem node and axillary bud in **OsDLT10** mutants.
   - The hormone treatment investigation indicated that extremely high of exogenous auxin concentrations can inhibit the expression of **OsDLT10**.
   - The results showed that **OsDLT10** was related to auxin.
   - These results revealed that **OsDLT10** played a critical role in influencing tiller number, likely in association with hormone signals and the WUS-CLV pathway, to regulate axillary bud development in rice.
   - This study characterized the functions of **RSD1** and OsSDD1 in rice stomatal development.
   - OsSDD1 and **RSD1** are both required for inhibiting ectopic asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) and clustered stomata.
   - By dehydration stress assay, the decreased stomatal density of **RSD1** mutants enhanced their dehydration avoidance.
   - **RSD1** Is Essential for Stomatal Patterning and Files in Rice.
   - It was found that the deletion of **RSD1** would lead to the disorder of gene expression regarding stomatal development, especially the expression of stomatal density and distribution 1 (OsSDD1).
   - Through the construction of OsSDD1 deletion mutants by CRISPR-Cas9, we found that, similar to **RSD1** mutants, the ossdd1 mutants have clustered stomata and extra small cells adjacent to the stomata.
