## Functional Descriptions:
   - The rice **FLO2** mutation resulted in reduced grain size and starch quality.
   - These results suggest that **FLO2** plays a pivotal regulatory role in rice grain size and starch quality by affecting storage substance accumulation in the endosperm.
   - **FLO2** was abundantly expressed in developing seeds coincident with production of storage starch and protein, as well as in leaves, while abundant expression of its homologs was observed only in leaves.
   - The **FLO2** mutation decreased expression of genes involved in production of storage starch and storage proteins in the endosperm.
   - Differences between cultivars in their responsiveness of **FLO2** expression during high-temperature stress indicated that **FLO2** may be involved in heat tolerance during seed development.
   - Map-based cloning identified FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (**FLO2**), a member of a novel gene family conserved in plants, as the gene responsible for the rice **FLO2** mutation.
   - Overexpression of **FLO2** enlarged the size of grains significantly.
   - The effect of the **FLO2** mutations on the physicochemical properties of the grain included a low breakdown, setback, and consistency of rice, indicating a good elasticity and soft texture of cooked rice grains.
   - The allelic diversity of **FLO2** perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL.
   - Physiochemical analyses of the **FLO2** mutants were congruent with previous studies, exhibiting lowered AC and viscosity, risen gel consistency (GC) and gelatinization temperature (GT) values, which were all instrumental to the improvement of ECQ.
   - The diversity of **FLO2** allele is attributable for the variations in grain appearance, amylose content (AC), and physicochemical properties, influencing the eating and cooking quality (ECQ) of rice.
