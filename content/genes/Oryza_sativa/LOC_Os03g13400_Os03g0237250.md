## Functional Descriptions:
   - **LPA1** regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint.
   - **LPA1** is localized in the nucleus and functions as an active transcriptional repressor, an activity mainly conferred by a conserved ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression-like motif.
   - Expression pattern analysis suggested that **LPA1** influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint.
   - Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Loose Plant Architecture1 (**LPA1**) gene in rice, the functional ortholog of the AtIDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM5 (SGR5) gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
   - **LPA1** was also found to affect shoot gravitropism.
   - Genetic and biochemical data indicate that **LPA1** suppresses the auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo BRs, which regulates lamina inclination independently of OsBRI1.
   - RNA sequencing analysis and qRT-PCR indicate that **LPA1** influences the expression of three OsPIN genes (OsPIN1a, OsPIN1c and OsPIN3a), which suggests that auxin flux might be an important factor in **LPA1**-mediated lamina inclination in rice.
   - Mutant **LPA1** plants are hypersensitive to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) during the lamina inclination response, which is suppressed by the brassinazole (Brz) inhibitor of C-22 hydroxylase involved in BR synthesis.
   - This study explores the role of **LPA1** in determining lamina inclination in rice.
   - **LPA1** acts as a positive regulator to suppress lamina bending.
   - A strong synergic effect is detected between **LPA1** and d2 (the defective mutant for catalysis of C-23-hydroxylated BRs) during IAA-mediated lamina inclination.
   - Novel allelic variant of **LPA1** gene associated with a significant reduction in seed phytic acid content in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - **LPA1** expressed in pre-vascular cells of leaf primordia regulates genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and cell enlargement.
   - Narrow **LPA1** Metaxylems Enhance Drought Tolerance and Optimize Water Use for Grain Filling in Dwarf Rice..
   - Narrow metaxylem of **LPA1** exhibit leaves curling on sunny day and convey drought tolerance but reduce grain yield in mature plants.
   - However, the genetic combination of **LPA1** with semi-dwarf mutant (dep1-ko or d2) offer optimal water supply and drought resistance without impacting grain-filling rates.
   - We performed genetic combination of **LPA1** with semi-dwarf mutant to offer the optimum rice architecture for more efficient water use.
