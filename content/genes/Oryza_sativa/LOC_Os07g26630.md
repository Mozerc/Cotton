## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two rice plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, **OsPIP2;4** and OsPIP2;7, are involved in transport and providing tolerance to boron toxicity.
   - Transcript analysis demonstrated that the expression of **OsPIP2;4** and OsPIP2;7 were downregulated in shoots and strongly upregulated in rice roots by high B treatment.
   - Arabidopsis lines overexpressing **OsPIP2;4** and OsPIP2;7 showed significantly higher biomass production and greater root length, however there was no difference in B accumulation in long term uptake assay.
   - Short-term uptake assay using tracer B ((1)(0)B) in shoots and roots demonstrated increased (1)(0)B accumulation in Arabidopsis lines expressing **OsPIP2;4** and OsPIP2;7, compare to wild type control plants.
   - Efflux assay of B in the roots showed that (1)(0)B was effluxed from the Arabidopsis transgenic plants overexpressing **OsPIP2;4** or OsPIP2;7 during the initial 1-h of assay.
   - These data indicate that **OsPIP2;4** and OsPIP2;7 are involved in mediating B transport in rice and provide tolerance via efflux of excess B from roots and shoot tissues.
   - Overexpression of **OsPIP2;4**, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Arabidopsis yielded enhanced arsenite tolerance and higher biomass accumulation.
   - qRT-PCR analysis of PIPs in rice root and shoot tissues revealed a significant down regulation of transcripts encoding OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3, **OsPIP2;4**, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in response to arsenite treatment.
   - Heterologous expression of **OsPIP2;4**, OsPIP2;6, and OsPIP2;7 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increased the uptake of arsenite.
   - Expression levels of two root-specific aquaporin genes, **OsPIP2;4** and OsPIP2;5, were increased significantly after 6 and 13 d of LRT exposure.
