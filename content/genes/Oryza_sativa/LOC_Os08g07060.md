## Functional Descriptions:
   - The role of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH)-dependent cyclic electron flow around photosystem I in photosynthetic regulation and plant growth at several temperatures was examined in rice (Oryza sativa) that is defective in CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION 6 (**CRR6**), which is required for accumulation of sub-complex A of the chloroplast NDH complex (**CRR6**).
   - However, when plants were grown at 20 degrees C, all the examined photosynthetic parameters were significantly lower in **CRR6** mutants than control plants, and this effect on photosynthesis caused a corresponding reduction in plant biomass.
   - However, after long-term acclimation to the low temperature, impairment of cyclic electron flow suppressed non-photochemical quenching and promoted reduction of the plastoquinone pool in **CRR6** mutants.
