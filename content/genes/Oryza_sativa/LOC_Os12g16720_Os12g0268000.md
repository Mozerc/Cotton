## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g16720](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g16720)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0268000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0268000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsSL,LLM1,ELL1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **ELL1** mutant exhibited decreased chlorophyll contents, serious chloroplast degradation, up-regulated expression of chloroplast degradation-related genes, and attenuated photosynthetic protein activity, indicating that **ELL1** is involved in chloroplast development.
   - Our findings revealed that **ELL1** affects chloroplast development or function, and that loss of **ELL1** function induces ROS accumulation and lesion formation in rice.
   - Additionally, lesion initiation in the **ELL1** mutant was light dependent and temperature sensitive.
   - RNA-seq analysis showed that genes related to oxygen binding were differentially expressed in **ELL1** and wild-type plants; histochemical and paraffin sectioning results displayed that hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and callose accumulated in the **ELL1** leaves, and the cell structure around the lesion was severely damaged, which indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated and cell death occurred in the mutant.
   - TUNEL and comet experiments revealed that severe DNA degradation and abnormal PCD occurred in the mutant, which implied that excessive ROS accumulation may induce DNA damage and ROS-mediated cell death in the **ELL1** mutant.
