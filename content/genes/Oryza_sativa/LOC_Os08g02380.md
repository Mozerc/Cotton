## Functional Descriptions:
   - Together, our results suggest that **PSS1** defines a novel member of the kinesin-1 family essential for male meiotic chromosomal dynamics, male gametogenesis, and anther dehiscence in rice.
   - In this report, we found the female gamete of W207-2 was normal, and its semi-sterility was unaffected by growth duration but was conditioned by a recessive nuclear gene whose action leads to pollen semi-sterility and anther indehiscence, and the gene was named as **PSS1** (pollen semi-sterile).
   - Fine mapping of **PSS1**, a pollen semi-sterile gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - Here, we describe a rice pollen semi-sterility1 (**PSS1**) mutant, which displays reduced spikelet fertility (~40%) primarily caused by reduced pollen viability (~50% viable), and defective anther dehiscence.
   - Furthermore, **PSS1** expression is significantly upregulated during anther development and peaks during male meiosis.
   - Consistent with this, lagging chromosomes and chromosomal bridges were found at anaphase I and anaphase II of male meiosis in the **PSS1** mutant.
   - **PSS1** is broadly expressed in various organs, with highest expression in panicles.
