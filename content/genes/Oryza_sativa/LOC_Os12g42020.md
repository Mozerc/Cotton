## Functional Descriptions:
   - Constitutive overexpression of **OsPID** caused a variety of abnormalities, such as delay of adventitious root development, curled growth of shoots and agravitropism.
   - Analysis of **OsPID** mRNA distribution showed a complex pattern in shoot meristems, indicating that it probably plays a role in the pattern formation and organogenesis in the rice shoot.
   - Abnormalities observed in the plants that overexpress **OsPID** could be phenocopied by treatment with an inhibitor of active polar transport of auxin, indicating that **OsPID** could be involved in the control of polar auxin transport in rice.
   - Characterization of **OsPID**, the rice ortholog of PINOID, and its possible involvement in the control of polar auxin transport.
   - Interestingly, **OsPID** mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they develop any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in pid mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and maize (Zea mays).
   - Disruption of the rice PINOID (**OsPID**) gene completely eliminated the development of stigmas, and overexpression of **OsPID** led to over-proliferation of stigmas, suggesting that **OsPID** is a key determinant for stigma development.
   - The **OsPID** osnyp2 double mutants developed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to pid mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of **OsPID** in inflorescence development are likely masked by redundant partners.
   - Unlike the pid mutant that shows typical pin-like inflorescences in maize (Zea mays) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the **OsPID** mutant does not display any defects in inflorescence development and flower initiation.
   - Furthermore, the expression of most auxin response factor (ARF) genes was down-regulated, and OsETTIN1, OsETTIN2 and OsMONOPTEROS lost their rearrangements of expression patterns during pistil and stamen primordia development in **OsPID**.
   - The auxin activity in the young pistil of **OsPID** was lower than that in the wild-type pistil.
   - Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, OSH1, was down-regulated and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 (CLV3), was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of **OsPID**.
   - These results suggested that the meristem proliferation in the pistil primordium might be arrested prematurely in **OsPID**.
   - Our data demonstrate that **OsPID** interacts with OsPIN1a and OsPIN1b to regulate polar auxin transport as shown previously.
   - Together, we propose a model that **OsPID** regulates floral organ development by modulating auxin polar transport and interaction with OsMADS16 and/or LAX1 in rice.
   - Additionally, **OsPID** also interacts with OsMADS16 to regulate transcription during floral organ development in rice.
   - These results provide a novel insight into the role of **OsPID** in regulating floral organ development of rice, especially in stigma development, which would be useful for genetic improvement of high-yield breeding of rice.
