- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0632000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0632000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** Osgr-rbp4;Osgrp1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Osgr-rbp4** transcript in rice seedlings is constitutively expressed as well as regulated by different abiotic stresses including high temperature stress.
   - Ectopic over-expression of **Osgr-rbp4** cDNA imparts high temperature stress tolerance to wild type yeast cells.
   - Thus, the expression of the **Osgrp1** gene is closely associated with cell elongation/expansion during the post-mitotic cell differentiation process.
   - Expression of the rice **Osgrp1** promoter-Gus reporter gene is specifically associated with cell elongation/expansion and differentiation.
   - The **Osgrp1**-Gus gene was also expressed in response to wounding and down-regulated by water-stress conditions in the elongation region of roots.
   - It is shown that **Osgr-rbp4** in rice leaf cells and its immunologically homologous protein in tobacco BY2 protoplasts are nuclear proteins.
   - To study the expression and regulation of a rice glycine-rich cell wall protein gene, **Osgrp1**, transgenic rice plants were regenerated that contain the **Osgrp1** promoter or its 5' deletions fused with the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene.
