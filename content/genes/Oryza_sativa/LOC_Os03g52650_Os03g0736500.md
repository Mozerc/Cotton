- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0736500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0736500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsKNOLLE
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The transformants with **OsKNOLLE** showed better survival abilities than the transformants with the empty vectors based on their phenotypes in responses to different abiotic stresses such as salt, Cu2+, H2O2, Cd2+, and Hg2+.
   - These data suggests that **OsKNOLLE** plays a crucial role in re-sponses to abiotic stresses.
   - This experimental system sets up a method for studying functions of the **OsKNOLLE** gene in the future and clarifies the relationship between **OsKNOLLE** and abiotic stresses.
   - Heterologous expression of a rice syntaxin-related protein KNOLLE gene (<I>**OsKNOLLE**</I>) in yeast and its functional analysis in the role of abiotic stress.
