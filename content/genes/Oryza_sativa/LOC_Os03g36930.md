- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0566800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0566800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsRH34</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that OsRH2 and **OsRH34** had 99 % identity and 100 % similarity, and their gene expression patterns were similar in various rice tissues, but the level of OsRH2 mRNA was about 58-fold higher than that of **OsRH34** mRNA in seedlings.
   - The phenotypes of three independent OsRH2 and **OsRH34** double-knockdown transgenic lines included dwarfism, a short internode distance, reproductive delay, defective embryonic development, and a low seed setting rate.
   - Both OsRH2 and **OsRH34** are core components of the EJC, and participate in regulating of plant height, pollen, and seed development in rice.
   - In addition, the OsRH2 and **OsRH34** double-knockdown transgenic lines exhibited the accumulation of unspliced rice UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM 1 mRNA.
