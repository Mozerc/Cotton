## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Rice Small Auxin-Up RNA Gene **OsSAUR33** Regulates Seed Vigor via Sugar Pathway during Early Seed Germination.
   - Here, we observed that disruption of **OsSAUR33** resulted in reduced germination rates and low seed uniformity in early germination.
   - RNA-seq analysis revealed that **OsSAUR33** modulated seed vigor by affecting the mobilization of stored reserves during germination.
   - Disruption of **OsSAUR33** increased sugar-sensitive phenotypes in early germination, suggesting **OsSAUR33** likely affects seed vigor through the sugar pathway.
   - One elite haplotype of **OsSAUR33** associated with higher seed vigor was identified mainly in indica accessions.
   - This study provides insight into the effects of **OsSAUR33** on seed vigor in rice.
   - **OsSAUR33** interacted with the sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase OsSnRK1A, a regulator of the sugar signaling pathway, which influences the expression of sugar signaling-related genes during germination.
   - Disruption of **OsSAUR33** increased the soluble sugar content in dry mature grains and seeds during early germination.
