## Functional Descriptions:
   - **LSSR1** is predominantly expressed in anthers during the microsporogenesis stage, and its encoded protein contains a signal peptide at the N-terminal, which may be a secretory protein that stores in pollen grains and functions during rice fertilization.
   - In addition, **LSSR1** pollen grains could be normally stained by I2-KI solution.
   - Cytological results demonstrate that the blockage of fertilization mostly accounted for the low seed setting rate in **LSSR1** mutant lines, which was most likely caused by abnormal pollen grain germination, failed pollen tube penetration, and retarded pollen tube elongation.
   - **LSSR1** facilitates seed setting rate by promoting fertilization in rice.
   - To explore the physiological function of **LSSR1** in rice, loss-of-function mutants of **LSSR1** were created through the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which showed a significant decrease in rice seed setting rate.
   - Together, our results suggest that **LSSR1** plays an important role in rice fertilization, which in turn is vital for maintaining rice seed setting rate.
   - However, the morphology of the vegetative and reproductive organs appears normal in **LSSR1** mutant lines.
