- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0580400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0580400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsDUR3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - * Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed upregulation of **OsDUR3** in rice roots under nitrogen-deficiency and urea-resupply after nitrogen-starvation.
   - * A high-affinity urea transporter **OsDUR3** from rice was functionally characterized here for the first time among crops.
   - Together with its plasma membrane localization detected by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagging and with findings that disruption of **OsDUR3** by T-DNA reduces rice growth on urea and urea uptake, we suggest that **OsDUR3** is an active urea transporter that plays a significant role in effective urea acquisition and utilisation in rice.
   - Heterologous expression demonstrated that **OsDUR3** restored yeast dur3-mutant growth on urea and facilitated urea import with a K(m) of c.
   - Importantly, overexpression of **OsDUR3** complemented the Arabidopsis atdur3-1 mutant, improving growth on low urea and increasing root urea-uptake markedly.
