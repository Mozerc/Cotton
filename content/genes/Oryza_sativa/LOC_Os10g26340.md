## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PLA1** of rice is not only a plastochron mutant showing rapid leaf initiation without affecting phyllotaxy, but also a heterochronic mutant showing ectopic shoot formation in the reproductive phase.
   - On the basis of these findings, we propose that NL1 is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of **PLA1** and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice.
   - The shoot apical meristem of **PLA1** was larger than that of the wild type, although the shape was not modified.
   - An in situ hybridization experiment using the histone H4 gene as a probe revealed that cell divisions are accelerated in the **PLA1** meristem.
   - The **PLA1** gene is considered to regulate the duration of the vegetative phase by controlling the rate of leaf production in the meristem.
   - **PLA1** is expressed in developing leaf primordia, bracts of the panicle, and elongating internodes, but not in the shoot apical meristem.
   - These results indicate that both **PLA1** and PLA2 act downstream of the GA signal transduction pathway to regulate leaf development.
   - Because the onset of the reproductive phase in **PLA1** was not temporally affected, the number of leaves produced in the vegetative phase was nearly twice that produced in the wild type.
   - These results indicate that both vegetative and reproductive programs are expressed simultaneously during the reproductive phase of **PLA1**; however, the degree varied depending on the strength of the allele.
   - Thus, **PLA1** provides a tool for analyzing the molecular basis of temporal regulation in leaf development.
   - pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to **PLA1** and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase.
   - Panicle development was severely disturbed in **PLA1** mutants.
   - In the weak allele **PLA1**-2, however, only the basal one or two primordia developed as vegetative shoots, and the remaining primordia developed to produce a truncated panicle.
   - However, in contrast to **PLA1** and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology.
   - Rice PLASTOCHRON 1 (**PLA1**) and PLA2 genes regulate leaf maturation and plastochron, and their loss-of-function mutants exhibit small organs and rapid leaf emergence.
   - GA induced **PLA1** and PLA2 expression, and conversely the GA-inhibitor uniconazole suppressed **PLA1** and PLA2 expression.
   - In **PLA1**-4 and pla2-1 seedlings, expression levels of GA biosynthesis genes and the signal transduction gene were similar to those in wild-type seedlings.
   - GA treatment slightly down-regulated the GA biosynthesis gene GA20ox2 and up-regulated the GA-catabolizing gene GA2ox4, whereas the GA biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole up-regulated GA20ox2 and down-regulated GA2ox4 both in wild-type and pla mutants, suggesting that the GA feedback mechanism is not impaired in **PLA1** and pla2.
   - To reveal how GA signal transduction affects the expression of **PLA1** and PLA2, PLA expression in GA-signaling mutants was examined.
   - In **PLA1**-1, many primordia of primary rachis branches were converted into vegetative shoots.
   - Accordingly, **PLA1** is a heterochronic mutation that extends the vegetative period.
   - The expression pattern and mutant phenotype suggest that the **PLA1** gene acting in developing leaf primordia affects the timing of successive leaf initiation and the termination of vegetative growth.
   - A novel mutant allele of PLASTOCHRON1 (**PLA1**), a gene known to play a key role in regulating leaf initiation, was identified in this study.
   - We found that gibberellin (GA) is the major phytohormone that promotes **PLA1** and PLA2 expression.
   - Here, we investigated how **PLA1** and PLA2 genes are related to phytohormones.
   - We show that PLA2 normally acts to retard the rate of leaf maturation but does so independently of **PLA1**, which encodes a member of the P450 family.
