## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **OsbZIP23** is strongly induced by a wide spectrum of stresses, including drought, salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol treatments, while other stress-responsive genes of this family are slightly induced only by one or two of the stresses.
   - Transgenic rice overexpressing **OsbZIP23** showed significantly improved tolerance to drought and high-salinity stresses and sensitivity to ABA.
   - On the other hand, a null mutant of this gene showed significantly decreased sensitivity to a high concentration of ABA and decreased tolerance to high-salinity and drought stress, and this phenotype can be complemented by transforming the **OsbZIP23** back into the mutant.
   - We propose that **OsbZIP23** is a major player of the bZIP family in rice for conferring ABA-dependent drought and salinity tolerance and has high potential usefulness in genetic improvement of stress tolerance.
   - Characterization of **OsbZIP23** as a key player of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family for conferring abscisic acid sensitivity and salinity and drought tolerance in rice.
   - The stress-related genes activated by OsbZIP46CA1 are largely different from those activated by the other rice ABF/AREB homologs (such as **OsbZIP23**), further implying the value of OsbZIP46CA1 in genetic engineering of drought tolerance.
   - **OsbZIP23** is a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, **OsbZIP23**, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C.
   - It has high sequence similarity to ABA-responsive element binding factor (ABF/AREB) transcription factors ABI5 and **OsbZIP23**, two transcriptional activators positively regulating stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice, respectively.
   - Collectively, these results indicate that **OsbZIP23** functions as a transcriptional regulator that can regulate the expression of a wide spectrum of stress-related genes in response to abiotic stresses through an ABA-dependent regulation pathway.
   - The single-copy **OsbZIP23** gene is expressed at relatively higher level in leaf tissues of drought-tolerant genotypes, and its abundance is more in reproductive stage.
   - Enhanced Gene Expression Rather than Natural Polymorphism in Coding Sequence of the **OsbZIP23** Determines Drought Tolerance and Yield Improvement in Rice Genotypes..
   - The overexpression of any of the two polymorphic forms (1083 bp and 1068 bp CDS) of **OsbZIP23** improved drought tolerance and yield-related traits significantly by retaining higher content of cellular water, soluble sugar and proline; and exhibited decrease in membrane lipid peroxidation in comparison to RNAi lines and non-transgenic plants.
   - Taken together, the present study concludes that the enhanced gene expression rather than natural polymorphism in coding sequence of **OsbZIP23** is accountable for improved drought tolerance and yield performance in rice genotypes.
   - The OE lines showed higher expression of target genes-OsRab16B, OsRab21 and OsLEA3-1 and increased ABA sensitivity; indicating that **OsbZIP23** is a positive transcriptional-regulator of the ABA-signaling pathway.
   - The **OsbZIP23** transcription factor has been characterized for its essential role in drought resistance in rice, but the mechanism is unknown.
   - Together, our results suggest that **OsbZIP23** acts as a central regulator in ABA signaling and biosynthesis, and drought resistance in rice.
   - Next, we performed genome-wide identification of **OsbZIP23** targets by immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses in the **OsbZIP23**-overexpression, **OsbZIP23** mutant, and wild-type rice under normal and drought stress conditions.
   - Among these targets, we found that **OsbZIP23** could positively regulate OsPP2C49, and overexpression of OsPP2C49 in rice resulted in significantly decreased sensitivity of the ABA response and rapid dehydration.
   - Moreover, OsNCED4 (9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 4), a key gene in ABA biosynthesis, was also positively regulated by **OsbZIP23**.
   - **OsbZIP23** directly regulates a large number of reported genes that function in stress response, hormone signaling, and developmental processes.
   - A homolog of SnRK2 protein kinase SAPK2 was found to interact with and phosphorylate **OsbZIP23** for its transcriptional activation.
   - Synergistic regulation of drought-responsive genes by transcription factor **OsbZIP23** and histone modification in rice..
   - Here, we report an interplay between histone H3K4me3 modification and transcription factor **OsbZIP23** in the regulation of a dehydrin gene cluster under drought stress conditions in rice.
   - Conversely, the H3K4me3 modification and dehydrin gene expression levels were down-regulated in the **OsbZIP23** mutant under drought stress conditions.
   - The transcription factor **OsbZIP23** was demonstrated to regulate the UGT2 expression under stress conditions.
