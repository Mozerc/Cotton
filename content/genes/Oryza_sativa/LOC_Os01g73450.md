## Functional Descriptions:
   - Map-based cloning results showed that Loc_Os01g73450, encoding a chloroplast-targeted UMP kinase, corresponded to **YGL8** and played an important role in regulating leaf colour in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Analysis of the spatial and temporal expression of **YGL8** indicated that it was highly expressed in leaf blades and weakly expressed in other tissues.
   - The levels of Chl a, Chl b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in **YGL8** than those in the WT throughout the whole growth period, while no clear change was noted in the Chl a/b ratio.
   - Independent of Chl biosynthesis and photosystem, **YGL8** may affect the structure and function of chloroplasts grana lamellae by regulating plastid genome encoded thylakoid membrane constitutive gene expression and indirectly influences Chl biosynthesis.
   - Chloroplast development was abnormal in the **YL2** mutant, possibly due to reduced accumulation of thylakoid membranes and a lack of normal stroma lamellae.
   - Genetic analyses revealed that **YL2** encodes a thylakoid membrane-localized protein with significant sequence similarity to UMP kinase proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
   - Prokaryotic UMP kinase activity was subsequently confirmed, with **YL2** deficiency causing a significant reduction in chlorophyll accumulation and photochemical efficiency.
