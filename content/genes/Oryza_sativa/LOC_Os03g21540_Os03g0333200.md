- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A phenotypic comparison of mutants expressing different amounts of **DRUS1** and 2 revealed that reproductive growth requires a threshold level of **DRUS1**/2 proteins.
   - **DRUS1** and 2 maintain cell viability by repressing protease-mediated cell degradation and likely by affecting sugar utilization or conversion.
   - We observed that both **FLR1** and FLR2 were involved in tillering of rice, but at different levels.
   - Interestingly, **FLR1** and FLR2 showed different functions related to fertility, and **FLR1** might be specifically involved in rice male gametophyte development.
   - In this study, we generated **FLR1** and flr2 T-DNA insertion null mutants and investigated potential role of FLRs in rice yield.
   - With these similar but different functions, we suggest that **FLR1** and FLR2 might function in complementary ways to regulate the yield of rice.
   - To elucidate the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we found that **FLR1** was constitutively expressed during endosperm development.
   - **FLR1** mutants had a higher cell number and an accelerated rate of grain filling compared to wild-type plants, which led to grains with greater widths.
   - A mechanism underlying the regulation of grain size by **FLR1** is that **FLR1** is associated with OsRac1 Rho-like GTPase, a positive regulator of grain size.
   - Regarding grain quality, the **FLR1** mutant had a higher percentage of chalkiness compared with wild-type plants, and seeds carrying mutations in flr3 and **FLR1**4 had endosperms with white floury cores.
   - RNA-seq analysis identified 2,367 genes that were differentially expressed in the **FLR1** mutant, including genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism and carbon fixation.
   - In the present study, we found that FERONIA-like receptor 1 (**FLR1**) positively regulates Magnaporthe oryzae resistance and that expression of **FLR1** is strongly induced in response to Ca(2+) deficiency.
   - Moreover, RNA sequencing revealed 2,697 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the **FLR1** mutant compared with wild-type, and some of these DEGs are involved in cellular metal ion homeostasis and transition metal ion homeostasis.
   - Changes in expression of overlapping genes between the **FLR1** mutant and in plants under low-Ca(2+) treatment were consistent in terms of direction, indicating that **FLR1** is involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis.
