## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we found that the genes DROOPING LEAF (**DL**) and OsETTIN2 (OsETT2) are involved in awn development in the awned indica strain Kasalath.
   - Severe loss-of-function mutations of **DL** cause complete homeotic transformation of carpels into stamens.
   - In this article, we report that carpel specification in the Oryza sativa (rice) flower is regulated by the floral homeotic gene DROOPING LEAF (**DL**) that is distinct from the well-known ABC genes.
   - In addition, severe and weak **DL** alleles fail to form a midrib in the leaf.
   - The phenotypic analysis of **DL** mutants, together with analyses of the spatial expression patterns and ectopic expression of **DL**, demonstrate that **DL** regulates midrib formation by promoting cell proliferation in the central region of the rice leaf.
   - These results suggest that carpel specification is regulated by **DL** in rice flower development.
   - Here, we report the interactions of rice (Oryza sativa) floral homeotic genes, OsMADS3 (a C-class gene), OsMADS13 (a D-class gene), and DROOPING LEAF (**DL**), in specifying floral organ identities and floral meristem determinacy.
   - Strikingly, osmads3-4 **DL**-sup6 displayed a severe loss of floral meristem determinacy and produced supernumerary whorls of lodicule-like organs at the forth whorl, suggesting that OsMADS3 and **DL** synergistically terminate the floral meristem.
   - These observations suggest that **DL** and OsMADS13 may function in the same pathway specifying the identity of carpel/ovule and floral meristem.
   - Consistent with these functions, **DL** is initially expressed in the central region of the leaf primordia (presumptive midrib) and in the presumptive carpel primordia in the meristem.
   - We also show that **DL** interacts antagonistically with class B genes and controls floral meristem determinacy.
   - The awn is a long nee**DL**e-like appendage that, in some grass species, is formed on the lemma that encloses floral organs together with the palea.
   - OsETT2 is expressed in the awn primordium in the awned indica floret, but not in the awnless japonica floret except in the provascular bun**DL**e.
   - The DROOPING LEAF (**DL**) gene, a member of the YABBY gene family, promotes midrib formation in the leaf and carpel specification in the flower.
   - 4kb, and introns 1 and 2, was shown to be sufficient to induce **DL** in the presumptive midrib, and to suppress it in other regions in the leaf primordia.
   - We modified Oryza sativa (rice) plant architecture by expressing an activated version of **DL** (**DL**-VP16) in a precise manner using the DG1 sequence: the resulting transgenic plant produced a midrib in the distal region of the leaf blade, where there is no midrib in wild type, and formed more upright leaves compared with the wild type.
   - The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (**DL**) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers.
   - In the weakest mutant, **DL**-2, most of the flowers are normal.
   - The flower of the double mutant, spw1 **DL**-sup, produces incompletely differentiated organs indefinitely after palea-like organs are produced in the position where lodicules are formed in the wild-type flower.
   - Genetic analyses and RNA-silencing experiments indicate that **DL** and OsETT2 act independently in awn formation, and that either gene alone is not sufficient for awn development.
   - The YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF (**DL**) regulates midrib formation in the leaves and carpel specification in the flowers of rice (Oryza sativa L).
   - By comparing the expression levels of **DL** and leaf phenotypes in the **DL** mutants with different severities, we confirmed our previous hypothesis that **DL** promotes cell proliferation in the central region of leaf primordia, and that this cell proliferation is critical for midrib formation in the mature leaves.
   - Collectively, we propose a model to illustrate the role of OsMADS3, **DL**, and OsMADS13 in the specification of flower organ identity and meristem determinacy in rice.
   - We analyzed recessive mutants of two homeotic genes in rice, SUPERWOMAN1 (SPW1) and DROOPING LEAF (**DL**).
   - In contrast, two strong alleles of the **DL** locus, drooping leaf-superman1 (**DL**-sup1) and drooping leaf-superman2 (**DL**-sup2), cause the complete transformation of the gynoecium into stamens.
   - Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of **DL** function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers.
   - We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of **DL** expression.
   - Furthermore, the defects of osmads13-3 **DL**-sup6 flowers appeared identical to those of **DL**-sup6, and the OsMADS13 expression was undetectable in **DL**-sup6 flowers.
   - The intermediate allele **DL**-1 (T65), results in an increase in the number of stamens and stigmas, and carpels occasionally show staminoid characteristics.
   - Based on genetic and molecular results, we postulate a model of stamen and carpel specification in rice, with **DL** as a novel gene controlling carpel identity and acting mutually and antagonistically to the class B gene, SPW1.
   - We generated drooping leaf rice mutants by CRISPR/Cas and identified two novel alleles with specific editing that allow underpinning of the function of the **DL** protein domain towards midrib and carpel formations.
   - The DROOPING LEAF (**DL**) gene plays an essential role in regulating midrib formation and carpel specification in rice and other grass species, but the specific function of **DL** protein domains in different developmental processes is unclear.
   - These **DL** mutant alleles contribute to the **DL** gene functional analysis and to gain insights into possible modifications of leaf architecture of rice and other grass species.
   - Here, we generated Nipponbare rice **DL** mutants using CRISPR/Cas gene editing and identified two novel **DL** alleles with different effects on midrib formation and carpel development.
