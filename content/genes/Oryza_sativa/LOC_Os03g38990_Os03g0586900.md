## Functional Descriptions:
   - Disruption of a Upf1-like helicase-encoding gene **OsPLS2** triggers light-dependent premature leaf senescence in rice..
   - Disruption of **OsPLS2** accelerated light-dependent leaf senescence in the rice mutant of **OsPLS2**.
   - This mutation prompts aberrant splicing of **OsPLS2** messenger and consequent disruption of its full-length protein translation, suggesting a negative role of **OsPLS2** in regulating leaf senescence.
   - When continuously exposed to far-red light, exogenous H2O2 and/or abscisic acid (ABA), the **OsPLS2** mutant sustained hypersensitive leaf senescence.
   - In consistence, light and ROS signal pathways in **OsPLS2** were activated by down-regulation of phytochrome genes, and up-regulation of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) and WRKY genes, all promoting leaf senescence.
   - Together, these data indicated that **OsPLS2** played an essential role in leaf senescence and its disruption triggered light-dependent leaf senescence in rice.
   - Shading and light filtration studies showed that the **OsPLS2** phenotype, which was characteristic of photo-oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, was an effect of irritation by light.
   - The **OsPLS2** locus was isolated and cloned by map-based cloning that encodes a Upf1-like helicase.
   - Through map-based cloning, a G-to-A substitution was determined at the 1st nucleotide of the 13th intron in the **OsPLS2** gene that encodes a Upf1-like helicase.
