## Functional Descriptions:
   - Oligoarray analysis revealed **OsPIL1** downstream genes, which were enriched for cell wall-related genes responsible for cell elongation.
   - These data suggest that **OsPIL1** functions as a key regulatory factor of reduced plant height via cell wall-related genes in response to drought stress.
   - We found that **OsPIL1** was highly expressed in the node portions of the stem using promoter-glucuronidase analysis.
   - In addition, **OsPIL13** and OsPIL15 colocalize with OsPRR1, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis APRR1 gene that controls photoperiodic flowering response through clock function.
   - Together, these results suggest that overexpression of OsLF might repress expression of OsGI and Hd1 by competing with OsPRR1 in interacting with **OsPIL13** and OsPIL15 and thus induce late flowering.
   - An atypical HLH protein OsLF in rice regulates flowering time and interacts with **OsPIL13** and OsPIL15.
   - Here, we demonstrate that a phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein, OsPIL1/**OsPIL13**, acts as a key regulator of reduced internode elongation in rice under drought conditions.
   - Under drought stress conditions, **OsPIL1** expression was inhibited during the light period.
   - Rice phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein **OsPIL1** functions as a key regulator of internode elongation and induces a morphological response to drought stress.
   - It was found that the expression of **OsPIL13** is under the control of circadian rhythms (clock), while the expression of OsPIL15 is negatively regulated by light upon the onset to light exposure of etiolated seedlings.
   - The level of **OsPIL1** mRNA in rice seedlings grown under nonstressed conditions with light/dark cycles oscillated in a circadian manner with peaks in the middle of the light period.
   - Transcriptome analyses showed increased expression of abiotic stress-inducible DREB1A downstream genes and cell elongation-related **OsPIL1** downstream genes in the double overexpressors, which suggests that these two transcription factors function independently in the transgenic plants despite the trade-offs required to balance plant growth and stress tolerance.
   - The transgenic plants overexpressing both **OsPIL1** and DREB1A showed improved drought stress tolerance similar to that of DREB1A overexpressors.
   - **OsPIL1** is a rice homologue of Arabidopsis PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), and it enhances cell elongation by activating cell wall-related gene expression.
   - Here, we show that **OsPIL1** negatively regulates leaf senescence in rice.
   - Microarray analysis revealed that during DIS, a number of senescence-associated genes were upregulated and OsGLKs, negative regulators of leaf senescence, were strongly repressed in **OsPIL1** mutants.
   - In addition, **OsPIL1** expressed in Arabidopsis upregulates the transcription of ORESARA1, a major senescence-inducing NAC transcription factor and one of the downstream genes of Arabidopsis PIF4, by directly binding the promoter region.
   - During dark-induced senescence (DIS), **OsPIL1** mutants senesced earlier than wild type; this is opposite to mutants of Arabidopsis PIF4 and PIF5, the closest homologs of **OsPIL1**.
   - In addition, **OsPIL1** directly up-regulates the expression of two transcription factor genes, GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and OsGLK2.
   - Transcriptome analysis revealed that several genes responsible for Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis were significantly down-regulated in **OsPIL1** leaves.
   - Thus, **OsPIL1** is involved in the promotion of Chl biosynthesis by up-regulating the transcription of OsPORB and OsCAO1 via trifurcate feed-forward regulatory loops involving two OsGLKs.
   - The **OsPIL1** (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 1) gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor.
   - Overexpression of **OsPIL1** enhanced biomass yield and saccharification efficiency in switchgrass..
   - Here, we introduced the **OsPIL1** gene into switchgrass by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with the aim of improving biomass yield of transgenic switchgrass plants.
   - The transgenic plants overexpression of **OsPIL1** showed increased plant height and biomass yield.
   - The results suggest **OsPIL1** can be used as a useful molecular tool in improving plant biomass and saccharification efficiency with the purpose of plant fiber biofuel ethanol production.
   - **OsPIL1** overexpressed transgenic switchgrass plants also released more soluble sugar after enzymatic hydrolysis, indicating improved saccharification efficiency.
