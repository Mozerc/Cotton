- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os09g0280600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os09g0280600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsMFS1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Taken together, our results indicated that **OsMFS1** is indispensable to the normal development of anther and embryo sacs in rice.
   - Here, we characterized a completely sterile **OsMFS1** (male and female sterility 1) mutant which has its pollen and embryo sacs both aborted at the reproductive stage due to severe chromosome defection.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the **OsMFS1** encodes a meiotic coiled-coil protein, and it is responsible for DSB repairing that acts as an important cofactor to stimulate the single strand invasion.
   - Subcellular localization analysis of **OsMFS1** revealed its association with the nucleus exclusively.
   - Expression pattern analyses showed the **OsMFS1** was preferentially expressed in meiosis stage.
   - In addition, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and pull-down assay showed that **OsMFS1** could physically interact with OsHOP2 protein to form a stable complex to ensure faithful homologous recombination.
