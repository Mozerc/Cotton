- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0743100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0743100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsBIRF1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Reduced ABA sensitivity in root elongation and increased drought tolerance in seed germination were also observed in **OsBIRF1** transgenic tobacco plants.
   - Expression of **OsBIRF1** was up-regulated in rice seedlings after treatment with benzothaidiazole, salicylic acid, l-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and jasmonic acid, and was induced differentially in incompatible but not compatible interactions between rice and Magnaporthe grisea, the causal agent of blast disease.
   - Transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express **OsBIRF1** exhibit enhanced disease resistance against tobacco mosaic virus and Pseudomonas syringae pv.
   - These results demonstrate that **OsBIRF1** has pleiotropic effects on growth and defense response against multiple abiotic and biotic stresses.
   - Functional analysis reveals pleiotropic effects of rice RING-H2 finger protein gene **OsBIRF1** on regulation of growth and defense responses against abiotic and biotic stresses.
   - The **OsBIRF1**-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants show increased oxidative stress tolerance to exogenous treatment with methyl viologen and H2O2, and up-regulate expression of oxidative stress-related genes.
   - Furthermore, the transgenic tobacco plants show longer roots and higher plant heights as compared with the wild-type plants, suggesting that overexpression of **OsBIRF1** promote plant growth.
