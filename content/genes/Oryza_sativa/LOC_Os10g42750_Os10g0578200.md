## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we show that the Oryza sativa cellulose synthase-like D1 (**OsCSLD1**) gene is required for root hair development, as rice (Oryza sativa) mutants that lack **OsCSLD1** function develop abnormal root hairs.
   - Because the csld1 mutants develop the same density and number of root hairs along their seminal root as the wild-type plants, we propose that **OsCSLD1** function is required for hair elongation but not initiation.
   - Both gene trap expression pattern and in situ hybridization analyses indicate that **OsCSLD1** is expressed in only root hair cells.
   - Given that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene KOJAK/AtCSLD3 is required for root hair elongation and is expressed in the root hair, it appears that **OsCSLD1** may be the functional ortholog of KOJAK/AtCSLD3 and that these two genes represent the root hair-specific members of this family of proteins.
   - **OsCSLD1**, a cellulose synthase-like D1 gene, is required for root hair morphogenesis in rice.
   - In situ hybridization showed that **OsCSLD1** was expressed not only in root hairs but also in epidermal and cortex cell walls except for stele.
   - qRT-PCR analysis revealed that **OsCSLD1** was expressed not only in root but also in shoot.
   - Root hairless 2 (rth2) mutant represents a loss-of-function allele of the cellulose synthase-like gene **OsCSLD1** in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - Positional cloning and complementation test revealed that the causal gene of rth2 was Cellulose Synthase-Like D1 (**OsCSLD1**).
   - Furthermore, **OsCSLD1** is the only member of the four rice CSLD genes that shows root-specific expression.
   - **OsCSLD1** Mediates NH(4)(+)-Dependent Root Hair Growth Suppression and AMT1;2 Expression in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
