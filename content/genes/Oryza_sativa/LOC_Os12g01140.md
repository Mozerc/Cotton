## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice **phot1a** mutation reduces plant growth by affecting photosynthetic responses to light during early seedling growth.
   - When **phot1a** mutants were grown under WL (100) and BL (40 miccromol m(-2) s(-1)), they demonstrated a considerable reduction in photosynthetic capacity, which included decreased leaf CO(2) uptake and plant growth.
   - We conclude that the defect of Os **phot1a** affects degradation of chlorophylls and carotenoids, and under photosynthetically active photon fluxes, mutation of **phot1a** results in loss of photosynthetic capacity owing to the damage of photosystems caused by elevated H(2)O(2) accumulation, leading to a reduction in plant growth.
