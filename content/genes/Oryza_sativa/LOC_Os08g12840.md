## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os08g12840](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os08g12840)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0225000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0225000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** ZL16
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZL16** was ubiquitously expressed in various plant organs, with a pronounced level in the young leaf.
   - The **ZL16** mutant showed chlorotic abnormalities in the transverse sectors of the young leaves of seedlings.
   - The use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that dramatic defects occurred in variegated **ZL16** leaves during the early development of a chloroplast.
   - A subcellular localization experiment indicated that **ZL16** was targeted in the chloroplast.
   - Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of some nuclear genes involved in chloroplast development, and found they were altered in the **ZL16** mutant.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **ZL16** encodes a <a6><c2>-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase (HAD) involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis.
