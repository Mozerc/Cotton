- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - oral development in antisense plants, as well as leaf emergence measurement indicating delayed leaf development under **OsPIPK1** deficiency, a common phenotype observed with earlier flowering.
   - RT-PCR analysis indicated that **OsPIPK1** was expressed almost constitutively in roots, shoots, stems, leaves and flowers, and upregulated following treatment with plant hormones or application of various stresses.
   - RT-PCR analysis and cDNA chip technology were used to examine transcripts of various genes in the transgenic plants and the results showed altered transcriptions of several flowering-time or - identity related genes, suggesting that **OsPIPK1** is involved in rice heading through regulation of.
   - **OsPIPK1**, a rice phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase, regulates rice heading by modifying the expression of floral induction genes.
