## Functional Descriptions:
   - In light of these observations, we hypothesize that IAA production in developing rice grains is controlled via expression of OsTAR1, OsYUC9, **OsYUC11** and that IAA may be important during starch deposition in addition to its previously suggested role early in grain development.
   - The increase in IAA content was strongly correlated with the expression of putative IAA biosynthesis genes, OsYUC9, **OsYUC11** and OsTAR1, measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
   - All three genes were expressed in endosperm; expression of **OsYUC11** appeared to be confined to endosperm tissue.
   - Suppression of RGB1 expression also resulted in the lower auxin content in grains, which was correlated with the lower expression of OsNF-YB1 and **OsYUC11** during grain filling stage.
   - OsNF-YB1, which acts as a key downstream effector of RGB1, interacts directly with the promoter of **OsYUC11** and stimulates the **OsYUC11** expression, thereby regulating auxin biosynthesis and starch accumulation and grain size.
   - A rice transcription factor (TF) yeast library was screened, and 41 TFs that potentially bind to the **OsYUC11** promoter were identified, of which OsNF-YB1, a member of the nuclear factor Y family, is predominantly expressed in the endosperm.
   - Here, we described rice YUCCA (YUC) flavin-containing monooxygenase encoding gene **OsYUC11** as a key contributor to auxin biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa) endosperm.
   - Both **OsYUC11** and osnf-yb1 mutants exhibited reduced seed size and increased chalkiness, accompanied by a reduction in indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis.
   - We also found that **OsYUC11** was a dynamically imprinted gene that predominantly expressed the paternal allele in the endosperm up to 10 d after fertilization (DAF) but then became a non-imprinted gene at 15 DAF.
   - Interestingly, under LL, the expression of **OsYUC11** was significantly downregulated, which subsequently resulted in reduced IAA in the developing rice spikelets, followed by poor activation of grain-filling enzymes.
