## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsDHODH1** gene is involved in salt and drought tolerance in rice.
   - Expression analysis indicated that **OsDHODH1** is upregulated by salt, drought and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold.
   - Overexpression of the **OsDHODH1** gene in rice increased the DHODH activity and enhanced plant tolerance to salt and drought stresses as compared with wild type and **OsDHODH1**-antisense transgenic plants.
   - Our findings reveal, for the first time, that cytosolic dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is involved in plant stress response and that **OsDHODH1** could be used in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to salt and drought.
   - By prokaryotic expression, we determined the enzymatic activity of **OsDHODH1** and found that overproduction of **OsDHODH1** significantly improved the tolerance of Escherichia coli cells to salt and osmotic stresses.
   - Our findings reveal that short-term exposure of rice seedlings to 1 mM SNP (Nitric oxide donor) applied exogenously for 1 h resulted in significant down-regulation of **OsDHODH1** expression in all rice cultivars.
   - These results collectively suggest a possible role of **OsDHODH1** and OsCcOX5b role in plant root growth during nitrosative stress responses.
   - Nitrosative stress-mediated inhibition of **OsDHODH1** gene expression suggests roots growth reduction in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - This study monitored the transcriptional response of **OsDHODH1** under nitrosative stress conditions relative to the transcripts accumulations for the core mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase1 (CcOX1) subunit, nuclear CcOX subunits 5b and 5c, two rice nitrate reductases (OsNIA1 and OsNIA2), and nitric oxide excess 1 (OsNOE1) genes.
