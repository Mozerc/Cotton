## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results strongly suggest the involvement of **OsIRL** in homeostasis of ROS.
   - These results suggest that the expression of **OsIRL** is positively regulated by phytohormones such as JA, and negatively by phytohormones such as SA, ABA.
   - Using Northern and Western blot analyses, the **OsIRL** gene and protein were shown to be down-regulated in young seedling roots treated with reduced glutathione (GSH) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), known quenchers of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
   - Expression of **OsIRL** was induced by treatment with a fungal elicitor and jasmonic acid as well as by inoculation with rice blast fungus.
   - Results showed that the **OsIRL** transgenic rice line activated by ABA treatment was tolerant against MV and G/GO-induced stress in rice leave and suspension-cultured cells.
   - A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, **OsIRL**, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor.
   - Treatment with salicylic acid (SA, 5 mM) strongly inhibited expression of **OsIRL** in response to fungal elicitor and JA, while abscisic acid (ABA, 200 muM) also strongly antagonized **OsIRL** induction by JA, but had only a weak effect on induction by the fungal elicitor.
