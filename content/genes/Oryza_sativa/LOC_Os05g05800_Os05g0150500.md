- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0150500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0150500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsTIR1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that **OsTIR1** and OsAFB2 interact with OsIAA1.
   - **OsTIR1** and OsAFB2 downregulation via OsmiR393 overexpression leads to more tillers, early flowering and less tolerance to salt and drought in rice.
   - In this study, we verified that two rice auxin receptor gene homologs (**OsTIR1** and OsAFB2) could be targeted by OsmiR393 (Os for Oryza sativa).
   - These data indicated that the phenotypes of OsmiR393-overexpressing rice may be caused through hyposensitivity to the auxin signal by reduced expression of two auxin receptor genes (**OsTIR1** and OsAFB2).
   - The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from **OsTIR1** and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering.
   - Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (**OsTIR1**)--were more abundant in the osarf12 and osarf12/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions.
   - * This study functionally characterizes two members of the rice (Oryza sativa) miR393 family and their target genes, **OsTIR1** and OsAFB2 (AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX), the two closest homologs of Arabidopsis TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1).
   - We created targeted **OsTIR1** and OsAFB2-5 mutations in rice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and functionally characterized the roles of these five members in plant growth and development and auxinic herbicide resistance.
   - Together with our previous discovery that the viral P2 protein stabilizes OsIAA10 protein via thwarting its interaction with **OsTIR1** to enhance viral infection and pathogenesis, our results reveal a novel auxin-IAA10-ARFs-mediated signaling mechanism employed by rice and RDV for defense and counter defense responses.
