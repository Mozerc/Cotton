## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **UXS** gene was expressed in mature, harvested rice seeds as well as in immature seeds 14 d post-anthesis, suggesting that the **UXS** gene is necessary at the beginning of the germination period.
   - These findings reveal **OsUXS3** as a direct target of OsDMI3 and demonstrate its involvement in antioxidant defense.
   - OsDMI3-mediated **OsUXS3** phosphorylation improves oxidative stress tolerance by modulating OsCATB protein abundance in rice..
   - Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that **OsUXS3** acts downstream of OsDMI3 to enhance the oxidative stress tolerance conferred by higher catalase (CAT) activity.
   - Indeed, **OsUXS3** interacted with CAT isozyme B (OsCATB), and this interaction was required to increase OsCATB protein abundance under oxidative stress conditions.
   - Our results indicate that OsDMI3 promotes the association of **OsUXS3** with OsCATB to enhance CAT activity under oxidative stress.
   - The expression of **OsUXS3** was significantly up-regulated under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments of rice seedlings.
   - The UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase **OsUXS3** regulates Na(+) ion toxicity tolerance under salt stress by interacting with OsCATs in rice..
   - Based on the results above, we can conclude that **OsUXS3** might regulate CAT activity by interacting with OsCATs, which is not only characterized for the first time but also regulating Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis, positively regulating the Na(+) ion toxicity tolerance under salt stress in rice.
   - Furthermore, knockout of **OsUXS3** caused excessive accumulation of Na (+) ion and rapid loss of K(+) ion and disrupts Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments.
   - Meanwhile, by the genetic and biochemical evidence, knockout of **OsUXS3** significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and decreased CAT activity under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments in tissue.
