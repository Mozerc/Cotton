- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0585200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0585200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsHIPP16
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Histochemical analysis with pHIPP16::GUS reveals that **OsHIPP16** is primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues.
   - Transgenic rice overexpressing **OsHIPP16** (OE) improved rice growth with increased plant height, biomass, and chlorophyll content but with a lower degree of oxidative injury and Cd accumulation, whereas knocking out **OsHIPP16** by CRISPR-Cas9 compromised the growth and physiological response.
   - **OsHIPP16** was strongly induced by Cd stress.
   - Expression of **OsHIPP16** in the yeast mutant strain ycf1 sensitive to Cd conferred cellular tolerance.
   - A metal chaperone **OsHIPP16** detoxifies cadmium by repressing its accumulation in rice crops.
   - These results suggest that adequate expression of **OsHIPP16** would profoundly contribute to Cd detoxification by regulating Cd accumulation in rice, suggesting that both OE and **OsHIPP16** mutant plants have great potentials for restricting Cd acquisition in the rice crop and phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated wetland soils.
