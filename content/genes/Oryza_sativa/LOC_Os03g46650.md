- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **RGB1** knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting **RGB1** to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1.
   - The number of sterile seeds also increased in both **RGB1** knock-down lines.
   - Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, **RGB1**, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions.
   - Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of **RGB1** function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5.
   - Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and **RGB1** play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.
   - In contrast, mRNA levels of **RGB1** (rice Gβ subunit) were significantly upregulated by ABA treatment and the lack of **RGB1** led to reduced drought tolerance.
   - Furthermore, the results suggested that qPE9-1 negatively regulates the ABA response by suppressing the expression of key transcription factors involved in ABA and stress responses, while **RGB1** positively regulates ABA biosynthesis by upregulating NCED gene expression under both normal and drought stress conditions.
   - Taken together, it is proposed that **RGB1** is a positive regulator of the ABA response and drought adaption in rice plants, whereas qPE9-1 is modulated by **RGB1** and functions as a negative regulator in the ABA-dependent drought-stress responses.
   - The dynamic anatomical characteristics of the embryos of the **RGB1** seedlings and WT during early postgermination and according to TUNEL assays showed that the suppressed growth of the **RGB1** mutants was caused by cell death.
   - In addition to the limited shoot and root development, the development of the embryo shoot-root axis was suppressed in the **RGB1** mutants.
   - **RGB1** was expressed mainly in the root epidermal and vascular tissues of the embryo.
   - The heterotrimeric G protein β subunit **RGB1** plays an important role in plant growth and development.
   - However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of rice growth by **RGB1** remain elusive.
   - The heterotrimeric G protein β subunit **RGB1** is required for seedling formation in rice.
   - Here, the **RGB1** mutants **RGB1**-1 (+ 1 bp), **RGB1**-2 (- 1 bp), and **RGB1**-3 (- 11 bp) were isolated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and they were arrested at 1 day after germination and ultimately exhibited seedling lethality.
   - Moreover, transcript profiling analysis revealed that the expression of a large number of auxin-, cytokinin-, and brassinosteroid-inducible genes was upregulated or downregulated in the **RGB1** mutant compared to the wild type during seedling development.
   - Overall, the **RGB1** mutants provide an ideal material for exploring the molecular mechanism underlying rice seedling formation during early postgermination development by G proteins.
   - The heterotrimeric G protein β subunit **RGB1** acts as a crucial factor in promoting early postgermination seedling development in rice.
