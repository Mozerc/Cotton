- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os11g0497000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os11g0497000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsSAE1a
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The qRT-PCR assay revealed a constitutive and variable spatiotemporal expression pattern of **OsSAE1a** in the vegetative and reproductive tissues and was comparable in the root and shoot grown under different Pi regimes.
   - Knockdown of **OsSAE1a** affects the growth and development and phosphate homeostasis in rice.
   - The effects of the mutation in **OsSAE1a** were also evident in the vegetative and reproductive traits of rice during growth in a hydroponic system and pot soil, respectively.
   - Overall, these results suggest a broad-spectrum role of **OsSAE1a** in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis and regulating growth and development.
   - RNAi-mediated suppression of **OsSAE1a** exerted variable effects on the concentrations of Pi and total P in different tissues, uptake and distribution of 32Pi, and relative expression levels of several genes that play pivotal roles in the maintenance of Pi homeostasis.
