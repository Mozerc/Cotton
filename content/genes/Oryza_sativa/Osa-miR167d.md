## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Osa-miR167d</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - By contrast, transgenic lines expressing a target mimicry to block **Osa-miR167d** enhanced resistance to rice blast disease.
   - **Osa-miR167d** belongs to a conserved miRNA family targeting auxin responsive factor (ARF) genes that act in developmental and stress-induced responses.
   - Transgenic rice lines over-expressing **Osa-miR167d** were highly susceptible to multiple blast fungal strains.
   - **Osa-miR167d** facilitates infection of Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.
   - Here, we show that **Osa-miR167d** plays a negative role in rice immunity against M.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **Osa-miR167d** negatively regulate rice immunity to facilitate the infection of M.
   - The expression of **Osa-miR167d** was significantly suppressed in a resistant accession at and after 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), however, its expression was significantly increased at 24 hpi in the susceptible accession upon M.
