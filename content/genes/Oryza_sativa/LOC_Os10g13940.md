- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0206800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0206800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsFRDL2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Al-induced inhibition of the root elongation was similar between the **OsFRDL2** knockout line and its wild type rice.
   - Functional analysis of a MATE gene **OsFRDL2** revealed its involvement in Al-induced secretion of citrate, but less contribution to Al tolerance in rice.
   - Furthermore, the expression of **OsFRDL2** was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type Zn-finger transcription factor for Al tolerance.
   - Collectively, our results indicate that although **OsFRDL2** is involved in the Al-induced secretion of citrate, its contribution to high Al tolerance is relatively small in rice.
