## Functional Descriptions:
   - Since Hrd3/SEL1L recognizes unfolded proteins in yeast and mammalian protein quality control systems, the role of **OsHrd3** in protein quality control in rice endosperm was investigated.
   - Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that **OsHrd3** interacts with components of the Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase complex such as OsOS-9 and OsHrd1 in rice protoplasts.
   - **OsHrd3** is necessary for maintaining the quality of endoplasmic reticulum-derived protein bodies in rice endosperm.
   - Endosperm-specific suppression of **OsHrd3** in transgenic rice reduced the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins and resulted in unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in the endosperm, suggesting that **OsHrd3**-mediated polyubiquitination plays an important role in ER quality control.
