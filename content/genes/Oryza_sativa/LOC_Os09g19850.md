## Functional Descriptions:
   - Phenotypic analysis revealed that the **AL2** mutation caused obvious albino leaves at the early developmental stage, eventually leading to **AL2** seedling death.
   - Electron microscopy investigations indicated that the chloroplast structure was disrupted in the **AL2** mutants at an early developmental stage and subsequently resulted in the breakdown of the entire chloroplast.
   - Molecular cloning illustrated that **AL2** encodes a chloroplast group IIA intron splicing facilitator (CRS1) in rice, which was confirmed by a genetic complementation experiment.
   - Interestingly, we found that the expression levels of a subset of chloroplast genes that contain group IIA and IIB introns were significantly reduced in the **AL2** mutant compared to that in the wild type, suggesting that **AL2** is a functional CRS1 in rice.
   - Differing from the orthologous CRS1 in maize and Arabidopsis that only regulates splicing of the chloroplast group II intron, our results demonstrated that the **AL2** gene is also likely to be involved in the splicing of the chloroplast group I intron.
   - They also showed that disruption of **AL2** results in the altered expression of chloroplast-associated genes, including chlorophyll biosynthetic genes, plastid-encoded polymerases and nuclear-encoded chloroplast genes.
