## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we report a wax-deficient rice mutant **OsHSD1** with reduced epicuticular wax crystals and thicker cuticle membrane.
   - Together, our data indicated that **OsHSD1** plays a specialized role in cuticle formation and lipid homeostasis, probably by mediating sterol signaling.
   - Furthermore, **OsHSD1** mutation resulted in faster protein degradation, but had no effect on the dehydrogenase activity.
   - **LGF1** regulates C30 primary alcohol synthesis, which is necessary for abundant epicuticular wax platelets, leaf hydrophobicity and gas films on submerged leaves.
   - Gene function was verified by a complementation test of **LGF1** expressed in the drp7 mutant background, which restored C30 primary alcohol synthesis, wax platelet abundance, leaf hydrophobicity, gas film retention, and underwater photosynthesis.
   - The discovery of **LGF1** provides an opportunity to better understand variation amongst rice genotypes for gas film retention ability and to target various alleles in breeding for improved submergence tolerance for yield stability in flood-prone areas.
