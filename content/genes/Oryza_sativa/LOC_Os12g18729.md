## Functional Descriptions:
   - The broad-spectrum rice blast resistance (R) gene **Pita2** encodes a novel R protein unique from Pita.
   - In this study, we compared the resistance spectra controlled by **Pita2** and Pita by testing their monogenic lines (MLs) in four hotspots found in the Philippines and Burundi from 2014 to 2018.
   - Pathogenicity tests using 328 single-spore isolates in greenhouse further verified that IRBLta2-Re for **Pita2** conferred a relatively broader spectrum resistance than those of Pita.
   - Moreover, based on the resistance gene analysis of rice varieties and mutants containing Pita, it was found that **Pita2** rather than Pita was responsible for the specificity to some differential isolates with AvrPita.
   - The diagnosis and survey of **Pita2** in IRRI released varieties showed relatively low frequency, implying a high value of its application for breeding resistant varieties against rice blast via marker assisted selection.
   - **Pita2** encodes a novel R protein unique from Pita, which is exactly identical to the previously cloned Ptr.
   - A cluster of resistant (R) genes on rice chromosome 12 including Pita, **Pita2** and Ptr has been studies for decades.
