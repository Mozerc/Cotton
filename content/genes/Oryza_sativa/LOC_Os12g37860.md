## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we found that **OsMOS1** promotes rice heading and affects its grain size.
   - In addition, knocking out **OsMOS1** led to larger grains with longer grain lengths and higher grain weights.
   - The seed cell size measurement showed that the cell lengths and cell widths of the outer glume epidermal cells of the **OsMOS1** mutant were greater than those of the wild type.
   - Furthermore, we also found that the overexpression of **OsMOS1** in the Arabidopsis&amp;amp;nbsp;mos1 mutant background could suppress its phenotypes of late flowering and increased seed size.
   - Thus, our study shows a conserved function of MOS1 in rice and Arabidopsis, and these findings shed light on the heading and seed size regulation in rice and suggest that **OsMOS1** is a promising target for rice yield improvement.
