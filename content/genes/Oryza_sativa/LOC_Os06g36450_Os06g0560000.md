## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os06g36450](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g36450)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0560000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0560000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsFPN1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In addition to the high Co and Ni in brown rice and shoots, the mutant also exhibited high Co and Ni concentrations in the xylem sap, but low concentrations in the roots, suggesting that **OsFPN1** is involved in the root-to-shoot translocation of Co and Ni.
   - The growth of 1187_n and CRISPR/Cas9 lines were suppressed under high Co and Ni condition, indicating **OsFPN1** is required for the normal growth under high Co and Ni.
   - Golgi-Localized **OsFPN1** is Involved in Co and Ni Transport and Their Detoxification in Rice..
   - These results suggest that **OsFPN1** can transport Co and Ni and is vital detoxification in rice.
   - Golgi-Localized **OsFPN1** is Involved in Co and Ni Transport and Their Detoxification in Rice.
