## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g01020](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g01020)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0100100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0100100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsPMEI12
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to edit the **OsPMEI12** (LOC_Os03G01020) and two mutant pmei12 lines were obtained to explore the functions of OsPMEI in plant growth and development, and under cadmium (Cd) stress.
   - These results indicated that **OsPMEI12** was involved in the regulation of methyl esterification during growth, affected cell wall composition and agronomic traits, and might play an important role in responses to phytohormones and stress.
