## Functional Descriptions:
   - The yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that **OsGSR1** interacts with DIM/DWF1, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion from 24-methylenecholesterol to campesterol in BR biosynthesis.
   - These results suggest that **OsGSR1** activates BR synthesis by directly regulating a BR biosynthetic enzyme at the post-translational level.
   - These results demonstrate that **OsGSR1** plays important roles in both BR and GA pathways, and also mediates an interaction between the two signaling pathways.
   - RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice plants with reduced **OsGSR1** expression show phenotypes similar to plants deficient in BR, including short primary roots, erect leaves and reduced fertility.
   - **OsGSR1** is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice.
   - Here, we demonstrate that **OsGSR1**, a member of the GAST (GA-stimulated transcript) gene family, is induced by GA and repressed by BR.
   - Furthermore, **OsGSR1** RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that **OsGSR1** is a positive regulator of GA signaling.
   - The **OsGSR1** RNAi transgenic rice shows a reduced level of endogenous BR, and the dwarf phenotype could be rescued by the application of brassinolide.
   - **GW6** is highly expressed in the young panicle and increases grain width by promoting cell expansion in the spikelet hull.
   - **GW6** is induced by GA and its knockout down-regulates the expression of GA biosynthesis genes and decreases GA contents in the young panicle.
   - A quantitative trait locus **GW6** controls rice grain size and yield through the gibberellin pathway.
   - Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a QTL, **GW6** (GRAIN WIDTH 6), which encodes a gibberellin-regulated GAST family protein and positively regulates grain width and weight.
   - The knockout of **GW6** exhibits reduced grain size and weight, whereas the overexpression of **GW6** results in increased grain size and weight.
   - We found that a natural variation in the cis element CAAT-box in the promoter of **GW6** is associated with its expression level and grain width and weight.
   - 44% increase in rice grain yield, indicating that **GW6** has great potential to improve grain yield in rice.
   - Natural variation in **OsGASR7** regulates grain length in rice.
