## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice histone deacetylase **HDA704** positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by controlling stomatal aperture and density.
   - **HDA704** enhances drought and salt tolerance via stomata-regulated mechanism.
   - In this study on rice, we identified the RPD3/HDA1-type histone deacetylase **HDA704** as a positive regulatory factor in drought and salt tolerance.
   - **HDA704** was induced by drought and salt stresses.
   - Overexpression of **HDA704** in transgenic rice promoted stomatal closure, decreased the number of stomata and slowed down the rate of water loss, consequently resulting in increased drought and salt tolerance.
   - By contrast, knockdown of **HDA704** in transgenic rice decreased stomatal closure and accelerated the rate of water loss, leading to decrease drought and salt tolerance.
   - Collectively, these findings reveal that **HDA704** positively regulates drought and salt tolerance by repressing the expression of DST and ABIL2.
   - **HDA704** negatively regulates stomatal aperture and density, repressing the transcription of DST and ABIL2 by histone deacetylation modification.
