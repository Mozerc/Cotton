## Functional Descriptions:
   - This paper presents evidence that **OsMAPK2** (Oryza sativa MAP kinase gene 2) is responsive to Pi deficiency and involved in Pi homeostasis.
   - Our results indicated that **OsMAPK2** enables tolerance phosphate deficiency and is involved in Pi homeostasis.
   - In suspension-cultured cells, the **OsMAPK2** mRNA transcript increased markedly upon temperature downshift from 26degreesC to 4degreesC and sucrose starvation.
   - In contrast, the **OsMAPK2** mRNA level rapidly declined in rice cell challenged by high temperature.
   - These results suggest that **OsBIMK1** plays an important role in rice disease resistance.
   - **OsBIMK1**, a rice MAP kinase gene involved in disease resistance responses.
   - Present results demonstrating dramatic transcriptional and transient regulation of the **OsMSRMK2** expression by diverse biotic/abiotic stresses, a first report for any rice (or plant) MAPK to date, suggest a role for **OsMSRMK2** in rice defense/stress response pathways.
   - Using in vitro system, we show that the expression of **OsMSRMK2** mRNA was potently enhanced within 15 min by signalling molecules, protein phosphatase inhibitors, ultraviolet irradiation, fungal elicitor, heavy metals, high salt and sucrose, and drought.
   - We found that full-length expression of **OsMAPK2** was up-regulated in both rice plants and cell culture in the absence of inorganic phosphate (Pi).
   - Overexpression of **OsMAPK2** Enhances Low Phosphate Tolerance in Rice and Arabidopsis thaliana.
   - By contrast, overexpression lines exhibited increased **OsMAPK5** kinase activity and increased tolerance to drought, salt, and cold stresses.
   - Expression of **OsBIMK1** was activated rapidly upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH) as well as with dichloroisonicotinic acid, probenazole, jasmonic acid and its methyl ester, Pseudomonas syringae pv.
   - These results strongly suggest that **OsMAPK5** can positively regulate drought, salt, and cold tolerance and negatively modulate PR gene expression and broad-spectrum disease resistance.
   - The transgenic rice and Arabidopsis plants overexpressing **OsMAPK2** showed affected root development and increased plant Pi content compared with wild-type plants.
   - **OsMSRMK2** expression was further modulated by co-application of JA, salicylic acid, and ethylene and required de novo synthesized protein factor(s) in its transient regulation.
   - Nipponbare) C(2) H(2) -type ZFP ZFP182 in ABA-induced antioxidant defense and the relationship between ZFP182 and two rice MAPKs, OsMPK1 and **OsMPK5** in ABA signaling were investigated.
   - Nipponbare), we identified a single copy gene called **OsMSRMK2** from jasmonic acid (JA) treated rice seedling leaf cDNA library.
   - Overexpression of **OsMAPK2** controlled the expression of several Pi starvation-responsive genes.
   - Analysis at the mRNA level has shown that **OsMAPK2** is expressed in all plant organs and high relative amounts of **OsMAPK2** were detected in the mature panicles in comparison with in the immature panicles.
   - These results suggest that this **OsMAPK2** may function in the stress-signalling pathway as well as panicle development in rice.
   - The **OsMAPK2** gene has been found to function in plant tolerance to diverse biotic/abiotic stresses.
   - A similarly rapid response of **OsMAPK2** was observed in stress-treated seedlings, demonstrating that response of the MAPK pathway occurs also in intact plants.
   - The **OsMAPK5** gene, its protein, and kinase activity were inducible by abscisic acid as well as various biotic (pathogen infection) and abiotic (wounding, drought, salt, and cold) stresses.
   - Taken together, these results lead us to conclude that at least two signaling pathways for low temperature stress exist in rice, and that a MAP kinase pathway with OsMEK1 and **OsMAP1** components is possibly involved in the signaling for the higher range low-temperature stress.
   - Two novel mitogen-activated protein signaling components, OsMEK1 and **OsMAP1**, are involved in a moderate low-temperature signaling pathway in rice.
   - Moreover, high (37 degrees C) and low temperatures (12 degrees C) and environmental pollutants-ozone and sulfur dioxide-differentially regulate the **OsMSRMK2** mRNA accumulation in leaves of intact plants.
   - ABA treatment induced the increases in the expression of ZFP182, OsMPK1 and **OsMPK5**, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in rice leaves.
   - Besides, OsMPK1 and **OsMPK5** were shown to be required for the up-regulation in the expression of ZFP182 in ABA signaling, but ZFP182 did not mediate the ABA-induced up-regulation in the expression of OsMPK1 and **OsMPK5**.
   - primes) the transcription, accumulation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase **OsMPK3** as well as the expression of the downstream WRKY transcription factor OsWRKY70 and several jasmonate biosynthesis genes, resulting in a higher accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA).
   - Using transgenic plants defective in early signaling, we show that **OsMPK3** is required, and that OsMPK6 and OsWRKY70 contribute to indole-mediated defense priming of JA-dependent herbivore resistance.
   - It was observed that OsMPK6 overexpression lines had a more robust and spread out root architectural system while **OsMPK3** overexpression lines had a typical bushy phenotype.
