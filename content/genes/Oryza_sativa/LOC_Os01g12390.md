## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis revealed that **OsSRLK** leaves maintained the chloroplast structure with intact grana stacks during dark incubation; however, the retained green color and preserved chloroplast structures of **OsSRLK** did not enhance the photosynthetic competence during age-dependent senescence in autumn.
   - The detached leaves of **OsSRLK** mutant (**OsSRLK**) contained more green pigment than those of the wild type (WT) during dark-induced senescence (DIS).
   - In **OsSRLK**, the panicles per plant was increased and the spikelets per panicle were reduced, resulting in similar grain productivity between WT and **OsSRLK**.
   - By transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing, genes related to phytohormone, senescence, and chlorophyll biogenesis were significantly altered in **OsSRLK** compared to those in WT during DIS.
   - HPLC and immunoblot assay revealed that degradation of chlorophyll and photosystem II proteins was repressed in **OsSRLK** during DIS.
