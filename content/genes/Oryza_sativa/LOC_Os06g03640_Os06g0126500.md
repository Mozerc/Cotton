- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0126500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0126500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsBAG3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining further indicated that **OsBAG3** is mainly involved in primary young tissues under both primary and secondary growth.
   - The co-expression analysis and the hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that the OsBAG1 and **OsBAG3** were co-expressed with primary cell wall-biosynthesizing genes, OsBAG4 was co-expressed with phytohormone and transcriptional factors, and OsBAG6 was co-expressed with disease and shock-associated genes.
