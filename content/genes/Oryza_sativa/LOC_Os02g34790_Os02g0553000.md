## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g34790](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g34790)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0553000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0553000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** XIK1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - By using RNA interference (RNAi), we silenced the expression of **XIK1** in rice with Xa21 and found that reduced expression of **XIK1** compromised disease resistance mediated by XA21.
   - Our study reveals that the LRR-RLK gene **XIK1** is Xoo-responsive and positively regulates Xa21-mediated disease resistance.
   - Expression pattern analysis reveals that **XIK1** is preferentially expressed in reproductive leaves and panicles, and that expression is associated with plant development.
   - In addition, we found that the expression of the downstream marker genes of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) in rice was compromised in Xa21 plants silenced for **XIK1**.
