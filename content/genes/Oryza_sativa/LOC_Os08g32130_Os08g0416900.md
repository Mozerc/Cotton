## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os08g32130](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os08g32130)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0416900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0416900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsV5B
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Differential protein abundances of OsV5A and **OsV5B** in rice seedlings at different leaf developmental stages were also revealed.
   - Deficiency of OsV5A and **OsV5B** occurred in pre-emerged and emerging leaves in osv5a seedlings at 22 Â°C, leading to reduced POR accumulation and chlorophyll content.
   - OsV5A apparently developed a specialized role for regulating POR abundances at the leaf pre-emergence stage while the same function is performed by **OsV5B** during leaf emergence and expansion.
   - Both OsV5A and **OsV5B** are localized in the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membranes.
   - OsV5A and **OsV5B** interact with two rice PORs (OsPORA and OsPORB) inside chloroplasts and they stabilize OsPORB in vitro under oxidative stress.
