- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os09g0520400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os09g0520400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsbZIP76
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - As a putative  transcription factor, **OsbZIP76** alone lacked transcriptional activation activity;  however, it interacted with the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family transcription factors OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YB1 in yeast and in planta.
   - Genes involved in endosperm development or starch biosynthesis were prematurely activated in the **OsbZIP76** caryopsis.
   - In summary, **OsbZIP76** is an endosperm-expressed imprinted gene that regulates endosperm development in rice.
   - **OsbZIP76** interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice  (Oryza sativa)..
   - **OsbZIP76** and OsNF-YB9 were  predominantly expressed in the endosperm and the proteins colocalized.
   - **OsbZIP76** interacts with OsNF-YBs and regulates endosperm cellularization in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Seeds of osnf-yb1 and **OsbZIP76** mutants showed reduced size and reduced apparent amylose content..
