## Functional Descriptions:
   - It is assumed that interaction between GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) and the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of **SLR1** triggers F-box protein GID2-mediated **SLR1** degradation.
   - We identified a semidominant dwarf mutant, **SLR1**-d4, which contains a mutation in the region encoding the C-terminal GRAS domain of **SLR1** (**SLR1**(G576V)).
   - Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), GID2 and **SLR1**.
   - GA perception by GID1 causes **SLR1** protein degradation involving the F-box protein GID2; this triggers GA-associated responses such as shoot elongation and seed germination.
   - We also succeeded in producing GA-insensitive dwarf rice by transforming wild-type rice with a modified **SLR1** gene construct that has a 17â€“amino acid deletion affecting the DELLA region.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the dwarf phenotype in these mutants was caused by gain-of-function mutations in the N-terminal region of **SLR1**.
   - Isolation and characterization of dominant dwarf mutants, **SLR1**-d, in rice.
   - These results indicate that constitutive activation of the GA signal transduction pathway by the **SLR1**-1 mutation promotes the endogenous ABA level.
   - The slender rice (**SLR1**-1) mutant, carrying a lethal and recessive single mutation, has a constitutive gibberellin (GA)-response phenotype and behaves as if it were saturated with GAs [Ikeda et al.
   - Overexpression of **SLR1** in wild-type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by EL1 deficiency, indicating the negative effect of **SLR1** on GA signalling requires the EL1 function.
   - The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in dgl1 is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein **SLR1** was triggered by GA3 in this mutant.
   - The **SLR1** gene, with sequence homology to members of the plant-specific GRAS gene family, is a mediator of the GA signal transduction process.
   - SLR1 maps to **OsGAI** in rice and has significant homology with height-regulating genes, such as RHT-1Da in wheat, D8 in maize, and GAI and RGA in Arabidopsis.
   - slender Rice, a Constitutive Gibberellin Response Mutant, Is Caused by a Null Mutation of the **SLR1** Gene, an Ortholog of the Height-Regulating Gene GAI/RGA/RHT/D8.
   - Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein **SLR1** to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling.
   - When **SLR1** proteins with various deletions were over-expressed in rice, the severity of dwarfism correlated with the transactivation activity observed in yeast, indicating that **SLR1** suppresses plant growth through transactivation activity.
   - In GA-insensitive and GA biosynthesis mutants, SLENDER RICE1 (**SLR1**) accumulates to high levels, and the severity of dwarfism is usually correlated with the level of **SLR1** accumulation.
   - An exception is the GA-insensitive F-box mutant gid2, which shows milder dwarfism than mutants such as gid1 and cps even though it accumulates higher levels of **SLR1**.
   - The level of **SLR1** protein in gid2 was decreased by loss of GID1 function or treatment with a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, and dwarfism was enhanced.
   - Conversely, overproduction of GID1 or treatment with GA(3) increased the **SLR1** level in gid2 and reduced dwarfism.
   - Further studies showed that the phosphorylation of **SLR1** is important for maintaining its activity and stability, and mutation of the candidate phosphorylation site of **SLR1** results in the altered GA signalling.
   - GID2, an F-box subunit of the SCF E3 complex, specifically interacts with phosphorylated **SLR1** protein and regulates the gibberellin-dependent degradation of **SLR1** in rice.
   - **SLR1**-GFP worked in nuclei to repress the GA signaling pathway; its overproduction caused a dwarf phenotype.
   - The rice **SLR1** (SLENDER RICE 1) gene encodes a DELLA protein that belongs to a subfamily of the GRAS protein superfamily and that functions as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling.
   - The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, **SLR1**, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis.
   - This indicates that the function of OsSPY in GA signaling is not via changes in the amount or stability of **SLR1**, but probably involves control of the suppressive function of **SLR1**.
   - The rice slender mutant (**SLR1**-1) is caused by a single recessive mutation and results in a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype.
   - Notably Sub1A increased the accumulation of the GA signaling repressors Slender Rice-1 (**SLR1**) and **SLR1** Like-1 (SLRL1) and concomitantly diminished GA-inducible gene expression under submerged conditions.
   - Together, these results demonstrate that Sub1A limits ethylene-promoted GA responsiveness during submergence by augmenting accumulation of the GA signaling repressors **SLR1** and SLRL1.
   - In the Sub1A overexpression line, **SLR1** protein levels declined under prolonged submergence but were accompanied by an increase in accumulation of SLRL1, which lacks the DELLA domain.
   - Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by **SLR1** and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice.
   - These results indicate that the product of the **SLR1** gene is an intermediate of the GA signal transduction pathway.
   - Furthermore, introduction of a 6-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild-type **SLR1** gene into the **SLR1**-1 mutant restored GA sensitivity to normal.
   - Thus, we demonstrate opposite GA response phenotypes depending on the type of mutations in **SLR1**.
   - Application of GA(3) to **SLR1**-GFP overproducers induced GA actions such as shoot elongation, downregulation of GA 20-oxidase expression, and upregulation of **SLR1** expression linked with the disappearance of the nuclear **SLR1**-GFP protein.
   - The rice (Oryza sativa) DELLA protein **SLR1** acts as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling.
   - Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein **SLR1** by gibberellin does not require **SLR1** degradation in the gid2 mutant.
   - These results indicate that derepression of **SLR1** repressive activity can be accomplished by GA and GID1 alone and does not require F-box (GID2) function.
   - Evidence for GA signaling without GID2 was also provided by the expression behavior of GA-regulated genes such as GA-20oxidase1, GID1, and **SLR1** in the gid2 mutant.
   - The C-terminal GRAS domain of **SLR1** also exhibits a suppressive function on plant growth, possibly by directly or indirectly interacting with the promoter region of target genes.
   - Based on the constitutive GA response phenotype of **SLR1** mutants, **SLR1** has been thought to be the sole DELLA-type protein suppressing GA signals in rice.
   - However, the repressive activity of SLRL1 against GA signaling was much weaker than a truncated **SLR1** lacking the DELLA domain.
   - This activity was suppressed by the GA-dependent GID1-**SLR1** interaction, which may explain why GA responses are induced in the presence of GA.
   - Our results indicate that the N-terminal region of **SLR1** has two roles in GA signaling: interaction with GID1 and transactivation activity.
   - The slender rice1 mutant (**SLR1**) shows a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype.
   - Furthermore, apart from the alteration of expression levels of the gibberellin biosynthesis genes, accumulation of **SLR1** protein was found in the overexpressing transgenic plants, indicating that the expression level of EUI1 is implicated in both gibberellin-mediated **SLR1** destruction and a feedback regulation in gibberellin biosynthesis.
   - The DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (**SLR1**) is a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling in rice (Oryza sativa), and most of the GA-associated responses are induced upon **SLR1** degradation.
   - The analyses revealed that the **SLR1** protein can be divided into four parts: a GA signal perception domain located at the N terminus, a regulatory domain for its repression activity, a dimer formation domain essential for signal perception and repression activity, and a repression domain at the C terminus.
   - We conclude that GA signal transduction is regulated by the appearance or disappearance of the nuclear **SLR1** protein, which is controlled by the upstream GA signal.
   - GA Perception and Signal Transduction: Molecular Interactions of the GA Receptor GID1 with GA and the DELLA Protein **SLR1** in Rice.
   - Together these findings favor a model whereby **SLR1** acts as a positive regulator of hemibiotroph resistance in rice by integrating and amplifying SA- and JA-dependent defense signaling.
   - Moreover, contrary to the differential effect of DELLA on the archetypal defense hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in Arabidopsis, we demonstrate that the resistance-promoting effect of **SLR1** is due at least in part to its ability to boost both SA- and JA-mediated rice defenses.
   - The DELLA protein **SLR1** integrates and amplifies salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent innate immunity in rice.
   - In a reciprocal manner, we found JA and SA treatment to interfere with GA metabolism and stabilize **SLR1**.
   - <U+00A0>graminicola, and **SLR1** plays a central role in the JA-mediated defense response in rice against this nematode.
   - Expression of **SLR1** and five key GA biosynthetic genes were disturbed in **SLR1**-d6 and the interaction between **SLR1**-d6 and GID1 was decreased.
   - Characterization of a new semi-dominant dwarf allele of **SLR1** and its potential application in hybrid rice breeding.
   - **SLR1** inhibits MOC1 degradation to coordinate tiller number and plant height in rice.
   - This discovery provides a molecular explanation for the coordinated control of plant height and tiller number in rice by GAs, **SLR1** and MOC1.
   - The protein levels of OsIDD2 were unaffected by GA in the wild type and OsIDD2OE plants, implying that OSIDD2 promotes the expression of miR396 and likely requires the coactivator of **SLR1**.
   - Furthermore, salt induces OsPIL14 turnover but enhances **SLR1** accumulation.
   - OsGRAS39 was found to be a highly expressive gene under sheath blight infection and both abiotic stress treatments while OsGRAS8, OsSHR1 and **OsSLR1** were also responsive.
   - **SLR1**-mediated broad-spectrum resistance was subverted by these independently evolved viral proteins, which all interrupted the functional crosstalk between **SLR1** and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling.
   - Viral proteins encoded by different types of rice viruses all directly trigger the rapid degradation of **SLR1** by promoting association with the GA receptor OsGID1.
   - Moreover, under the low-temperature (LT) condition, the osmkkk62/70 mutant had slightly higher Gibberellin (GA) contents, increased expression of GA biosynthesis genes, and lower protein level of **OsSLR1** in anthers than those in WT.
