## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tissue-specific gene expression analysis revealed that **OsPM19L1** was highly expressed in the leaf sheath of rice.
   - Interestingly, expression of **OsPM19L1** was high at the early stage of panicle development and decreased thereafter.
   - qRT-PCR analysis indicated that **OsPM19L1** was dramatically induced by 20% PEG stress (&gt;600-fold), exogenous abscisic acid (&gt;350-fold), salt and cold stress.
   - Thus, **OsPM19L1** appears to be closely associated with stress tolerance through ABA-dependent pathway in rice.
   - Characterization of **OsPM19L1** encoding an AWPM-19-like family protein that is dramatically induced by osmotic stress in rice..
   - Moreover, under stress conditions, **OsPM19L1** expression was enhanced in an ABI5-Like1 (ABL1) deficiency rice mutant, abl1, suggesting that ABL1 negatively regulates **OsPM19L1** gene expression.
   - Further investigation revealed that **OsPM1** expression is regulated by the AREB/ABF family transcription factor OsbZIP46.
   - Phenotypic analysis of overexpression, RNA interference (RNAi), and knock out (KO) lines showed that **OsPM1** is involved in drought responses and seed germination regulation.
   - The AWPM-19 Family Protein **OsPM1** Mediates Abscisic Acid Influx and Drought Response in Rice..
   - Our results thus revealed that **OsPM1** is an ABA influx carrier that plays an important role in drought responses.
   - In this study, we found that rice (Oryza sativa) **OsPM1** (PLASMA MEMBRANE PROTEIN 1), encoded by a gene of AWPM-19 like family, mediates ABA influx through the plasma membrane.
   - 3H-(<a1><c0>)ABA transport activity and FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) assays both demonstrated that **OsPM1** facilitates ABA uptake into cells.
   - Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of OsNAC45 enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that OsNAC45 may regulate the expression of two specific genes, **OsPM1** and OsLEA3-1.
