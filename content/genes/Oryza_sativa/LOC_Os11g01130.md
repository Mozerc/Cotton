## Functional Descriptions:
   - In order to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms of rice (Oryza sativa) organ development, we studied the narrow leaf2 narrow leaf3 (**NAL2** nal3; hereafter **NAL2**/3) double mutant, which produces narrow-curly leaves, more tillers, fewer lateral roots, opened spikelets and narrow-thin grains.
   - Expression levels of several leaf development-associated genes were altered in **NAL2**/3, and auxin transport-related genes were significantly changed, leading to pin mutant-like phenotypes such as more tillers and fewer lateral roots.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that NAL2 and NAL3 are paralogs that encode an identical **OsWOX3A** (OsNS) transcriptional activator, homologous to NARROW SHEATH1 (NS1) and NS2 in maize and PRESSED FLOWER in Arabidopsis.
   - **OsWOX3A** is involved in organ development in rice, lateral-axis outgrowth and vascular patterning in leaves, lemma and palea morphogenesis in spikelets, and development of tillers and lateral roots.
   - The rice narrow leaf2 and narrow leaf3 loci encode WUSCHEL-related homeobox 3A (**OsWOX3A**) and function in leaf, spikelet, tiller and lateral root development.
   - Thus, **NAL2**/3 can be used to modulate leaf shape and improve agronomic yield in crop plants.
   - Rice YAB3 is closely related to maize (Zea mays) ZmYAB14 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL), whereas rice **WOX3** is highly conserved with maize narrow sheath1 (NS1) and NS2 and Arabidopsis PRESSED FLOWER (PRS).
   - Here, we report the characterization of functional relationship between rice (Oryza sativa) YAB3 and **WOX3** in rice leaf development.
   - These data reveal a regulatory network involving YAB3, **WOX3**, and KNOX genes required for rice leaf development.
   - The narrow-leaf phenotype of FL90 shows a two-factor recessive inheritance and is caused by the loss of function of two WUSCHEL-related homeobox genes, **NAL2** and NAL3 (**NAL2**/3), which are duplicate genes orthologous to maize NS1 and NS2 and to Arabidopsis PRS.
   - The overexpression of **NAL2**/3 in transgenic rice plants results in wider leaves containing increased numbers of veins, suggesting that **NAL2**/3 expression regulates leaf width.
   - These data indicate that **OsWOX3A** is a GA-responsive gene and functions in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthetic pathway for GA homeostasis to maintain the threshold levels of endogenous GA intermediates throughout development.
   - Exogenous GA3 treatment fully rescued the developmental defects of **OsWOX3A**-OX plants, suggesting that constitutive overexpression of **OsWOX3A** downregulates GA biosynthesis.
   - **OsWOX3A** expression is drastically and temporarily upregulated by GA3 and downregulated by paclobutrazol, a blocker of GA biosynthesis.
   - Among the rice (Oryza sativa) WOX proteins, a loss of **OsWOX3A** function in narrow leaf2 (nal2) nal3 double mutants (termed nal2/3) causes pleiotropic effects, such as narrow and curly leaves, opened spikelets, narrow grains, more tillers, and fewer lateral roots, but almost normal plant height.
   - Regulatory role of the **OsWOX3A** transcription factor in rice root development.
   - These findings indicate that **OsWOX3A** may be involved in modulation of GA-auxin crosstalk in rice root development.
   - In a recent study, we demonstrated that **OsWOX3A** directly binds to the promoter of the KAO gene, which encodes ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, an enzyme involved in GA biosynthesis, and represses KAO expression.
   - Interestingly, we observed that **OsWOX3A** overexpression causes not only severe dwarfism, but also an increase in the number of lateral roots.
   - Transformation with modified OsARF11, OsARF16 and **OsWOX3A** genomic DNA lacking uORFs rescued the narrow leaf phenotype of nal21 to a better extent than transformation with their native genomic DNA, implying that RPS3A could regulate translation of ARFs and WOX3A through uORFs.
