## Functional Descriptions:
   - Collectively, our findings establish **OsNF-YA3** as an important transcription factor that positively modulates GA-regulated plant growth and negatively controls ABA-mediated water-deficit and salt tolerance.
   - **OsNF-YA3** regulates plant growth and osmotic stress tolerance by interacting with SLR1 and SAPK9 in rice..
   - **OsNF-YA3** loss-of-function mutants exhibit stunted growth, compromised GA biosynthetic gene expression, and decreased GA levels, while its overexpression lines have promoted growth and enhanced GA content.
   - Furthermore, OSMOTIC STRESS/ABA-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 9 (SAPK9), the positive component in ABA signaling, interacts with **OsNF-YA3** and mediates **OsNF-YA3** phosphorylation, resulting in its degradation in plants.
   - On the other side, **OsNF-YA3** negatively regulates plant osmotic stress tolerance by repressing ABA response.
   - **OsNF-YA3** reduces ABA levels by transcriptionally regulating ABA catabolic genes OsABA8ox1 and OsABA8ox3 by binding to their promoters.
   - Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and transient transcriptional regulation assays demonstrate that **OsNF-YA3** activates GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox1 expression.
