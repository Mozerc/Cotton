- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0440900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0440900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsI-BAK1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Down regulation of **OsI-BAK1** caused a reduction in cell number and enlargement in leaf bulliform cells.
   - Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsI-BAK1** were demonstrated to have corrugated and twisted leaves probably due to increased cell number that caused abnormal bulliform cell structure which were enlarged and plugged deep into leaf epidermis.
   - The current findings suggest that **OsI-BAK1** may play an important role in the developmental processes of rice grain filling and leaf cell including the bulliform cells.
   - Histological analyses demonstrated that embryos were either absent or retarded in their development in these unfilled rice grains of **OsI-BAK1** RNAi plants.
   - Silencing a Simple Extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat Gene **OsI-BAK1** Enhances the Resistance of Rice to Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.
   - These findings suggest that **OsI-BAK1** acts as a negative modulator of defense responses in rice to BPH and that BPH might exploit this modulator for its own benefit.
   - Silencing **OsI-BAK1** (ir-ibak1) in rice enhanced the BPH-induced transcript levels of three defense-related WRKY genes (OsWRKY24, OsWRKY53 and OsWRKY70) but decreased the induced levels of ethylene.
   - Here, we found that a simple eLRR protein **OsI-BAK1** in rice localizes to the plasma membrane.
