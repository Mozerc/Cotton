## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsNAP**-overexpressing transgenic plants displayed an accelerated leaf senescence phenotype at the grain-filling stage, which might be caused by the elevated JA levels and the increased expression of the JA biosynthesis-related genes LOX2 and AOC1, and showed enhanced tolerance ability to MeJA treatment at the seedling stage.
   - Analysis of the **OsNAP** transcript levels in rice showed that this gene was significantly induced by ABA and abiotic stresses, including high salinity, drought and low temperature.
   - The NAC family transcription factor **OsNAP** confers abiotic stress response through the ABA pathway.
   - RESULTS: In this study, we reported a member of the NAC transcription factor family named **OsNAP** whose expression is associated with leaf senescence, and investigated its preliminary function during the process of leaf senescence.
   - The results of qRT-PCR showed that the **OsNAP** transcripts were accumulated gradually in response to leaf senescence and treatment with methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA).
   - Nevertheless, the leaf senescence process was delayed in **OsNAP** RNAi transgenic plants with a dramatic drop in JA levels and with decreased expression levels of the JA biosynthesis-related genes AOS2, AOC1 and OPR7.
   - CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that **OsNAP** acts as a positive regulator of leaf senescence and this regulation may occur via the JA pathway.
   - Rice plants overexpressing **OsNAP** did not show growth retardation, but showed a significantly reduced rate of water loss, enhanced tolerance to high salinity, drought and low temperature at the vegetative stage, and improved yield under drought stress at the flowering stage.
   - Our data suggest that **OsNAP** functions as a transcriptional activator that plays a role in mediating abiotic stress responses in rice.
   - **OsNAP** is a member of the NAC transcription factor family; it is localized in the nucleus, and shows transcriptional activator activity in yeast.
   - Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing **OsNAP** revealed that many stress-related genes were up-regulated, including OsPP2C06/OsABI2, OsPP2C09, OsPP2C68 and OsSalT, and some genes coding for stress-related transcription factors (OsDREB1A, OsMYB2, OsAP37 and OsAP59).
   - **OsNAP** connects abscisic acid and leaf senescence by fine-tuning abscisic acid biosynthesis and directly targeting senescence-associated genes in rice.
   - Additionally, reduced **OsNAP** expression leads to delayed leaf senescence and an extended grain-filling period, resulting in a 6.3% and 10.3% increase in the grain yield of two independent representative RNAi lines, respectively..
   - Thus, fine-tuning **OsNAP** expression should be a useful strategy for improving rice yield in the future.
