## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsARD1** mRNA levels showed a rapid, early and transient increase upon submergence and after treatment with ethylene-releasing compounds.
   - Promoter analysis suggests that immediate-early regulation of **OsARD1** by ethylene may involve an EIN3-like transcription factor.
   - **OsARD1** transcripts accumulated in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, indicating that **OsARD1** is a primary ethylene response gene.
   - **OsARD1** is induced by low levels of ethylene.
   - The immediate-early ethylene response gene **OsARD1** encodes an acireductone dioxygenase involved in recycling of the ethylene precursor S-adenosylmethionine.
   - In deepwater rice, submergence enhances ethylene biosynthesis, and ethylene in turn influences the methionine cycle through positive feedback regulation of the acireductone dioxygenase gene **OsARD1**.
   - Subcellular localization shows that **OsARD1** displays strong localization signal in cell nucleus, suggesting **OsARD1** may interact with the transcription factors.
   - Here, we report that overexpression of **OsARD1** elevates the endogenous ethylene release rate, enhances the tolerance to submergence stress, and reduces the sensitivity to drought, salt, and osmotic stresses in rice.
   - Transgenic plants overexpressing **OsARD1** (**OsARD1**-OE) display fast elongation growth to escape submergence stress.
   - Overexpression of **OsARD1** Improves Submergence, Drought, and Salt Tolerances of Seedling Through the Enhancement of Ethylene Synthesis in Rice.
   - Taken together, the results provide the understanding of the function of **OsARD1** in ethylene synthesis and abiotic stress response in rice.
   - In rice, **OsARD1** binds Fe2+ and catalyzes the formation of 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB) to produce methionine, which is an initial substrate in ethylene synthesis pathway.
