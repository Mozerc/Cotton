## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PTC1** encodes a PHD-finger (for plant homeodomain) protein, which is expressed specifically in tapetal cells and microspores during anther development in stages 8 and 9, when the wild-type tapetal cells initiate a typical apoptosis-like cell death.
   - Microarray analysis indicated that 2,417 tapetum- and microspore-expressed genes, which are principally associated with tapetal development, degeneration, and pollen wall formation, had changed expression in **PTC1** anthers.
   - Moreover, the regulatory role of **PTC1** in anther development was revealed by comparison with MS1 and other rice anther developmental regulators.
   - These findings suggest a diversified and conserved switch of **PTC1**/MS1 in regulating programmed male reproductive development in both dicots and monocots, which provides new insights in plant anther development.
   - The evolutionary significance of **PTC1** was revealed by partial genetic complementation of the homologous mutation MALE STERILITY1 (MS1) in the dicot Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
   - Here, we report a key regulator in monocot rice (Oryza sativa), PERSISTANT TAPETAL CELL1 (**PTC1**), which controls programmed tapetal development and functional pollen formation.
   - Even though **PTC1** mutants show phenotypic similarity to ms1 in a lack of tapetal DNA fragmentation, delayed tapetal degeneration, as well as abnormal pollen wall formation and aborted microspore development, the **PTC1** mutant displays a previously unreported phenotype of uncontrolled tapetal proliferation and subsequent commencement of necrosis-like tapetal death.
   - **OsMS1** functions as a transcriptional activator to regulate programmed tapetum development and pollen exine formation in rice.
   - **OsMS1** functions as a transcriptional activator and interacts with known tapetal regulatory factors through its plant homeodomain (PHD) regulating tapetal programmed cell death (PCD) and pollen exine formation in rice.
   - In addition, cytological observation revealed delayed tapetal PCD, defective pollen exine formation and a lack of DNA fragmentation according to a TUNEL analysis in the anthers of **OsMS1** mutant.
   - Results of qPCR suggested that the expression of the genes associated with tapetal PCD and pollen wall biosynthesis, such as EAT1, AP37, AP25, OsC6 and OsC4, were significantly reduced in **OsMS1** mutant.
   - Taken together, our results demonstrate that the interaction of **OsMS1** with known tapetal regulatory factors through its PHD finger regulates tapetal PCD and pollen exine formation in rice.
   - **OsMS1** associates with the transcription factor TDR to regulate expression of downstream genes in a temperature-dependent manner.
   - A natural allele of **OsMS1** responds to temperature changes and confers thermosensitive genic male sterility.
   - Temperature regulates the abundances of **OsMS1** and **OsMS1**(wenmin1) proteins.
   - The high temperature causes more reduction of **OsMS1**(wenmin1) than **OsMS1** in nuclei.
   - Here, we show that **OsMS1** is a histone binding protein, and its natural allele **OsMS1**(wenmin1) confers thermosensitive male sterility in rice.
   - **OsMS1** is primarily localized in nuclei, while **OsMS1**(wenmin1) is localized in nuclei and cytoplasm.
