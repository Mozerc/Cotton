## Functional Descriptions:
   - Double-target in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that **sle1** was expressed specifically during the M-phase of the cell cycle, and suggested that the cell-cycle regulation was altered in **sle1** mutants.
   - Analysis of **OsCD1** promoter with GUS fusion expression shows that **OsCD1** exhibits higher expression in young meristem tissues such as fresh roots, young panicle and stem apical meristem.
   - To understand the molecular mechanism of leaf morphogenesis, we identified a rice mutant **NRL1**, which was characterized by a phenotype of narrow and rolled leaves.
   - We isolated three allelic mutants of NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 1 (**NRL1**) which showed phenotypes of reduced leaf width and semi-rolled leaves and different degrees of dwarfism.
   - The NRL1 gene was mapped to the chromosome 12 and encodes the cellulose synthase-like protein D4 (**OsCSLD4**).
   - We conclude that **OsCSLD4** encoded by NRL1 plays a critical role in leaf morphogenesis and vegetative development in rice.
   - Cell wall composition analysis reveals that cellulose content and the level of xylose are significantly reduced in mature culm owing to loss of **OsCD1** function.
   - We report here an in-depth characterization of a narrow leaf and dwarf1 (**ND1**) rice mutant that shows significant reduction in plant growth due to retarded cell division.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that SLE1 encodes the **OsCSLD4** protein, which was identified previously from a narrow leaf and dwarf 1 mutant.
   - Immunological studies and monosaccharide compositional and glycosyl linkage analyses explored several wall compositional effects caused by disruption of **OsCSLD4**, including alterations in the structure of arabinoxylan and the content of cellulose and homogalacturonan, which are distinct in the monocot grass species Oryza sativa (rice).
   - The **NRL1** mutation was rescued by transformation with the wild-type cellulose synthase-like D4 gene.
   - Accordingly, the cellulose synthase-like D4 gene was identified as the **NRL1** gene.
   - In addition to the size reduction of organs, **sle1** mutants exhibited serious developmental defects in pollen formation, anther dehiscence, stomata formation, and cell arrangement in various tissues.
   - **OsCD1** encodes a putative member of the cellulose synthase-like D sub-family and is essential for rice plant architecture and growth.
   - This study presents a detailed analysis of slender leaf 1 (**sle1**) mutants of rice that showed rolled and narrow leaf blades and a reduction in plant height.
   - The narrow leaf blade of **sle1** was caused by reduced cell proliferation beginning at the P3 primordial stage.
   - Map-based cloning indicates that a member of the cellulose synthase-like D (CSLD) group is a candidate for **OsCD1**.
   - Furthermore, sequence analysis indicates that **OsCD1** contains the common D,D,D,QXXRW motif, which is a feature of the cellulose synthase-like super-family.
   - **OsCSLD4** is mainly expressed in tissues undergoing rapid growth.
   - The inconsistent alterations in the two tissues and the observable structural defects in primary walls indicate that **OsCSLD4** plays important roles in cell-wall formation and plant growth.
   - **NRL1** was transcribed in various tissues and was mainly expressed in panicles and internodes.
   - Further study of **OsCSLD4** is expected to yield new insight into the role of hemicelluloses in plant development.
   - 08% phenotypic variation for plant height and leaf width, respectively, were located on the same interval of chromosome 12 flanking SSR markers RM519 and RM1103, and was named **DNL1** (Dwarf and Narrowed Leaf 1).
   - The results of ORF analysis in target region and nucleotide sequence alignment indicated that **DNL1** encodes cellulose synthase-like D4 protein, and a single nucleotide substitution (C2488T) in **DNL1** result in decrease in plant height and leaf width.
   - Intriguingly, the disruption of **OsCSLD4** function decreased grain width and weight, while overexpression of **OsCSLD4** increased grain width and weight.
   - Cellulose Synthase-Like Protein **OsCSLD4** Plays an Important Role in the Response of Rice to Salt Stress by Mediating ABA Biosynthesis to Regulate Osmotic Stress Tolerance.
   - This study demonstrated that the **OsCSLD4** function-disrupted mutant nd1 was sensitive to salt stress, but insensitive to ABA.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **OsCSLD4** can enhance rice ABA synthesis gene expression, increase ABA content, and improve rice salt tolerance, thus implying that **OsCSLD4**-regulated rice salt stress tolerance is mediated by ABA synthesis.
   - The results from the transcriptome analysis showed that more osmotic stress responsive genes were impaired in nd1 than salt stress responsive genes, thus indicating that **OsCSLD4** is involved in rice salt stress response through an ABA-induced osmotic response pathway.
   - Natural variation in **OsCD1** with a missense mutation Val449Asp is responsible for the divergence of rice grain Cd accumulation between indica and japonica.
   - Rice cellulose synthase-like protein **OsCSLD4** coordinates the trade-off between plant growth and defense..
   - Collectively, our data reveals the importance of **OsCSLD4** in balancing the trade-off between rice growth and defense.
   - Loss function of **OsCSLD4** leads to a constitutive activation of defense response in rice.
   - The **OsCSLD4** function-disrupted mutant displayed reduced SSAS tolerance, biomass and grain yield, whereas the **OsCSLD4** overexpression lines exhibited increased SSAS tolerance.
   - Collectively, this study not only reveals the potential role of cell wall matrix polysaccharides in mediating SSAS tolerance, but also highlights applicable value of **OsCSLD4** and the large-scale screening system in developing SSAS-tolerant rice.
