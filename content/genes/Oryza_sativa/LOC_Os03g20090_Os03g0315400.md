## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g20090](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g20090)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0315400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0315400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** Osmyb2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **Osmyb2**-overexpressing plants accumulated greater amounts of soluble sugars and proline than wild-type plants under salt stress.
   - Overexpression of **Osmyb2** enhanced up-regulation of genes encoding proline synthase and transporters.
   - This study isolated a rice R2R3-type MYB gene, **Osmyb2**, and functionally characterized its role in tolerance to abiotic stress by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpressing and RNA interference **Osmyb2**.
   - No difference in growth and development between the **Osmyb2**-overexpressing and wild-type plants was observed under normal growth conditions, but the **Osmyb2**-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt, cold, and dehydration stresses and more sensitive to abscisic acid than wild-type plants.
   - These findings suggest that **Osmyb2** encodes a stress-responsive MYB transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in tolerance of rice to salt, cold, and dehydration stress.
   - Expression of **Osmyb2** was up-regulated by salt, cold, and dehydration stress.
   - A R2R3-type MYB gene, **Osmyb2**, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice.
