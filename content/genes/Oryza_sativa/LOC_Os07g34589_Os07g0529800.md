- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **eIF-1** over-expressing lines showed improved growth under salt stress that was correlated with maintenance of photosynthetic activity and reduced Na(+) and Cl(-) accumulation in leaves.
   - In a search for novel molecular mechanisms involved in salt acclimation, transcript analyses revealed increased expression of a SUI-homologous translation initiation factor **eIF-1** in the salt-tolerant grass species Festuca rubra ssp.
   - To further examine the role of **eIF-1** in salt tolerance, transgenic rice plants were generated that over-express this factor under the control of the CaMV-35S promoter.
   - Our data suggest that **eIF-1** has a central function in salt-stress adaptation in rice by regulating ion accumulation and the intracellular redox status.
   - Upon analysis of the cell specificity of **eIF-1** transcription by in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR), predominant signals were detected in rice leaf mesophyll.
   - The SUI-homologous translation initiation factor **eIF-1** is involved in regulation of ion homeostasis in rice.
