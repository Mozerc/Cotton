## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g08810](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g08810)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0190000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0190000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsGGP
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - All plants except for KO mutants of **OsGGP** showed distinct peaks in foliar AsA concentrations during the growth, which were consistent with up-regulation of **OsGGP**, suggesting that **OsGGP** plays a pivotal role in regulating foliar AsA levels during different growth stages.
   - Mutants showed lower biomass production than their wild-types, especially when **OsGGP** was lacking (around 80Â % reductions).
   - Foliar ascorbate concentrations were significantly increased in 35S-**OsGGP** plants in the vegetative growth phase relative to NS, but significantly reduced at the reproductive growth phase and were associated with reduced **OsGGP** transcript levels.
