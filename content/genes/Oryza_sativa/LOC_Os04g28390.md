## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os04g28390](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g28390)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0352066](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0352066)  
- **Gene Symbol:** IRP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - RNA-seq results revealed that 84% of genes upregulated by **IRP1** peptide were also induced by a microbe-associated molecular pattern(MAMP) chitin, including 13 OsWRKY transcription factors, indicating that **IRP1** and chitin share a similar signaling pathway.
   - Rice plants overexpressing **IRP1** enhanced resistance to the virulent rice blast fungus.
   - Application of **IRP1** peptide to rice suspension cells triggered the expression of **IRP1** itself and the defense gene PAL1.
   - Here, we studied **IRP1** functions in rice immunity.
   - Collectively, our findings indicate that **IRP1** functions as a phytocyokine in rice immunity regulating MAPKs and OsWRKYs that could amplify chitin and other signaling pathways, and provide new insights into how MAMPs and phytocyokines cooperatively regulate rice immunity.
