- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0125800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0125800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsBBI1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsBBI1**-overexpressing plants showed higher levels of H(2)O(2) accumulation in cells and higher levels of phenolic compounds and cross-linking of proteins in cell walls at infection sites by M.
   - The cell walls were thicker in the **OsBBI1**-overexpressing plants and thinner in the mutant plants than in the WT plants.
   - Our results suggest that **OsBBI1** modulates broad-spectrum resistance to blast fungus by modifying cell wall defence responses.
   - Rice RING protein **OsBBI1** with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence.
   - The expression of **OsBBI1** was induced by rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, as well as chemical inducers, benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid.
   - This indicates that **OsBBI1** modulates broad-spectrum resistance against the blast fungus.
   - We report that a rice gene, **OsBBI1**, encoding a RING finger protein with E3 ligase activity, mediates broad-spectrum disease resistance.
   - The functional characterization of **OsBBI1** provides insight into the E3 ligase-mediated innate immunity, and a practical tool for constructing broad-spectrum resistance against the most destructive disease in rice.
