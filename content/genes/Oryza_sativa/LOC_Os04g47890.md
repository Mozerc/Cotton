## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **MOF1** mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs.
   - Taken together, our results reveal that **MOF1** plays an important role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet determinacy in rice.
   - We used map-based cloning to identify the **MOF1** locus and confirmed our identification by complementation and by generating new **MOF1** alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing.
   - **MOF1** encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect.
   - **MOF1** localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs) to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes.
   - Due to the increase in the number of floral organs and development of extra transformed palea/marginal region of the palea (mrp)-like organs, some **MFS2** spikelets had a tendency to produce two florets.
   - These defects implied that the **MFS2** mutation caused abnormal specification of palea identity and partial loss of spikelet determination.
   - The results indicate that **MFS2** acts as a repressor that regulates floral organ identities and spikelet meristem determinacy in rice by forming a repression complex with rice TPL/TPR proteins.
   - In the **MFS2** mutant, specification of palea identity was severely disturbed and showed degradation or transformation into a lemma-like organ, and the number of all floral organs was increased to varying degrees.
