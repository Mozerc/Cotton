## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and **RGA1**.
   - In the present study, we used root elongation inhibition assay, lamina inclination assay and coleoptile elongation analysis to demonstrated reduced sensitivity of **D1** mutant plants (caused by the null mutation of RGA) to 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL), which belongs to brassinosteroids and plays a wide variety of roles in plant growth and development.
   - In **D1** plants, cell death in response to ethylene and H(2)O(2) was nearly completely abolished, indicating that signaling through Galpha is essential.
   - Nine alleles of **D1** showed a severer phenotype whilst **D1**-4 exhibited a mild phenotype with respect to seed size and elongation pattern of internodes.
   - Because the **D1** mutant is classified as gibberellin-insensitive, we suggest that the GTP-binding protein might be associated with gibberellin signal transduction.
   - We identified a spontaneous rice mutant, Epi-**D1**, that shows a metastable dwarf phenotype.
   - The phenotype is mitotically and meiotically inheritable and corresponds to the metastable epigenetic silencing of the DWARF1 (**D1**) gene.
   - To identify novel BR-related genes in rice (Oryza sativa), we monitored the transcriptomic response of the brassinosteroid deficient1 (br**D1**) mutant, with a defective BR biosynthetic gene, to brassinolide treatment.
   - In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (**RGA1**) mutant d1.
   - Previous studies suggested that the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit known as D1/**RGA1** in rice is involved in a phytohormone gibberellin-mediated signaling pathway.
   - Indica group Swarna [**RGA1**(I), accession number HQ634688], its promoter and its transcript upregulation in response to abiotic stresses.
   - Rice heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (**RGA1**): in silico analysis of the gene and promoter and its upregulation under abiotic stress.
   - In this study, we report a **D1** genetic interactor Taihu Dwarf1 (TU**D1**) that encodes a functional U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase.
   - Histological observations showed that the dwarf phenotype of tu**D1** is mainly due to decreased cell proliferation and disorganized cell files in aerial organs.
   - Genetic, phenotypic, and physiological analyses have shown that tu**D1** is epistatic to **D1** and is less sensitive to BR treatment.
   - This supports the idea that a **D1**-mediated BR signaling pathway occurs in rice to affect plant growth and development.
   - The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase TU**D1** functions with a heterotrimeric G alpha subunit to regulate Brassinosteroid-mediated growth in rice.
   - We used rice dwarf1 (**D1**) mutants lacking a single-copy Galpha gene and addressed Galpha's role in disease resistance.
   - The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to **RGA1**.
   - The transcript profiling of **RGA1**(I) showed upregulation following NaCl, cold and drought stress.
   - Here, we describe a novel BR-induced rice gene BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATE**D1** (BU1), encoding a helix-loop-helix protein.
   - BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATE**D1**, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice.
   - The GA sensitivity of second leaf sheath elongation in **D1** was similar to that of the wild type in terms of dose responsiveness, but the response of internode elongation to GA was much lower in **D1**.
   - The **D1** mutant, which is deficient for the heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit (Galpha) gene of rice, shows dwarfism and sets small round seeds.
   - Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in **D1**-5.
   - To determine whether dwarfism in **D1** is due to a reduction in cell number or to shortened cell length, the cell number of the leaf sheath, the internode, the root and the lemma was compared between Nipponbare, a wild-type rice and **D1**-5, a **D1** allele derived from Nipponbare.
   - In addition, cell enlargement was found in roots and lemma of **D1**-5, although the organ length in **D1**-5 was shorter than that of wild-type rice.
   - Evidence also implicates **D1** in the action of a second phytohormone Brassinosteroid (BR) and its pathway.
   - Compared with the wild type, GA induction of alpha-amylase activity in aleurone cells of **D1** was greatly reduced.
   - However, in the presence of high GA concentrations, alpha-amylase induction occurred even in **D1**.
   - Furthermore, Os20ox expression was up-regulated, and the GA content was elevated in the stunted internodes of **D1**.
   - In addition, a double mutant between **D1** and another GA-signaling mutant, slr, revealed that SLR is epistatic to the **D1**, supporting that the Galpha protein is involved in GA signaling.
   - As brassinosteroid signaling was known to be partially impaired in **D1**s, the sensitivity to 24-epibrassinolide (24-epiBL) was compared among **D1** alleles in a T65 genetic background.
   - The dwarf1 (d1) mutant of rice has repressed expression of the Galpha subunit **RGA1** of heterotrimeric G protein.
   - **D1** mutants exhibited a highly reduced hypersensitive response to infection by an avirulent race of rice blast.
   - Expression of the constitutively active OsRac1, a small GTPase Rac of rice, in **D1** mutants restored SE-dependent defense signaling and resistance to rice blast.
   - Analysis of genes encoding proteins related to G protein signaling revealed that four small GTPase genes, two GTPase-activating protein genes, and one GDP dissociation inhibitor gene but not **RGA1** were differentially expressed in epidermal cells above adventitious roots, indicating that Galpha activity is regulated posttranscriptionally.
   - Previously, we reported that the rice dwarf mutant, **D1**, is defective in the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (Galpha).
   - Rice dwarf mutant**D1**, which is defective in the a subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, affects gibberellin signal transduction.
   - In the present study, gibberellin (GA) signaling in **D1** and the role of the Galpha protein in the GA-signaling pathway were investigated.
   - Transcriptional regulation was not generally affected in the **D1** mutant, indicating that altered gene expression is not sufficient to trigger cell death in the absence of Galpha.
   - Accordingly, it may be useful to incorporate **RGA1** mutation in breeding or biotechnological strategies for development of drought-resistant rice.
   - We studied physiological responses to progressive drought of the dwarf rice mutant, d1, in which the **RGA1** gene, which encodes the GTP-binding 伪-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, is non-functional.
   - We therefore propose **RGA1** as a regulator of photoavoidance and photoprotection mechanisms in rice and highlight the prospect of exploiting modulation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling to increase these characteristics and improve the yield of cereals in the event of abiotic stress.
   - We studied physiological mechanisms of photoavoidance and photoprotection of a dwarf rice mutant with erect leaves, d1, in which the **RGA1** gene, which encodes the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, is non-functional.
   - Taken together, we propose that **RGA1** is one of the regulators in salt response partially through ROS scavenging, which might be helpful in elucidating salt tolerant mechanisms of heterotrimeric G protein in rice.
   - The detection results of 15N-ammonium nitrate and an expression analysis of genes associated with nitrogen demonstrated that **LW5** serves an important role in nitrate uptake and transport.
   - **LW5** affects plant architecture and grain size by regulating nitrogen transfer.
   - The loss of **LW5** functioning leads to an increase in the rate of photosynthesis, vascular bundles, and chlorophyll content.
   - Map-based cloning and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing indicated that **LW5** affects both the plant architecture and yield.
   - Transcription factor network analysis revealed the importance of **RGA1** in nitrogen signaling with DEGs such as Nin-like, WRKY, NAC, bHLH families, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthetase, OsCIPK23 and urea transporter.
   - Sub-clustering of DEGs-associated PPI network revealed that **RGA1** regulates metabolism, stress and gene regulation among others.
   - In this work, we investigated the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in gm and drought tolerance in rice d1 mutants, which harbor a null mutation in the G<a6><c1> subunit gene, **RGA1**.
   - These results suggest that **RGA1** could alleviate the low-light stress-induced impairment of pollen tube elongation to increase spikelet fertility by promoting sucrose unloading in the pistil and improving the metabolism and allocation of energy.
   - **RGA1** alleviates low-light-repressed pollen tube elongation by improving the metabolism and allocation of sugars and energy..
