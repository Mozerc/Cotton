## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our findings suggest that **UGT85E1** plays an important role in mediating plant response to drought and oxidative stresses.
   - Rice Glycosyltransferase Gene **UGT85E1** Is Involved in Drought Stress Tolerance Through Enhancing Abscisic Acid Response.
   - **UGT85E1** gene is significantly upregulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
   - The overexpression of **UGT85E1** led to an enhanced tolerance in transgenic rice plants to drought stress, while the **UGT85E1** mutants of rice showed a more sensitive phenotype to drought stress.
   - Further studies indicated that **UGT85E1** overexpression induced ABA accumulation, stomatal closure, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, increased proline and sugar contents, and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress conditions.
   - Moreover, when **UGT85E1** was ectopically overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the transgenic plants showed increased tolerance to drought as well as in rice.
   - In this study, we reported the characterization of a putative glycosyltransferase gene **UGT85E1** in rice.
