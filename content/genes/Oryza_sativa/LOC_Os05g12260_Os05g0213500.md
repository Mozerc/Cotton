## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic rice plants expressing **OsPYL**/RCAR5, a PYL/RCAR orthologue of rice, were found to be hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination and early seedling growth.
   - A rice orthologue of the ABA receptor, **OsPYL**/RCAR5, is a positive regulator of the ABA signal transduction pathway in seed germination and early seedling growth.
   - The constitutive expression of **OsPYL**/RCAR5 in rice driven by the Zea mays ubiquitin promoter induced the expression of many stress-responsive genes even under normal growth conditions and resulted in improved drought and salt stress tolerance in rice.
   - A rice ABA signalling unit composed of **OsPYL**/RCAR5, OsPP2C30, SAPK2, and OREB1 for ABA-dependent gene regulation was further identified, via interaction assays and a transient gene expression assay.
   - This suggests that, although exogenous expression of **OsPYL**/RCAR5 is able to improve abiotic stress tolerance in rice, fine regulation of its expression will be required to avoid deleterious effects on agricultural traits.
   - **OsPYL**/RCARs thus are considered to be good candidate genes for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in crops.
   - This work demonstrates that the cytosolic ABA receptor **OsPYL**/RCAR5 in O.
   - Previous work identified **OsPYL**/RCARs as functional ABA receptors regulating ABA-dependent gene expression in Oryza sativa.
