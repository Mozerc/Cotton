## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results suggested that **ZFP177** might play crucial but differential roles in plant responses to various abiotic stresses.
   - Through microarray analysis, it was found that four genes (**ZFP177**, ZFP181, ZFP176, ZFP173), two genes (ZFP181 and ZFP176) and one gene (ZFP157) were significantly induced by cold, drought and H(2)O(2) treatments, respectively.
   - Overexpression of **ZFP177** in tobacco conferred tolerance of transgenic plants to both low and high temperature stresses, but increased sensitivity to salt and drought stresses.
   - Further expression analysis showed that **ZFP177** was responsive to both cold and heat stresses, but down-regulated by salt.
   - Expression analysis of rice A20/AN1-type zinc finger genes and characterization of **ZFP177** that contributes to temperature stress tolerance.
   - The subcellular localization assay indicated that **ZFP177** was localized in cytoplasm in tobacco leaf and root cells.
