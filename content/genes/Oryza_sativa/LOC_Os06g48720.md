## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsHMA2** was mainly expressed in the mature zone of the roots at the vegetative stage, but higher expression was also found in the nodes at the reproductive stage.
   - **OsHMA2** was localized at the pericycle of the roots and at the phloem of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in the nodes.
   - The translocation ratios of zinc (Zn) and Cd were clearly lower in all mutants than in the wild type, suggesting that **OsHMA2** is a major transporter of Zn and Cd from roots to shoots.
   - In silico search and preliminary analyses in yeast suggest **OsHMA2** as a good candidate for the control of Cd xylem loading in rice.
   - Heterologous expression of **OsHMA2** in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed influx transport activity for zinc as well as cadmium.
   - Taken together, **OsHMA2** in the nodes plays an important role in preferential distribution of zinc as well as cadmium through the phloem to the developing tissues.
   - The yeast expressing **OsHMA2** was able to reverse the growth defect in the presence of excess Zn.
   - These results suggest that **OsHMA2** plays a role in Zn and Cd loading to the xylem and participates in root-to-shoot translocation of these metals in rice.
   - Here we investigated the role of the Zn/Cd transporter **OsHMA2**.
   - The **OsHMA2** transporter is involved in root-to-shoot translocation of Zn and Cd in rice.
   - Mutations in rice (Oryza sativa) heavy metal ATPase 2 (**OsHMA2**) restrict the translocation of zinc and cadmium.
   - The expression of **OsHMA2** in rice was observed mainly in the roots where **OsHMA2** transcripts were abundant in vascular bundles.
   - Furthermore, Zn and Cd concentrations of **OsHMA2**-suppressed rice decreased in the leaves, while the Zn concentration increased in the roots compared with the wild type (WT).
   - Here, we report that rice (Oryza sativa) heavy metal ATPase2 (**OsHMA2**), a member of P-type ATPases, is involved in preferential delivery of zinc to the developing tissues in rice.
   - Preferential delivery of zinc to developing tissues in rice is mediated by P-type heavy metal ATPase **OsHMA2**.
   - Furthermore, the Cd concentration in the grains of **OsHMA2**-overexpressing rice as well as in OsSUT1-promoter **OsHMA2** rice decreased to about half that of the WT, although the other metal concentrations were the same as in the WT.
   - By comparing each allele in the **OsHMA2** protein structure and measuring the Cd translocation ratio, we identified the C-terminal region as essential for Cd translocation into shoots.
   - Effective reduction of cadmium accumulation in rice grain by expressing OsHMA3 under the control of **OsHMA2** promoter.
   - These results indicate that expression of OsHMA3 under the control of **OsHMA2** promoter can effectively reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain through sequestering more Cd into the vacuoles of various tissues.
   - The aim of this study is to manipulate both expression and tissue localization of OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter in the roots by expressing it under the control of **OsHMA2** promoter, which shows high expression in different organs including roots, nodes and shoots.
   - Analysis of Cadmium Root Retention for Two Contrasting Rice Accessions Suggests an Important Role for **OsHMA2**.
   - Interestingly, the relative transcript abundance of **OsHMA2**, a gene controlling root-to-shoot Cd/Zn translocation, was not influenced by Cd exposure in Capataz and progressively increased in Beirao with the external Cd concentration, suggesting that activity of the **OsHMA2** transporter may differentially limit root-to-shoot Cd/Zn translocation in Capataz and Beirao.
