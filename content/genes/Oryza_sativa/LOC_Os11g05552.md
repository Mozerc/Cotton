## Functional Descriptions:
   - The defective **OscpSRP54a** (LOC_Os11g05552) was responsible for the pale green leaf phenotype of the viable pale green leaf 14 (pgl14) mutant.
   - Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that both **OscpSRP54a** and OscpSRP54b were essential for normal chloroplast development by interacting with OscpSRP43 in rice.
   - **OscpSRP54a** and OscpSRP54b might play distinct roles in transporting different chloroplast proteins into thylakoids through cpSRP-mediated pathway.
   - Both **OscpSRP54a** and OscpSRP54b were constitutively expressed mainly in shoots and leaves at the vegetative growth stage.
   - Here, we isolated and characterized a thermosensitive yellow-green leaf mutant named **TSYL1** (thermosensitive yellow leaf 1) from an ethylmethylsulfone (EMS)-mutagenized pool of rice.
   - Furthermore, and chloroplast development-related genes was influenced in **TSYL1** at different temperatures.
   - The expression of **TSYL1** was induced by high temperature.
   - These results indicated that the **TSYL1** gene plays a key role in chlorophyll biosynthesis and is affected by temperature at the transcriptional level.
   - At the mature stage of the **TSYL1** mutant, the plant height, tiller number, number of spikelets per panicle and 1000 seed weight were decreased significantly compared to those of wild-type plants, but the seed setting rate and panicle length were not.
