- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Although there are two osmotin genes in rice, **OsOSM1** is the one mainly expressed in leaf sheath at the booting stage, coinciding with the critical stage of SB development in the field.
   - Overexpression of **OsOSM1** Enhances Resistance to Rice Sheath Blight.
   - In this study, we found that overexpression of the **OsOSM1** gene, encoding an osmotin protein belonging to the pathogenesis-related protein 5 family, is able to improve rice resistance to SB in field tests.
   - Overexpression of **OsOSM1** (**OsOSM1**ox) in susceptible variety Xudao 3 significantly increases resistance to SB in transgenic rice.
   - The **OsOSM1** mRNA levels in different transgenic lines are found to be positively correlated with their SB resistance levels.
   - Intriguingly, although extremely high levels of **OsOSM1** were detrimental to rice development, appropriately elevated levels of OsSOM1 were obtained that enhanced rice SB resistance without affecting rice development or grain yield.
   - Taken together, our results demonstrate that **OsOSM1** plays an important role in defense against rice SB disease and provides a new target for engineering resistance to SB.
   - **OsOSM1** is upregulated by jasmonic acid (JA); furthermore, JA-responsive marker genes are induced in **OsOSM1**ox lines.
