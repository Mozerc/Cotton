- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os11g0129700](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os11g0129700)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsWRI1a
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OsWRI1a** under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter severely retarded plant growth and development in rice.
   - Thus, ectopic expression of **OsWRI1a** in rice enhances oil biosynthesis, but also leads to abnormal plant growth and development.
   - Expressing the **OsWRI1a** gene under the control of the P1 promoter of Brittle2 (highly expressed in endosperm but low in leaves and roots) increased the oil content of both leaves and endosperms and upregulated the expression of several genes related to late glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis.
   - The subcellular localization of Arabidopsis protoplasts showed that **OsWRI1a** encoded a nuclear localized protein.
