## Functional Descriptions:
   - Low-temperature stress increased mRNA levels of **OsAsr1** in both vegetative and reproductive organs.
   - Recently, we focused on ASR (Abscisic acid, Stress and Ripening) gene expression analyses and observed increased **ASR5** transcript levels in roots and shoots in response to Al.
   - In situ analysis showed that **OsAsr1** transcript was preferentially accumulated in the leaf mesophyll tissues and parenchyma cells of the palea and lemma.
   - Since this protein is regulated not only by abscisic acid but also by GA(3), these results indicate that **ASR5** might be involved in plant growth in addition to stress in the basal regions of leaf sheaths.
   - Because it is well known that Al induces photosynthetic dysfunction, here we discuss the hypothesis that **ASR5** might be sequestered in the chloroplasts as an inactive transcription factor that could be released to the nucleus in response to Al to regulate genes related to photosynthesis.
   - A proteomic approach showed that **ASR5** silencing affected several proteins related to photosynthesis in RNAi rice shoots.
   - The rice **ASR5** protein: a putative role in the response to aluminum photosynthesis disturbance.
   - Taken together, we suggest that **OsAsr1** gene play an important role during temperature stress, and that this gene can be used for generating plants with enhanced cold tolerance.
   - The expression of both **OsAsr1** and OsASR3 was induced by drought stress, which is a major regulator of the expression of all ASR genes in rice.
   - Our data also showed that the overexpression of either **OsAsr1** or OsASR3 in transgenic rice plants increased their tolerance to drought and cold stress.
   - **ASR5** out of these six proteins was significantly regulated by GA(3) at the protein level but not at the mRNA level in the basal region of leaf sheaths.
   - Identification and characterization of a gibberellin-regulated protein, which is **ASR5**, in the basal region of rice leaf sheaths.
   - We suggest that the **ASR5** protein acts as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of different genes that collectively protect rice cells from Al-induced stress responses.
   - Ectopic expression of a cold-responsive **OsAsr1** cDNA gives enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic rice plants.
   - **OsAsr1** and OsASR3 are the most abundant and are found in most tissues; they are enriched in the leaves and roots, respectively.
   - , **OsAsr1** in leaves and OsASR3 in roots).
   - Coexpression analysis of **OsAsr1** and OsASR3 and a comparison of the cis-acting elements upstream of **OsAsr1** and OsASR3 suggested that their expression is regulated in common by abiotic stresses but differently regulated by hormone and sugar signals.
   - Furthermore, an **ASR5**-GFP fusion in rice protoplasts revealed for the first time a chloroplast localization of this protein.
   - This work describes the transcriptomic analysis by deep sequencing two libraries, comparing miRNA abundance from the roots of transgenic **ASR5** knockdown rice seedlings with that of the roots of wild-type non-transformed rice seedlings.
   - Overexpression of **OsASR2** enhanced the resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - These results suggest that the interaction between **OsASR2** and GT-1 plays an important role in the crosstalk of the response of rice to biotic and abiotic stresses.
   - Additionally, the expression of **OsASR2** was elevated by pathogens and osmotic stress challenges.
