## Functional Descriptions:
   - A novel blast-inducible RING-H2 type zinc finger protein gene **OsRING-1** was cloned from rice by cDNA library screening.
   - Tissue expression analysis showed that **OsRING-1** was constitutively strongly expressed in roots, but faintly in stems, leaves and sheaths.
   - The promoter sequence analysis of **OsRING-1** gene revealed that some ABA, GA, ethylene, wound, drought, heat stress and pathogen infection responsive elements were found within the **OsRING-1** promoter region.
   - Taken together, **OsRING-1**, as a novel C3H2C3-type zinc finger protein involved in many stress responses in rice might plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant stress response signal transduction pathways.
   - Northern analysis showed that **OsRING-1** was induced in different degree by pathogen infections, SA, ABA, JA and ethephon (ET) treatments.
   - In contrast, RNAi-mediated **OsATL38** knockdown transgenic progeny exhibited markedly increased tolerance to cold stress relative to that of wild-type plants, which indicated a negative role of **OsATL38** in response to cold stress.
   - **OsATL38** mediates mono-ubiquitination of the 14-3-3 protein OsGF14d and negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice.
   - These results suggested that the RING E3 Ub ligase **OsATL38** negatively regulates the cold stress response in rice via mono-ubiquitination of OsGF14d 14-3-3 protein.
   - In this study, **OsATL38** was identified as a low temperature-induced gene that encodes a rice homolog of Arabidopsis T<a8><ae>xicos en Levadura RING-type E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, which was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane.
