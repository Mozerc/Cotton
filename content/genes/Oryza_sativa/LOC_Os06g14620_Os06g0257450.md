## Functional Descriptions:
   - RNRL1 and **RNRS1** are highly expressed in the shoot base and in young leaves, and the expression of the genes that function in plastid transcription/translation and in photosynthesis is altered in v3 and st1 mutants, indicating that a threshold activity of RNR is required for chloroplast biogenesis in developing leaves.
   - The virescent3 (v3) and stripe1 (**St1**) mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) produce chlorotic leaves in a growth stage-dependent manner under field conditions.
   - Moreover, wild-type plants exposed to a low concentration of an RNR inhibitor, hydroxyurea, produce chlorotic leaves without growth retardation, reminiscent of v3 and **St1** mutants.
   - There were fewer chloroplasts and grana lamellas in **SDL** leaf compared with those of wild-type.
   - Additionally, the stripe leaf of **SDL** seedlings was highly sensitive to temperature, since the chlorophyll content was increased with the temperature rising.
   - The drooping leaf of **SDL** might be resulted from the disappearance of vascular bundles and mesophyll cells in both leaf midrib and lateral veins.
   - The mutant **SDL** exhibited development defects including stripe and drooping leaf, dwarfism and deformed floral organs.
   - The gene SDL was found allelic to **RNRS1** by map-based cloning, which was homologous to Arabidopsis TSO2 encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase.
   - Fittingly to the phenotypes of mutant **SDL**, the expression levels of genes associated with photosynthesis and chlorophyll synthesis were found to be down- or up-regulated at different temperatures in mutant **SDL**.
   - Also, the transcriptional levels of genes related to plant height and floral organ formation showed obvious differences between wild-type and **SDL**.
   - The redundant sequence was conserved in **SDL** homologous proteins, which contained the active site (tyrosine), as well as two amino acids glutamate and histidine involved in the binding of iron.
   - CONCLUSIONS: Our findings here suggest that **NSL2** function in the synthesis of dNTP, the deficient of which leads to DNA synthesis block and in turn affects cell cycle progression, and ultimately decreased cell number and narrow leaf in the **NSL2** plant.
   - The **NSL2** was expressed in variety of tissues, with the highest levels detected in leaves, and its protein was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
   - In addition, flow cytometric analysis and the altered transcript level of genes related to cell cycle indicated that **NSL2** affects cell cycle progression.
