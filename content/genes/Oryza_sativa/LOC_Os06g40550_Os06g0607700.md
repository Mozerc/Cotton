## Functional Descriptions:
   - Based on map-based cloning and sequence analysis, we identified a 1,459-bp deletion in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, **OsABCG15**, causing abnormal anthers and male sterility.
   - Consistently, histological analysis showed that **OsABCG15** mutants developed obvious abnormality in postmeiotic tapetum degeneration, leading to rapid degredation of young microspores.
   - Expression analysis showed that **OsABCG15** is expressed specifically in developmental anthers from stage 8 (meiosis II stage) to stage 10 (late microspore stage).
   - Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in **OsABCG15** mutant, suggesting that **OsABCG15** may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules.
   - The ATP-binding cassette transporter **OsABCG15** is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice.
   - The results suggest that **OsABCG15** plays a critical role in exine formation and pollen development, similar to the homologous gene of AtABCG26 in Arabidopsis.
   - **OsABCG15** encodes a membrane protein that plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation in rice..
   - An ABC transporter gene ( **OsABCG15** ) was proven to be involved in pollen development in rice.
   - This **OsABCG15** mutant failed to produce any viable pollen and was completely male sterile.
   - Histological analysis indicated that **OsABCG15** exhibited an undeveloped anther cuticle, enlarged middle layer, abnormal Ubisch body development, tapetum degeneration with a falling apart style, and collapsed pollen grains without detectable exine.
   - Our results suggested that **OsABCG15** played an essential role in the formation of the rice anther cuticle and pollen exine.
   - **OsABCG15** encodes a membrane protein that plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation in rice.
