## Functional Descriptions:
   - The spikelet identity gene **FZP**'' (frizzy panicle) is required for transformation of the floral meristems to inflorescent shoots.
   - In **FZP** mutants, spikelets are replaced by branches and spikelet meristems produce massive numbers of branch meristems.
   - Many **FZP** mutants drastically alter panicle morphology with higher-order rachis-branches developing successively instead of the development of floral organs in these mutants.
   - In addition, the AP2 family genes are important for determining the degree of ramification in branch meristems, regulating the spatio-temporal expression of spikelet meristem genes, such as FRIZZY PANICLE (**FZP**).
   - In the frizzy panicle (**FZP**) mutant of rice, the formation of florets is replaced by sequential rounds of branching.
   - The sequence analysis of **FZP**-9(t) revealed that there is a single nucleotide base change upstream of the ERF (ethylene-responsive element-binding factor) domain compare to wild-type plant.
   - Morphological and molecular characterization of a new frizzy panicle mutant, **FZP**-9(t), in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - The rice FRIZZY PANICLE (**FZP**) locus on chromosome 7, in which an ERF and acidic domain are present, is concerned with the regulation of spikelet meristem identity and the determination of panicle architecture.
   - The **FZP** mutant phenotype suggests that **FZP** is required to prevent the formation of axillary meristems within the spikelet meristem and permit the subsequent establishment of floral meristem identity.
   - A new mutant showing the same **FZP** phenotype was induced by γ-ray irradiation of seeds of a rice cultivar “Gimbozu.
   - In each of the normal panicle-bearing progeny plants, from occasional revertant seeds of the vegetatively-propagated mutant plant, Ds was shown to be excised from the **BFL1** locus.
   - Using a two-element Ac/Ds transposon tagging system we have isolated a rice mutant, designated branched floretless 1 (**BFL1**) which is defective in the transition from spikelet meristem to floret meristem.
   - RESULTS: The **BFL1** mutant shows normal differentiation of the primary rachis-branches leading to initial spikelet meristem (bract-like structure equivalent to rudimentary glumes) formation but fails to develop empty glumes and florets.
   - CONCLUSIONS: **BFL1** is a Ds-tagged rice mutant defective in the transition from spikelet meristem (SM) to floret meristem (FM).
   - **BFL1** contains an EREBP/AP2 domain and is most likely an ortholog of the maize transcription factor gene BRANCHED SILKLESS1 (BD1).
   - **BFL1** is most probably a rice ortholog of the maize ERF (EREBP/AP2) transcription factor gene BD1.
   - **FZP**-10 has several new characteristics, its altered nucleotide position and severity of phenotype alteration, and, therefore, could be a new gene resource to examine the function of **FZP** and the determination of rice panicle architecture.
   - A novel frameshift mutant allele, **FZP**-10, affecting the panicle architecture of rice.
   - Examination of this **FZP**-like mutant for its allelism to a known allele of **FZP**-1, nucleotide sequence, and panicle and agronomic characteristics clearly indicated that the allele of this **FZP**-like mutant is located in **FZP**.
   - The degree of higher-order branching in the panicles was significantly reduced in the **FZP**-10 mutant compared with that of **FZP**-1.
   - Moreover, the **FZP**-10 mutant showed highly depressed culm and panicle lengths and panicle number, as well as delayed heading dates compared with its wild type and also with **FZP**-1.
   - **FZP** encodes an ERF transcription factor and is the rice ortholog of the maize BD1 gene.
   - The **FZP**-9 (t) mutant showed retarded growth habit and developed fewer tillers than those of the wild- type plant.
   - We have isolated and characterized a new **FZP** mutant derived from anther culture lines in rice and designated as **FZP**-9 (t).
   - Based on the similarities in mutant phenotypes **BFL1** is likely to be an allele of the previously reported frizzy panicle locus.
   - Ds tagging of BRANCHED FLORETLESS 1 (**BFL1**) that mediates the transition from spikelet to floret meristem in rice (Oryza sativa L).
   - The primary and secondary rachis branches of **FZP**-9 (t) appeared to be normal, but higher-order branches formed continuous bract- like structures without developing spikelets.
   - Regulatory role of **FZP** in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.
   - However, the relationships among **FZP** and these floral identity genes in the regulation of panicle formation remain unclear.
   - The results indicate that **FZP** is a major negative regulator of RFL/APO2 and determines the transition from panicle branching to spikelet formation.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **FZP** severely represses axillary meristem formation in both the vegetative and reproductive phases and the outgrowth of secondary branches in panicle.
   - **FZP** overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM).
   - Thus, it suggested that **FZP** could specify floral organ identity by regulating the related OsMADS-box genes.
   - The CNV-18bp duplication repressed **FZP** expression, prolonged the panicle branching period and increased grain yield by more than 15% through substantially increasing the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) and slightly decreasing the 1,000-grain weight (TGW).
   - Duplication of an upstream silencer of **FZP** increases grain yield in rice.
   - These findings showed that the silencer CNVs coordinate a trade-off between SPP and TGW by fine-tuning **FZP** expression, and balancing the trade-off could enhance yield potential.
   - **SGDP7** is identical to FZP (FRIZZY PANICLE), which represses the formation of axillary meristems.
   - **FZP** determines grain size and sterile lemma fate in rice.
   - In the study, **FZP** encodes an ERF domain protein, and functions in grain size and sterile lemma identity.
   - Our results revealed that **FZP** plays a vital role in the regulation of grain size, and first provides clear evidence in support of the hypothesis that the lemma, rudimentary glume, and sterile lemma are homologous organs.
   - Interestingly, the sterile lemma underwent a homeotic transformation into a rudimentary glume in the **FZP**-12 and **FZP**-13 mutants, whereas the sterile lemma underwent a homeotic transformation into a lemma in **FZP** over-expressing plants, suggesting that **FZP** specifically determines the sterile lemma identity.
   - Mutation of **FZP** causes smaller grains and degenerated sterile lemmas.
   - Functional analyses showed that NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), a trypsin-like serine and cysteine protease, interacted with **FZP** and promoted **FZP** degradation.
   - Variation in **FZP** regulatory region causes increases of inflorescence secondary branches and grain yield in rice domestication.
   - 7-kb upstream of **FZP** may affect the binding activities of Auxin Response Factors (OsARFs) to the **FZP** promoter, decrease **FZP** expression level, and significantly enhance secondary branch number and grain yields in cultivated rice.
   - Consistently, down-regulating **FZP** expression or up-regulating NAL1 expression in commercial cultivar Zhonghua 17 increased secondary branches per panicle, grain number per panicle, and grain yield per plant.
   - Reduced expression of **FZP** in the reproductive stage increases the extent of higher order branching of the panicle, resulting in increased grain number.
   - These findings suggest that **PAA7** regulates the development of apical spikelets and interacts with LAX2 to regulate panicle development in rice.
   - Moreover, the severe damage for panicle phenotype in **PAA7**/lax2 double mutant indicated that **PAA7** could crosstalk with Lax Panicle 2 (LAX2).
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the 3 bp &quot;AGC&quot; insertion and 4 bp &quot;TCTC&quot; deletion mutation of **PAA7** were located in the 3&#x27;-UTR regions of LOC_Os07g47330, which was confirmed through complementary assays and overexpressed lines.
   - High accumulations of H(2)O(2) in **PAA7** caused programmed cell death (PCD) accompanied by nuclear DNA fragmentation in the apical spikelets.
