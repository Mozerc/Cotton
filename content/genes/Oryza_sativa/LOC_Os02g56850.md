## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of **OsGR2** and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with 150 mM NaCl.
   - In fact, exogenous application of ABA enhanced the expression of **OsGR2** and OsGR3 in rice roots.
   - On inhibiting ABA accumulation with sodium tungstate (Tu), an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, the expression of **OsGR2** and OsGR3 was still induced by NaCl; therefore, NaCl-triggered expression of **OsGR2** and OsGR3 in rice roots is not mediated by accumulation of ABA.
   - However, NaCl treatment could induce H2O2 production in rice roots, and H2O2 treatment resulted in enhanced **OsGR2** and OsGR3 induction.
   - Moreover, the increase in H2O2 level was prior to the induction of **OsGR2** and OsGR3 in NaCl-treated rice roots.
   - Thus, H2O2, but not ABA, is involved in regulation of **OsGR2** and OsGR3 expression in NaCl-treated rice roots.
   - mRNA and protein of **RGRC2** were observed mainly in roots and calli but little in leaf tissues.
   - From the presence of two ABA-responsive elements in the 5'-flanking region of **RGRC2**, we examined the expression in rice seedlings treated with ABA and the ABA-related environmental stresses, chilling, drought and salinity.
   - Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (**OsGR2**) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of GR identified in the rice genome.
   - Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (**OsGR2**) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and OsGR3) isoforms of glutathione reductase identified in the rice genome.
   - The expression of **OsGR2** and OsGR3 but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with NaCl.
   - NaCl-induced **OsGR2** and OsGR3 in rice roots could be associated with Na(+) but not an osmotic component.
