## Functional Descriptions:
   - To understand the functions of transcription factor **OsNAC5** in response to abiotic stress, we generated transgenic rice plants with knockdown **OsNAC5** by RNA-interfered (RNAi) and overexpressing **OsNAC5**, and investigated the effects of cold, drought and salt stress on wild-type (WT), RNAi and overexpression rice lines.
   - These findings highlight the important role of **OsNAC5** played in the tolerance of rice plants to abiotic stress by regulating downstream targets associated with accumulation of compatible solutes, Na(+) ions, H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde.
   - Physiological mechanisms underlying **OsNAC5**-dependent tolerance of rice plants to abiotic stress.
   - Both the RCc3:**OsNAC5** and GOS2:**OsNAC5** plants were found to have larger roots due to an enlarged stele and aerenchyma at flowering stage.
   - Field evaluations over three growing seasons revealed that the grain yield of the RCc3:**OsNAC5** and GOS2:**OsNAC5** plants were increased by 9%-23% and 9%-26% under normal conditions, respectively.
   - Under drought conditions, however, RCc3:**OsNAC5** plants showed a significantly higher grain yield of 22%-63%, whilst the GOS2:**OsNAC5** plants showed a reduced or similar yield to the nontransgenic (NT) controls.
   - Our present findings demonstrate that the root-specific overexpression of **OsNAC5** enlarges roots significantly and thereby enhances drought tolerance and grain yield under field conditions.
   - **OsNAC5** overexpression enlarges root diameter in rice plants leading to enhanced drought tolerance and increased grain yield in the field.
   - The root diameter was enlarged to a greater extent in the RCc3:**OsNAC5**, suggesting the importance of this phenotype for enhanced drought tolerance.
   - Of the genes specifically up-regulated in the RCc3:**OsNAC5** roots, GLP, PDX, MERI5 and O-methyltransferase were implicated in root growth and development.
   - Expression of **OsNAC5** is induced by abiotic stresses such as drought, cold, high salinity, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonic acid.
   - The abiotic stress-responsive NAC-type transcription factor **OsNAC5** regulates stress-inducible genes and stress tolerance in rice.
   - We show that **OsNAC5** expression is up-regulated by natural (aging) and induced senescence processes (dark, ABA application, high salinity, cold and Fe-deficiency) and its expression is not affected in the presence of 6-benzylaminopurine (a senescence inhibitor) under dark-induced senescence.
   - Using four different rice cultivars, we show that **OsNAC5** up-regulation is higher and earlier in flag leaves and panicles of IR75862 plants, which have higher seed concentrations of Fe, Zn and protein.
   - We suggest that **OsNAC5** is a novel senescence-associated ABA-dependent NAC transcription factor and its function could be related to Fe, Zn and amino acids remobilization from green tissues to seeds.
   - The transcription factor **OsNAC5** in rice is a member of the plant-specific NAC family that regulates stress responses.
   - **OsNAC5**-overexpressing transgenic plants also had improved tolerance to high salinity compared to control plants.
   - Salt induction of **OsNAC5** expression is abolished by nicotinamide, an inhibitor of ABA effects.
   - Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins **OsNAC5** and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different.
   - Furthermore, because **OsNAC5** overexpression did not retard growth, **OsNAC5** may be a useful gene that can improve the stress tolerance of rice without affecting its growth.
   - Differential expression of selected genes (encoding 7 transport proteins, the OsNAS3 enzyme and the **OsNAC5** transcription factor) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR.
   - Identification of up-regulated genes in flag leaves during rice grain filling and characterization of **OsNAC5**, a new ABA-dependent transcription factor.
   - In addition, knockdown and overexpression of **OsNAC5** enhanced and reduced accumulation of malondialdehyde and H(2)O(2), suggesting that knockdown of **OsNAC5** renders RNAi plants more susceptible to oxidative damage.
   - Here, we report the results of field evaluations of transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsNAC5**, under the control of either the root-specific (RCc3) or constitutive (GOS2) promoters.
   - Also identified were 19 and 18 up-regulated genes that are specific to the RCc3:**OsNAC5** and GOS2:**OsNAC5** roots, respectively.
   - Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) gene CINNAMOYL-CoA REDUCTASE 10 (OsCCR10) is directly activated by the **OsNAC5** transcription factor, which mediates drought tolerance through regulating lignin accumulation.
   - Aiming a better understanding of the role of **OsNAC5** in rice plants, we investigated a mutant line carrying a T-DNA insertion in the promoter of **OsNAC5**, which resulted in enhanced expression of the transcription factor.
   - Plants with **OsNAC5** enhanced expression were shorter at the seedling stage and had reduced yield at maturity.
   - Ionomic analysis of leaves and seeds from the **OsNAC5** enhanced expression line revealed lower Fe and Zn concentrations in leaves and higher Fe concentrations in seeds than in WT plants, further suggesting that **OsNAC5** may be involved in regulating the ionome in rice plants.
