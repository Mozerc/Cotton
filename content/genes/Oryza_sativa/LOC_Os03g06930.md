## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g06930](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g06930)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0165300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0165300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsBLH6
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Further analyses were performed for the OsMYB55/61 and **OsBLH6** TFs, the former being a TF in which the Arabidopsis ortholog is known to participate in lignin biosynthesis (AtMYB61) and the latter being one for which no previous involvement in cell wall formation has been reported even in Arabidopsis (BLH6).
   - Moreover, expression of a reporter gene driven by the OsCAD2 promoter was enhanced in rice calli when OsMYB55/61 or **OsBLH6** was transiently expressed, demonstrating that they function in secondary cell wall formation.
