## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g38210](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g38210)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0570000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0570000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** SPL11
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression analysis indicated that **SPL11** is induced in both incompatible and compatible rice-blast interactions.
   - The rice (Oryza sativa) E3 ligase SPOTTED LEAF11 (**SPL11**) negatively regulates programmed cell death and disease resistance.
   - The rice U-box/ARM E3 ubiquitin ligase **SPL11** negatively regulates programmed cell death (PCD) and disease resistance, and controls flowering time through interacting with the novel RNA/DNA binding KH domain protein SPIN1.
   - These results suggest that RBS1 is a new negative regulator of flowering time that itself is positively regulated by SPIN1 but negatively regulated by **SPL11** in rice.
   - SPIN1, a K homology domain protein negatively regulated and ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase **SPL11**, is involved in flowering time control in rice.
   - In vitro ubiquitination assay indicated that the **SPL11** protein possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is dependent on an intact U-box domain, suggesting a role of the ubiquitination system in the control of plant cell death and defense.
   - We found that spl2, spl7 and **SPL11** mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor.
   - We demonstrate here that **SPL11** also regulates flowering via interaction with SPIN1 (for **SPL11**-interacting protein1), a Signal Transduction and Activation of RNA family member.
   - **SPL11** mutants have delayed flowering under long-day conditions.
   - Our data are consistent with a model in which SPIN1 acts as a negative regulator of flowering that itself is negatively regulated by **SPL11**, possibly via ubiquitination.
   - The rice (Oryza sativa) spotted leaf11 (**SPL11**) mutant was identified from an ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized indica cultivar IR68 population and was previously shown to display a spontaneous cell death phenotype and enhanced resistance to rice fungal and bacterial pathogens.
