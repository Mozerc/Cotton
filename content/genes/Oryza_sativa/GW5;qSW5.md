## Functional Descriptions:
   - Together, our results suggest that **GW5** represents a major QTL underlying rice width and weight, and that it likely acts in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to regulate cell division during seed development.
   - We earlier identified a major QTL that controls rice grain width and weight, **GW5**, which was mapped to a recombination hotspot on rice chromosome 5.
   - To gain a better understanding of how **GW5** controls rice grain width, we conducted fine mapping of this locus and uncovered a 1 212-bp deletion associated with the increased grain width in the rice cultivar Asominori, in comparison with the slender grain rice IR24.
   - Isolation and initial characterization of **GW5**, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight.
   - Through fine mapping, complementation testing and association analysis, we found that a deletion in **qSW5** resulted in a significant increase in sink size owing to an increase in cell number in the outer glume of the rice flower; this trait might have been selected by ancient humans to increase yield of rice grains.
   - In addition, genotyping analyses of 46 rice cultivars revealed that this deletion is highly correlated with the grain-width phenotype, suggesting that the **GW5** deletion might have been selected during rice domestication.
   - This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling rice grain development and suggests that **GW5** could serve as a potential tool for high-yield breeding of crops.
   - Here we report the cloning of a newly identified QTL, **qSW5** (QTL for seed width on chromosome 5), involved in the determination of grain width in rice.
   - These analyses show that the **qSW5** deletion had an important historical role in artificial selection, propagation of cultivation and natural crossings in rice domestication, and shed light on how the rice genome was domesticated.
   - **GW5** protein is localized to the plasma membrane and can physically interact with and repress the kinase activity of rice GSK2 (glycogen synthase kinase 2), a homologue of Arabidopsis BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2) kinase, resulting in accumulation of unphosphorylated OsBZR1 (Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) and DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) proteins in the nucleus to mediate brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive gene expression and growth responses (including grain width and weight).
   - **GW5** acts in the brassinosteroid signalling pathway to regulate grain width and weight in rice.
   - We provide evidence that the 1,212-bp deletion affects grain width most likely through influencing the expression levels of **GW5**.
   - Our results suggest that **GW5** is a novel positive regulator of BR signalling and a viable target for genetic manipulation to improve grain yield in rice and perhaps in other cereal crops as well.
