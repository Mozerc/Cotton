## Functional Descriptions:
   - Suppression of endogenous **OsLIC** expression resulted in drastically increased leaf and tiller angles, shortened shoot height, and consequently reduced grain production in rice.
   - Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (**LIC**) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway.
   - **OsLIC**, a Novel CCCH-Type Zinc Finger Protein with Transcription Activation, Mediates Rice Architecture via Brassinosteroids Signaling.
   - Quantitative PCR revealed **LIC** transcription rapidly induced by BR treatment.
   - Image analysis and immunoblotting showed that upon BR treatment **LIC** proteins translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent fashion.
   - Molecular and physiology assays revealed that **LIC** plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels.
   - Here we describe a novel CCCH-type zinc finger gene, **OsLIC** (Oraza sativaleaf and tiller angle increased controller), which is involved in the regulation of rice plant architecture.
   - **OsLIC** may be a transcription activator to control rice plant architecture.
   - **OsLIC** is predominantly expressed in rice collar and tiller bud.
   - The gain-of-function mutant **LIC**-1 and **LIC**-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of **LIC** and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending.
   - **LIC** directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1.
   - Thus, **LIC** regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1.
   - Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator **LIC** in rice.
   - The phenotypes of **LIC**-1 and **LIC**-overexpressing lines in erect leaves contribute to ideal plant architecture.
   - OsRELA Regulates Leaf Inclination by Repressing the Transcriptional Activity of **OsLIC** in Rice.
   - Therefore, our results suggest that OsRELA can act as a transcriptional regulator and is involved in the regulation of leaf inclination by regulating the transcriptional activity of **OsLIC**.
   - OsMAPK6 phosphorylates a zinc finger protein **OsLIC** to promote downstream OsWRKY30 for rice resistance to bacterial blight and leaf streak.
   - Rice **OsLIC** encoding a CCCH zinc finger transcription factor plays an important role in immunity.
   - Genetic assays confirmed that the osilc knockout mutants and OsWRKY30-overexpressing plants exhibited enhanced resistance to Xoo and Xoc, knocking out OsWRKY30 in the **OsLIC** mutants attenuated the resistance against bacterial pathogens.
   - OsMAPK6 physically interacted with and phosphorylated **OsLIC** leading to decreased **OsLIC** DNA-binding activity, therefore, overexpression of **OsLIC** partially suppressed OsMAPK6-mediated rice resistance.
   - Collectively, these results reveal that OsMAPK6-mediated phosphorylation of **OsLIC** positively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and Xoc by modulating OsWRKY30 transcription, suggesting that OsMAPK6-**OsLIC**-OsWRKY30 module is an immune signaling pathway in response to the bacterial pathogens.
