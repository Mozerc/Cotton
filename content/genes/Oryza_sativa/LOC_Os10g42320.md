## Functional Descriptions:
   - These expression profiles suggested that overexpression of **OsNMD3**(deltaNLS) affected ribosome biogenesis and certain basic pathways, leading to pleiotropic abnormalities in plant growth.
   - Analyses of the transactivation activity and cellulose biosynthesis level revealed low protein synthesis efficiency in the transgenic plants compared with the wild-type plants.
   - A dominant negative form of **OsNMD3** with a truncated nuclear localization sequence (**OsNMD3**(deltaNLS)) was retained in the cytoplasm, consequently interfering with the release of **OsNMD3** from pre-60S particles and disturbing the assembly of ribosome subunits.
   - Moreover, global expression profiles of the wild-type and transgenic plants were investigated using the Illumina RNA sequencing approach.
   - Retention of **OsNMD3** in the cytoplasm disturbs protein synthesis efficiency and affects plant development in rice.
   - sativa NMD3 (**OsNMD3**) shares all the common motifs and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm via CRM1/XPO1.
   - This study chose a highly conserved trans-factor, the 60S ribosomal subunit nuclear export adaptor NMD3, to characterize the mechanism of ribosome biogenesis in the monocot plant Oryza sativa (rice).
