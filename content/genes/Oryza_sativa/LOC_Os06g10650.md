- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Taken together with gene function annotation and expression profiles, it indicates that **ORF1** (LOC_Os06g10650), encoding a tyrosine phosphatase family protein might be the causal candidate gene for seed germination under salt stress in the qGR6.2 locus.
   - As reported previously, PTP family proteins have been reported to regulate signal transduction and control plant growth and development [33], and the PHD finger has been identified as one of the major families of histone reader domains, being involved in recognition of methylated H3K4 [34], so we speculated **ORF1** (LOC_Os06g10650) and ORF5 (LOC_Os06g10690) might play similar functions in rice.
