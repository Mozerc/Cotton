- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0140100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0140100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsMYB2P-1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, primary roots of **OsMYB2P-1**-overexpressing plants were shorter than those in wild-type plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, while primary roots and adventitious roots of **OsMYB2P-1**-overexpressing plants were longer than those of wild-type plants under Pi-deficient conditions.
   - These results suggest that **OsMYB2P-1** may also be associated with the regulation of root system architecture.
   - **OsMYB2P-1**, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice.
   - An R2R3 MYB transcription factor, **OsMYB2P-1**, was identified from microarray data by monitoring the expression profile of rice (Oryza sativa ssp.
   - Moreover, expression of OsPT2, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in **OsMYB2P-1**-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of **OsMYB2P-1** under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that **OsMYB2P-1** may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters.
   - Expression of **OsMYB2P-1** was induced by Pi starvation.
   - Overexpression of **OsMYB2P-1** in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, while suppression of **OsMYB2P-1** by RNA interference in rice rendered the transgenic rice more sensitive to Pi deficiency.
   - These findings demonstrate that **OsMYB2P-1** is a novel R2R3 MYB transcriptional factor associated with Pi starvation signaling in rice.
