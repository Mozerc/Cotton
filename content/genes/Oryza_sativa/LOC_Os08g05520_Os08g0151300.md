## Functional Descriptions:
   - "**OsMYB103L**, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, influences leaf rolling and mechanical strength in rice (Oryza sativa L.).".
   - Leaf rolling is one of the important traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - Overexpression of **OsMYB103L** in rice resulted in a rolled leaf phenotype.
   - These findings suggest that **OsMYB103L** may target CESA genes for regulation of cellulose synthesis and could potentially be engineered for desirable leaf shape and mechanical strength in rice.
   - "MYB transcription factors are one of the largest gene families and have important roles in plant development, metabolism and stress responses".
   - "In this study, we report the functional characterization of a rice gene, **OsMYB103L**, which encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor".
   - "Further analyses showed that expression levels of several cellulose synthase genes (CESAs) were significantly increased, as was the cellulose content in **OsMYB103L** overexpressing lines".
   - Knockdown of **OsMYB103L** by RNA interference led to a decreased level of cellulose content and reduced mechanical strength in leaves.
   - ) breeding.
   - "**OsMYB103L** may also function as a master switch to regulate the expression of several downstream TFs, which involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis".
   - "Our findings revealed that **OsMYB103L** plays an important role in GA-regulating secondary cell wall synthesis, and the manipulation of this gene provide a new strategy to help the straw decay in soil".
   - "Furthermore, **OsMYB103L** physically interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor of GA signaling, and involved in GA-mediated regulation of cellulose synthesis pathway".
   - "**OsMYB103L** mediates cellulose biosynthesis and secondary walls formation mainly through directly binding the CESA4, CESA7, CESA9 and BC1 promoters and regulating their expression".
   - Biochemical assays demonstrated that **OsMYB103L** is a nuclear protein and shows high transcriptional activation activity at C-terminus.
