## Functional Descriptions:
   - The loss of **Pho1** caused smaller starch granules to accumulate and modified the amylopectin structure.
   - These results strongly suggest that **Pho1** plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of **Pho1** at high temperatures.
   - The phenotype of the **Pho1** mutation was temperature dependent.
   - Plastidial phosphorylase (**Pho1**) accounts for approximately 96% of the total phosphorylase activity in developing rice (Oryza sativa) seeds.
   - Variation in the morphological and biochemical phenotype of individual seeds was common to all 15 **Pho1**-independent homozygous mutant lines studied, indicating that this phenotype was caused solely by the genetic defect.
   - Our work suggests that regulation of **Pho1** expression via its uORF might be a genetic resource useful-both in natural populations and in the context of genome editing-toward improving plant growth under Pi-deficient conditions.
   - We further show that natural accessions lacking the **Pho1** uORF exhibit higher **Pho1** protein levels and shoot Pi content.
   - Increased shoot Pi content was linked to the absence of the **Pho1** uORF in a population of F2 segregants.
   - In this work, we demonstrate that an upstream open reading frame (uORF) present in the 5' untranslated region of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) **Pho1** inhibits its translation and influences Pi homeostasis.
   - A point mutation removing the **Pho1** uORF (<a6><a4>uORF) in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in increased association of its mRNA with polysomes and led to higher **Pho1** protein levels, independent of Pi availability.
   - **Pho1** deficiency impaired MOS mobilization, triggering short MOS accumulation and starch synthesis reduction during early seed development.
   - **Pho1** cooperates with DPE1 to control short maltooligosaccharide mobilization during starch synthesis initiation in rice endosperm.
   - These findings show that **Pho1** cooperates with DPE1 to control short MOS mobilization during starch synthesis initiation in rice endosperm.
