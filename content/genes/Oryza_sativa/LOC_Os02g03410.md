## Functional Descriptions:
   - A significant number of genes involved in lipid metabolism and protection against oxidative stress appear to be up-regulated by **OsCPK4** in roots of overexpressor plants.
   - Taken together, our data show that **OsCPK4** functions as a positive regulator of the salt and drought stress responses in rice via the protection of cellular membranes from stress-induced oxidative damage.
   - Meanwhile, **OsCPK4** overexpression has no effect on the expression of well-characterized abiotic stress-associated transcriptional regulatory networks (i.
   - Overexpression of **OsCPK4** in rice plants significantly enhances tolerance to salt and drought stress.
   - Compared with control plants, **OsCPK4** overexpressor plants exhibit stronger water-holding capability and reduced levels of membrane lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage under drought or salt stress conditions.
   - Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of **OsCPK4** was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged **OsCPK4** in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells.
   - Here, we report that **OsCPK4** expression is induced by high salinity, drought, and the phytohormone abscisic acid.
   - Also, salt-treated **OsCPK4** seedlings accumulate less Na(+) in their roots.
   - Enhancing blast disease resistance by overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase **OsCPK4** in rice.
   - It shows that overexpression of **OsCPK4** gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration.
   - Altogether, our findings indicate that **OsCPK4** is a potential molecular target to improve not only abiotic stress tolerance, but also blast disease resistance of rice crops.
   - Given that **OsCPK4** overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice, the results reported in this article demonstrate that **OsCPK4** acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways.
   - **OsCPK4** overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield.
   - In this work, the isoform **OsCPK4** of the rice calcium-dependent protein kinase family is reported as a regulator of rice immunity to blast fungal infection.
   - The constitutive accumulation of **OsCPK4** protein prepares rice plants for a rapid and potentiated defence response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and defence gene expression.
   - The calcium-dependent protein kinase **OsCPK4** has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth and development in rice.
   - In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) were significantly enhanced in the **OsCPK4** mutants.
   - These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that **OsCPK4** negatively regulates innate immunity in rice.
   - However, little is known on molecular mechanisms underlying **OsCPK4** function in rice immunity.
   - These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive **OsCPK4** promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses; whereas the activation of **OsCPK4**-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery and thus enhancing plant immunity.
   - The kinase **OsCPK4** regulates a buffering mechanism that fine-tunes innate immunity.
   - **OsCPK4** was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176.
   - Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of **OsCPK4** and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176.
