- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0521300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0521300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsBON1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The defense activation in **OsBON1** knockdown mutants was associated with reduced growth, both of which were largely suppressed under high temperature.
   - In contrast, overexpression of **OsBON1** or OsBON3 decreased disease resistance and promoted plant growth.
   - Knockdown of **OsBON1** and dominant negative mutant of OsBON3 enhanced resistance to rice bacterial and fungal pathogens with either hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic life styles.
   - Rice copine genes **OsBON1** and OsBON3 function as suppressors of broad-spectrum disease resistance.
   - However, neither **OsBON1** nor OsBON3 could rescue the dwarf phenotype of the Arabidopsis BON1 knockout mutant, suggesting an evolutionary divergence of the rice and Arabidopsis copine genes.
   - Both **OsBON1** and OsBON3 changed their protein subcellular localization upon pathogen challenge.
   - Here, we show that the rice copine genes **OsBON1** and OsBON3 are critical suppressors of immunity.
