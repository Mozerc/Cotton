## Functional Descriptions:
   - This study has shown that **amy1** and amy2 from both wheat and barley have similar genomic properties, including exon/intron structures and GA-responsive elements on promoters, but these differ in rice.
   - As the extent of the decrease in chalky grains was highly correlated to decreases in the expression of Amy1A, **Amy1C**, Amy3A and Amy3B, these genes would be involved in the chalkiness through degradation of starch accumulating in the developing grains.
   - Although most α-amylase genes were down-regulated simultaneously in the transgenic plants, the extent of reduction in the expression of Amy1A, **Amy1C**, Amy3A and Amy3B was highly correlated to the degree of reduction in occurrence of chalky grains, suggesting a contribution of these isoforms to grain chalkiness.
