## Functional Descriptions:
   - Starch synthase IIa (**SSIIa**) is a major candidate gene for starch quality variation.
   - To search for the variation in **SSIIa** that is responsible for starch quality variation in rice, we sequenced the **SSIIa** exon 8 region and measured starch quality as starch disintegration in alkali for 289 accessions of cultivated rice and 57 accessions of its wild ancestor, Oryza rufipogon.
   - Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, Os**SSIIa**, SBE1, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression.
   - Variation in **SSIIa** enzyme activity is associated with the cohesiveness of rice grains when cooked, and our findings are consistent with selection for more cohesive grains during the domestication of tropical japonica rice.
   - To study the potential functional interactions of SS genes, we generated **SSIIa**/SSIIIa double repression lines whose kernels displayed a chalky kernel appearance and had increased amylose levels, increased pasting temperatures, and decreased viscosities.
   - The nonadditive nature of the double mutation line suggests that **SSIIa** and SSIIIa interact with each other during starch synthesis.
   - Collectively, the data showed that **SSIIa** and SSIIIa play distinctive, but partially overlapping, roles during rice grain starch synthesis.
   - Double repression of soluble starch synthase genes **SSIIa** and SSIIIa in rice (Oryza sativa L.) uncovers interactive effects on the physicochemical properties of starch.
   - Consistent with their expression domains, RNAi repression of genes that encode isozymes SSI, **SSIIa**, and SSIIIa had strong effects on grain development, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in transgenic plants with the other SS genes being RNAi repressed, indicating functional redundancies among the genes.
   - Previous map-based cloning revealed that GT was controlled by **ALK** gene, which encodes a putative soluble starch synthase II-3.
   - **ALK**, the key gene for gelatinization temperature, is a modifier gene for gel consistency in rice.
   - ALK encoding soluble starch synthase IIa (**SSIIa**) is the major gene determining grain GT in rice.
   - Genomic Regions Involved in Differences in Eating and Cooking Quality Other than Wx and **ALK** Genes between indica and japonica Rice Cultivars.
