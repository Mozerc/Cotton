- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0560500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0560500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsBISCPL1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **OsBISCPL1** in leaves was significantly up-regulated after treatments with benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and also up-regulated in incompatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea.
   - Furthermore, the **OsBISCPL1**-overexpressing plants also showed an increased tolerance to oxidative stress and up-regulated expression of oxidative stress-related genes.
   - The results suggest that the **OsBISCPL1** may be involved in regulation of defense responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress.
   - A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene **OsBISCPL1** is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress.
   - **OsBISCPL1** is expressed ubiquitously in rice, including roots, stems, leaves and spikes.
   - Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with constitutive expression of **OsBISCPL1** were generated and disease resistance assays indicated that the **OsBISCPL1**-overexpressing plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv.
