- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0840900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0840900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DVB1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Map-based cloning, genetic complementation, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that **DVB1** encodes a structural protein classified in the Mic10 family and is required for the formation of cristae in mitochondria, and was primarily expressed in vascular bundles.
   - Comparing with the wild type, disruption of amino acid metabolism and increased auxin synthesis were observed in **DVB1** mutant which also showed increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors.
   - Further studies indicated that **DVB1** is important for mitochondrial and plant development in rice.
   - The **DVB1** protein is partially localized in the mitochondria and capable of forming dimers and polymers.
   - CONCLUSIONS: **DVB1** belongs to Mic10 family and **DVB1** is partially localized in the mitochondria.
