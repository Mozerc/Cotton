## Functional Descriptions:
   - Previously, **qLTG3-1**, a major quantitative trait locus controlling low-temperature tolerance at the germination stage in rice (called low-temperature germinability) was identified, which encodes a protein of unknown function.
   - In particular, genes involved in defense responses were up-regulated by **qLTG3-1**, indicating that **qLTG3-1** expression is required for the expression of defense response genes in low-temperature germinability in rice.
   - Genome-wide analysis of genes targeted by **qLTG3-1** controlling low-temperature germinability in rice.
   - Most of these genes might be involved in the process of seed germination itself, and then a focus was made on **qLTG3-1** dependently induced or suppressed genes, defined as '**qLTG3-1** dependent' genes.
   - Twenty-nine '**qLTG3-1** dependent' genes with diverse functions were categorized, implying that disruption of cellular homeostasis leads to a wide range of metabolic alterations and diverse cross-talk between various signaling pathways.
   - The QTL **qLTG3-1** is strongly expressed in the embryo during seed germination.
   - To understand the molecular basis of one of these QTLs, **qLTG3-1** (quantitative trait locus for low-temperature germinability on chromosome 3), map-based cloning was performed, and this QTL was shown to be encoded by a protein of unknown function.
   - Molecular identification of a major quantitative trait locus, **qLTG3-1**, controlling low-temperature germinability in rice.
   - rufipogon **qLTG3-1** allele can be utilized for the improvement of LTG in rice breeding programs.
