## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and **OsBIERF4** was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice.
   - We isolated and identified four rice genes, OsBIERF1 to **OsBIERF4** (Oryza sativa benzothiadiazole (BTH)-induced ethylene responsive transcriptional factors (ERF)) and analyzed their expressions in rice disease resistance response and under various abiotic stress conditions.
   - In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and **OsBIERF4** was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings.
   - Moreover, OsBIERF1, OsBIERF3 and **OsBIERF4** were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding.
