## Functional Descriptions:
   - **BLS1** is expressed strongly in young inflorescence, specifically the young lemmas and paleas of spikelets.
   - In **BLS1** mutant, floral-organ identity and floral-organ patterning are normal, and the defects occur at the stage of the lemma and palea expansion, whereas the other aspects of floral architecture and form are not affected.
   - Here, we isolated a rice mutant, beak-shaped grain1 (**BSG1**), which produced beak-shaped grains of decreased width, thickness and weight with a loosely interlocked lemma and palea that were unable to close tightly.
   - Consistent with the lemma and palea shapes, the outer parenchyma cell layers of these **BSG1** tissues developed fewer cells with decreased size.
   - Our results suggest that **BSG1** determines grain shape and size probably by modifying cell division and expansion in the grain hull.
   - The **BSG1** mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice.
   - Starch granules were also irregularly packaged in the **BSG1** grains.
   - In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, beak like spikelet1 (**BLS1**), which specifically affects development of the lemma and palea.
   - Our study suggested that **BLS1** is required for lateral development of the lemma and palea and does not function at stages of floral-organ initiation and patterning.
   - Quantitative PCR and GUS fusion reporter assays showed that **BSG1** was expressed mainly in the young panicle and elongating stem.
   - Expression of the AP1-like and SEP-like floral homeotic genes were not changed in the **BLS1** mutant.
   - Detailed morphological analysis indicated that the **TH1** mutation caused a reduction in the size of tubercles, which are convex structures on the surface of the lemma and palea.
   - Thus, the **TH1** gene seems to be involved in fine-tuning the morphogenesis of the lemma and palea.
   - By contrast, the number of tubercle rows and their spatial distribution on the lemma were not affected in the **TH1** mutant.
   - In situ hybridization analysis revealed that **TH1** was highly expressed in the primordia of the lemma and palea, but only weakly expressed in the primordia of the sterile lemma and rudimentary glume.
   - The result showed that the **TH1** mutation strongly affected the morphology of the extra lemma of eg1, but had no significant effect on the transformed lemma of g1.
   - We then examined the effect of **TH1** mutation on the lemma-like structure formed in the long sterile lemma/glume1 (g1) and extra glume1 (eg1) mutants.
   - The **AFD1** mutant showed variable defects including the dwarfism, long panicle, low seed setting and reduced grain yield.
   - Meantime, our results suggested that **AFD1** regulated the expression of cell division and expansion related genes.
   - In addition, abnormal floral organs were also observed in the **AFD1** mutant including slender and thick hulls, and hull-like lodicules.
   - These results indicate that **TH1** functions as a transcription repressor and regulates cell expansion during the lateral development of spikelet.
   - **TH1** has been shown to regulate the lateral development of spikelet, but its mode of action remains unclear.
   - The **TH1** protein was shown to localize in the nucleus and possess transcriptional repression activity.
