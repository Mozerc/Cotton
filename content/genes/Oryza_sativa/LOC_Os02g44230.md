## Functional Descriptions:
   - Application of exogenous ABA (50 microM) resulted in a transient increase of **OsTPP1** expression within 20 min of the treatment, thereby suggesting involvement of ABA in **OsTPP1** gene regulation.
   - Expression analysis demonstrated that **OsTPP1** was initially and transiently up-regulated after salt, osmotic and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments but slowly up-regulated under cold stress.
   - **OsTPP1** overexpression in rice enhanced tolerance to salt and cold stress.
   - Northern blots revealed that the **OsTPP1** transcript levels were fairly low or under detectable limits in most of the tissues under ambient conditions but were highly induced within 1-2 h of chilling stress (12 degrees C) in both root and shoot tissues of seedlings.
   - Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as OsLEA3, **OsTPP1**, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines.
   - Transient expression of **OsTPP1** was also induced under severe chilling stress (4 degrees C) as well as salinity and drought stresses at ambient temperatures.
   - Here we report that **OsTPP1** and OsTPP2 are the two major trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase genes expressed in vegetative tissues of rice.
   - Analysis of the overexpression lines revealed that **OsTPP1** triggered abiotic stress response genes, which suggests a possible transcriptional regulation pathway in stress induced reprogramming initiated by **OsTPP1**.
   - The current study revealed the mechanism of an OsTPP gene involved in stress tolerance in rice and also suggested the use of **OsTPP1** in abiotic stress engineering of crops.
   - Under chilling stress, active OsMAPK3 phosphorylates OsbHLH002, leading to accumulation of phospho-OsbHLH002, which promotes **OsTPP1** expression and increases trehalose content and resistance to chilling damage.
   - <U+00A0>Taken together, these results indicate that OsbHLH002 is phosphorylated by OsMAPK3, which enhances OsbHLH002 activation to its target **OsTPP1** during chilling stress.
   - OsMAPK3 Phosphorylates OsbHLH002/OsICE1 and Inhibits Its Ubiquitination to Activate **OsTPP1** and Enhances Rice Chilling Tolerance.
   - **OsTPP1** regulates seed germination through the crosstalk with abscisic acid in rice.
   - <U+2022> In this study, roles of **OsTPP1** on seed germination in rice were investigated.
   - In addition, ABA responsive genes, especially OsABI5, were invoved in **OsTPP1** mediated seed germination.
   - <U+2022> Overall, our study provided new pathways in seed germination that **OsTPP1** controlled seed germination through the crosstalk with ABA catabolism pathway.
   - Furthermore, two of ABA catabolism genes were downregulated in tpp1 mutant which were responsible for increased ABA levels, and exogenous trehalose increased transcripts of ABA catabolism genes, suggesting that **OsTPP1** and ABA catabolism genes acted in the same signaling pathway.
