## Functional Descriptions:
   - Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of **OsSK1** and OsSK2 was induced in rice calli by treatment with the elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose, and that expression of **OsSK1** and OsSK3 was up-regulated specifically during the heading stage of panicle development.
