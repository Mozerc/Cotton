## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we report that a rice nuclear factor, RICE SALT SENSITIVE3 (**RSS3**), regulates root cell elongation during adaptation to salinity.
   - **RSS3** is preferentially expressed in the root tip and forms a ternary complex with class-C basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN proteins, the latter of which are the key regulators of jasmonate (JA) signaling.
   - Loss of function of **RSS3** only moderately inhibits cell elongation under normal conditions, but it provokes spontaneous root cell swelling, accompanied by severe root growth inhibition, under saline conditions.
   - These results, together with the known roles of JAs in root growth regulation, suggest that **RSS3** modulates the expression of JA-responsive genes and plays a crucial role in a mechanism that sustains root cell elongation at appropriate rates under stressful conditions.
