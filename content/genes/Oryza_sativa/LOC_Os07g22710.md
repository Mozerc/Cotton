## Functional Descriptions:
   - We previously reported that rice CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 18 (**OsCPK18**) and MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 5 (OsMPK5) mutually phosphorylate each other and that **OsCPK18** phosphorylates and positively regulates OsMPK5 to suppress rice immunity.
   - In vitro and inâ€‰vivo kinase assays demonstrated that OsMPK5 phosphorylates C-terminal threonine (T505) and serine (S512) residues of **OsCPK18** and OsCPK4, respectively.
   - The kinase activity of **OsCPK18**(T505D) , in which T505 was replaced by aspartic acid to mimic T505 phosphorylation, displayed less calcium sensitivity than that of wild-type **OsCPK18**.
   - Interestingly, editing the MAPK phosphorylation motif in **OsCPK18** and its paralog OsCPK4, which deprives OsMPK5-mediated phosphorylation but retains calcium-dependent activation of kinase activity, simultaneously increases rice yields and immunity.
   - In this study, we found that **OsCPK18** and its paralog OsCPK4 positively regulate plant height and yield-related traits.
