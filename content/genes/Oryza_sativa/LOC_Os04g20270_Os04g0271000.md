## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsSRT1** RNA interference induced an increase of histone H3K9 (lysine-9 of H3) acetylation and a decrease of H3K9 dimethylation, leading to H(2)O(2) production, DNA fragmentation, cell death, and lesions mimicking plant hypersensitive responses during incompatible interactions with pathogens, whereas overexpression of **OsSRT1** enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress.
   - Down-regulation of a SILENT INFORMATION REGULATOR2-related histone deacetylase gene, **OsSRT1**, induces DNA fragmentation and cell death in rice.
   - **OsSRT1** is involved in rice seed development through regulation of starch metabolism gene expression.
   - In this work, we investigated the role of **OsSRT1** in rice seed development.
   - Down-regulation of **OsSRT1** induced higher expression of Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1) and amylases genes in developing seeds, which resulted in a decrease of starch synthesis and an increase of starch degradation, leading to abnormal seed development.
   - ChIP assay showed that **OsSRT1** was required to reduce histone H3K9 acetylation on starch metabolism genes and transposons in developing seeds.
   - In addition, **OsSRT1** was detected to directly bind to starch metabolism genes such as OsAmy3B, OsAmy3E, OsBmy4, and OsBmy9.
   - **OsSRT1** is a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase, closely related to the human SIRT6 that plays key roles in genome stability and metabolic homeostasis.
   - We show that **OsSRT1** reduces GAPDH lysine acetylation and nuclear accumulation that are enhanced by oxidative stress.
   - Rice NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase **OsSRT1** represses glycolysis and regulates the moonlighting function of GAPDH as a transcriptional activator of glycolytic genes..
   - The results indicate that **OsSRT1** represses glycolysis by both regulating epigenetic modification of histone and inhibiting the moonlighting function of GAPDH as a transcriptional activator of glycolytic genes in rice.
