## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of an atypical bHLH, named POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (**PGL1**), in lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in transgenic rice.
   - Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (**PGL1**) and ANTAGONIST OF **PGL1** (APG), is involved in controlling rice grain length.
   - These findings suggest that PGL2 and **PGL1** redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG.
   - **PGL1**-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by **PGL1**.
   - Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the **PGL1**-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants.
