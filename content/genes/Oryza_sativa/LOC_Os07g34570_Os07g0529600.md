- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0529600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0529600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsDR8
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Exogenous application of thiamine could complement the compromised defense of the **OsDR8**-silenced plants.
   - The expression level of several defense-responsive genes including the earlier functional genes of defense transduction pathway, OsPOX and OsPAL, and the downstream genes of the pathway, OsPR1a, OsPR1b, OsPR4, OsPR5 and OsPR10, was also decreased in the **OsDR8**-silenced plants.
   - These results suggest that the impact of **OsDR8** on disease resistance in rice may be through the regulation of expression of other defense-responsive genes and the site of **OsDR8** function is on the upstream of the signal transduction pathway.
   - The function of **OsDR8**, a rice disease resistance-responsive gene, was studied.
   - Dual function of rice **OsDR8** gene in disease resistance and thiamine accumulation.
