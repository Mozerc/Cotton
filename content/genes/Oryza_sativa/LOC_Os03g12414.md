## Functional Descriptions:
   - Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice **SDS** and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens.
   - Because rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, are members of monocots and eudicots, two largest groups of flowering plants, our results suggest that the functions of **SDS** and RCK are likely conserved in flowering plants.
   - The Arabidopsis **SDS** (SOLO DANCERS) and RCK (ROCK-N-ROLLERS) genes are important for male meiosis, but it is still unknown whether they represent conserved functions in plants.
   - Functional conservation of the meiotic genes **SDS** and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice.
   - **SDS** deficiency also caused a decrease in pollen amounts.
   - Further cytological examination of male meiocytes revealed that the **SDS** deficiency led to defects in homolog interaction and bivalent formation in meiotic prophase I, and RCK deficiency resulted in defective meiotic crossover formation.
   - The **OsSDS** mutant is normal in vegetative growth but both male and female gametes are inviable.
   - No Î³H2AX immunosignals in **OsSDS** meiocytes together with the suppression of chromosome fragmentation in **OsSDS**-1 Osrad51c, both provide strong evidences that **OsSDS** is essential for meiotic DSB formation.
   - Immunostaining investigations revealed that meiotic chromosome axes are normally formed but both SC installation and localization of recombination elements are failed in **OsSDS**.
