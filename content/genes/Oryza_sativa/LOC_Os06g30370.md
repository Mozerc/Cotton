## Functional Descriptions:
   - In addition, transcription factor OsLFL1 was verified to directly bind to the promoter of **OsMFT1** via an RY motif and activate the expression of **OsMFT1** in vivo and in vitro.
   - **OsMFT1** increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.
   - Overexpressing **OsMFT1** delayed heading date by over 7 d and greatly increased spikelets per panicle and the number of branches.
   - In contrast, **OsMFT1** knockout mutants had an advanced heading date and reduced spikelets per panicle.
   - RNA-seq and RNA in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that **OsMFT1** repressed expression of FZP and five SEPALLATA-like genes, indicating that the transition from branch meristem to spikelet meristem was delayed and thus more panicle branches were produced.
   - Therefore, **OsMFT1** is a suppressor of flowering acting downstream of Ghd7 and upstream of Ehd1, and a positive regulator of panicle architecture.
   - **OsMFT1** was found to interact with two key drought-related transcription factors, OsbZIP66 and OsMYB26, and regulates their binding capacity on drought-related genes, thus enhancing drought tolerance in rice.
   - Nuclear Translocation of **OsMFT1** That is Impeded by OsFTIP1 Promotes Drought Tolerance in Rice.
   - These results demonstrate that dynamic modulation of drought responsive genes by **OsMFT1**-OsMYB26 complex and **OsMFT1**-OsbZIP66 complex is integral to OsFTIP1 effect on impeding nuclear translocation of **OsMFT1**.
   - Our findings suggest that **OsMFT1** acts as a hitherto unknown nucleocytoplasmic trafficking signal that regulates drought tolerance in rice in response to environmental signals.
   - **OsMFT1** inhibits seed germination through modulating abscisic acid signaling and gibberellin biosynthesis under salt stress in rice.
   - Overexpression of **OsMFT1** (**OsMFT1**OE) or OsMFT2 increased the sensitivity to salt stress during seed germination.
   - Transcriptome comparisons of **OsMFT1** vs WT in the absence and presence of salt stress yielded several differentially expressed genes, which were associated with salt stress, plant hormone metabolism, and signaling pathways, such as B-BOX ZINC FINGER 6, Oryza sativa bZIP PROTEIN 8, and GIBBERELLIN (GA) 20-oxidase 1.
   - In addition, the sensitivity of **OsMFT1**OE seeds to GA and **OsMFT1** seeds to ABA during seed germination increased under salt stress.
   - In this study, we found that seeds of loss-of-function **OsMFT1** mutants germinated faster than wild-type (WT) seeds under salt stress, but this was not the case for loss-of-function osmft2 mutants.
