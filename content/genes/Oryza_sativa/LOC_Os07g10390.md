## Functional Descriptions:
   - ) spotted leaf 5 (**spl5**) indicates that wild-type **spl5** negatively regulates cell death and resistance responses.
   - Bioinformatic analysis showed that SPL5 gene encodes a putative splicing factor 3b subunit 3 (**SF3b3**) and might be involved in splicing reactions of pre-mature RNAs participating in the regulation of cell death and resistance responses.
   - The data presented here clearly indicate that the **spl5** negatively regulates cell death and resistance responses via modulating RNA splicing in plants.
   - SPL5, a cell death and defense-related gene, encodes a putative splicing factor 3b subunit 3 (**SF3b3**) in rice.
   - Rice mutant, **spl5** (spotted leaf 5), has spontaneous hypersensitive-like lesions on its leaves and shows enhanced resistance to pathogens, indicating that **spl5** plays a role in programmed cell death (PCD) and disease resistance.
   - Since the serotonin plays a critical role in inducing disease-resistance, the increased serotonin level may contribute, at least partly, to the disease resistance in **spl5**.
   - The **spl5** gene may act as a negative regulatory factor activating the serotonin metabolic pathway, and these results might provide a new insight into the **spl5**-induced defense response mechanisms in plants.
   - Interestingly, according to our microarray and real-time PCR assays, the expressions of a transcription factor OsWRKY14 and genes responsible for the biosynthesis of serotonin, anthranilate synthase (AS), indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase (IGPS), tryptophan synthase (TS) and tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) were significantly up-regulated in the **spl5** mutant.
   - Transcriptome profiling of the **spl5** mutant reveals that **spl5** has a negative role in the biosynthesis of serotonin for rice disease resistance.
   - A 1.84-Mb region on rice chromosome 2 carrying SPL4, **spl5** and MLO8 genes is associated with higher yield under phosphorus-deficient acidic soil.
