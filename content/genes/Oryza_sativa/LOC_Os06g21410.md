- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0319133](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0319133)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OSIAGP</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The homology of **OSIAGP** with AGP23 and the fact that seedling growth in the dark and pollen tube growth are events based on cell elongation strengthen the possibility of **OSIAGP** performing a similar function.
   - Characterization of a pollen-preferential gene **OSIAGP** from rice (Oryza sativa L. subspecies indica) coding for an arabinogalactan protein homologue, and analysis of its promoter activity during pollen development and pollen tube growth.
   - **OSIAGP** transcripts also accumulate in shoots and roots of rice seedling grown in the dark, but light represses expression of the gene.
   - Analysis of a genomic clone of **OSIAGP** revealed that its promoter contains several pollen-specificity and light-regulatory elements.
   - During differential screening of inflorescence-specific cDNA libraries from Oryza sativa indica, an arabinogalactan protein (**OSIAGP**) cDNA (586 bp) expressing preferentially in the inflorescence has been isolated.
