## Functional Descriptions:
   - The AGC kinase OsOxi1, which has been isolated as an interactor with **OsPti1a**, positively regulates basal disease resistance in rice.
   - We show here that OsPdk1 acts upstream of the OsOxi1-**OsPti1a** signal cascade in disease resistance in rice.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that OsPdk1 positively regulates basal disease resistance through the OsOxi1-**OsPti1a** phosphorylation cascade in rice.
   - Pdk1 Kinase Regulates Basal Disease Resistance Through the OsOxi1-**OsPti1a** Phosphorylation Cascade in Rice.
   - To investigate the molecular function of **OsPti1a** in defense responses, we searched for components interacting with **OsPti1a** using a yeast two-hybrid system.
   - Taken together, our data suggest that OsOxi1 positively regulates defense responses through the phosphorylation of **OsPti1a**, causing the release from an **OsPti1a**-dependent inhibition of the responses.
   - OsOxi1 phosphorylates Thr-233 of **OsPti1a** and a point mutation of Thr-233 enhanced disease susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - Phosphorylation of a conserved threonine in **OsPti1a** is necessary to activate defense responses; however, the regulatory mechanism of **OsPti1a**-mediated immune responses is still obscure.
   - Recently, we revealed that **OsPti1a** forms protein complex(es) at the plasma membrane and this localization is required for its function.
   - These results suggest that **OsPti1a** protein is selectively regulated by its phosphorylation after **OsPti1a** localizes to the plasma membrane.
   - **OsPti1a** (Pto-interacting protein 1a) has important roles in the regulation of immune responses in rice.
