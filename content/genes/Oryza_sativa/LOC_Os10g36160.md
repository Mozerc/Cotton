## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g36160](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g36160)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0505500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0505500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsLTPL159
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The lipid transfer protein **OsLTPL159** is involved in cold tolerance at the early seedling stage in rice.
   - In addition, down-regulation of the expression of **OsLTPL159** in the japonica variety ZH17 by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly decreased cold tolerance.
   - Notably, overexpression of another allele, **OsLTPL159**GC2 , from the recipient parent Guichao 2 (GC2), an indica variety, did not improve cold tolerance, indicating that the variations in the **OsLTPL159** coding region of GC2 might disrupt its function for cold tolerance.
   - Further sequence comparison found that all 22 japonica varieties surveyed had an **OsLTPL159** haplotype identical to IL112 and were more cold-tolerant than the surveyed indica varieties, implying that the variations in **OsLTPL159** might be associated with differential cold tolerance of japonica and indica rice.
   - Therefore, our findings suggest that the **OsLTPL159** allele of japonica rice could be used to improve cold tolerance of indica rice through a molecular breeding strategy.
