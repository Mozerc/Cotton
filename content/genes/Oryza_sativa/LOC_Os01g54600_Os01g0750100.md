## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, **OsWRKY13** will provide a transgenic tool for engineering wider-spectrum and whole-growth-stage resistance rice in breeding programs.
   - At least 39 transcription factor genes were influenced by **OsWRKY13**, and 30 of them were downregulated.
   - The promoters of **OsWRKY13**-upregulated genes were overrepresented with W-boxes for WRKY protein binding, whereas the promoters of **OsWRKY13**-downregulated genes were enriched with cis-elements putatively for binding of MYB and AP2/EREBP types of transcription factors.
   - CONCLUSION: These results suggest that **OsWRKY13**-mediated signalling pathways are partitioned by different transcription factors.
   - In this study, we identified cis-acting elements and their binding proteins of rice **OsWRKY13**, a gene that plays a pivotal role in disease resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens.
   - These results suggest that **OsWRKY13** expression is regulated by multiple factors to achieve disease resistance.
   - Identification of novel pathogen-responsive cis-elements and their binding proteins in the promoter of **OsWRKY13**, a gene regulating rice disease resistance.
   - BACKGROUND: Rice transcription regulator **OsWRKY13** influences the functioning of more than 500 genes in multiple signalling pathways, with roles in disease resistance, redox homeostasis, abiotic stress responses, and development.
   - Here, we show that **OsWRKY13** plays a pivotal role in rice disease resistance.
   - **OsWRKY13** mediates rice disease resistance by regulating defense-related genes in salicylate- and jasmonate-dependent signaling.
   - Overexpression of **OsWRKY13** can enhance rice resistance to bacterial blight and fungal blast, two of the most devastating diseases of rice worldwide, at both the seedling and adult stages, and shows no influence on the fertility.
   - The **OsWRKY13**-associated disease resistance pathway synergistically interacts via **OsWRKY13** with the glutathione/glutaredoxin system and flavonoid biosynthesis pathway to monitor redox homeostasis and to putatively enhance the biosynthesis of antimicrobial flavonoid phytoalexins, respectively, in **OsWRKY13**-overexpressing lines.
   - Meanwhile, the **OsWRKY13**-associated disease resistance pathway appears to interact antagonistically with the SNAC1-mediated abiotic stress defense pathway, jasmonic acid signaling pathway, and terpenoid metabolism pathway via **OsWRKY13** to suppress salt and cold defense responses as well as to putatively retard rice growth and development.
   - Rice gene network inferred from expression profiling of plants overexpressing **OsWRKY13**, a positive regulator of disease resistance.
   - These results suggest that **OsWRKY13**, as an activator of the SA-dependent pathway and a suppressor of JA-dependent pathways, mediates rice resistance by directly or indirectly regulating the expression of a subset of genes acting both upstream and downstream of SA and JA.
   - Here we report that **OsWRKY13**, an activator of rice resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, appears to function as a convergent point for crosstalk among the pathogen-induced salicylate-dependent defense pathway and five other physiologic pathways.
   - WRKY45-2, functioning as a transcriptional activator, directly activated **WRKY13**.
   - Previous studies have revealed that rice **WRKY13** (as a transcriptional repressor) and WRKY45-2 enhance resistance to M.
   - To compute and evaluate the possible molecular mechanism for observed resistance correlated to **WRKY13** gene expression, rice gene expression profiles against bacterial leaf blight and leaf blast disease from ROAD database were used to prioritize the locus IDs that were used as input in RiceNet v2 tool.
   - Gene network mediated by **WRKY13** to regulate resistance against sheath infecting fungi in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - Agrobacterium mediated transformation was carried out in rice plants using overexpression construct of **WRKY13** (agroinfection in seeds of varieties susceptible to sheath blight and sheath rot, followed by selection in antibiotic media, germinating and hardening of putative transgenic lines).
   - RT-PCR and qPCR analyses of **WRKY13** using RNA extracted from the plant tissues revealed higher **WRKY13** expression in resistant varieties (both diseases) upon pathogen challenge compared to uninfected control and also the susceptible varieties.
