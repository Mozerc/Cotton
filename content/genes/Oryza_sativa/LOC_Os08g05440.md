## Functional Descriptions:
   - To physically map this locus, the **Pi36**(t)-linked markers were mapped by electronic hybridization to bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) or P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) clones of Nipponbare, and a contig map was constructed in silico through Pairwise BLAST analysis.
   - Genetic and physical mapping of **Pi36**(t), a novel rice blast resistance gene located on rice chromosome 8.
   - The effect of the rice blast resistance gene **Pi36** on the expression of disease resistance-related genes.
   - Interaction between the coiled-coil domain of rice blast resistance protein **Pi36** and methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) was studied by fluorescence and UV-vis spectroscopic techniques.
   - Study on the interaction between methyl jasmonate and the coiled-coil domain of rice blast resistance protein **Pi36** by spectroscopic methods.
   - The **Pi36**-encoded protein is composed of 1056 amino acids, with a single substitution event (Asp to Ser) at residue 590 associated with the resistant phenotype.
   - The induction of the expression of genes from both of these families suggests that both the JA and SA pathways are involved in **Pi36**-mediated defence.
   - The resistance gene **Pi36** confers a stable and high level of resistance against Chinese isolates of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - The binding sites of MeJA with the coiled-coil structural domain of rice blast resistance protein **Pi36** were found to approach the microenvironment of both Tyr and Trp by the synchronous fluorescence spectrometry.
   - The distance r between donor (the coiled-coil domain of rice blast resistance protein **Pi36**) and acceptor (MeJA) was obtained according to Forster theory of non-radioactive energy transfer.
   - The indica rice variety Kasalath carries **Pi36**, a gene that determines resistance to Chinese isolates of rice blast and that has been located to a 17-kb interval on chromosome 8.
   - Constructs containing each candidate gene were transformed into the blast-susceptible variety Q1063, which allowed the identification of **Pi36**-3 as the functional gene, with the other two candidates being probable pseudogenes.
   - **Pi36** is a single-copy gene in rice and is more closely related to the barley powdery mildew resistance genes Mla1 and Mla6 than to the rice blast R genes Pita, Pib, Pi9, and Piz-t.
   - The in silico map-based cloning of **Pi36**, a rice coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat gene that confers race-specific resistance to the blast fungus.
