## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g49680](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g49680)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0691600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0691600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsXPB2</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The present research revealed that **OsXPB2** promoter contains cis-elements accounting for various abiotic stresses (salt, dehydration, or cold) and hormone (Auxin, ABA, or MeJA) induced GUS expression/activity in the promoter-reporter assay.
   - The present findings suggest that **OsXPB2** promoter is a multi-stress inducible promoter and has potential applications in sustainable crop production under abiotic stresses by regulating desirable pattern of gene expression.
   - The promoter region of **OsXPB2** contains CACG, GTAACG, CACGTG, CGTCA CCGCCGCGCT cis acting-elements which are reported to be salt, dehydration, cold, MeJA, or ABA responsive, respectively.
   - The in vivo validation of functionality/activity of **OsXPB2** promoter under abiotic and hormonal stress conditions was performed by Agrobacterium-mediated transient assay in tobacco leaves using **OsXPB2**::GUS chimeric construct.
