## Functional Descriptions:
   - RNA interference (RNAi) of **Ostrxm** resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content.
   - Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in **Ostrxm** RNAi plants.
   - **Ostrxm** was localized in chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells, and the recombinant protein showed dithiothreitol-dependent insulin beta-chain reduction activity in vitro.
   - The pleiotropic effects of **Ostrxm** RNAi suggest that **Ostrxm** plays an important role in the redox regulation of chloroplast target proteins involved in diverse physiological functions.
   - Protein interaction experiments revealed that OsMESL affects reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation by interacting with thioredoxin **Ostrxm** in rice.
