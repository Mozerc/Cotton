## Functional Descriptions:
   - Being consistent, transgenic plants with OsIAA12 overexpression or deficiency of **OsARF17** which interacts with OsIAA12 do present enlarged leaf inclination.
   - Distinct modes of manipulation of rice auxin response factor **OsARF17** by different plant RNA viruses for infection..
   - This suggests that **OsARF17** plays a crucial role in plant defense against different types of plant viruses, and that these viruses use independently evolved viral proteins to target this key component of auxin signaling and facilitate infection.
   - **OsARF17** also confers resistance to a cytorhabdovirus and was directly targeted by one of the viral proteins.
   - We show here that two fijiviruses (double-stranded RNA viruses) utilize their proteins to disturb the dimerization of **OsARF17** and repress its transcriptional activation ability, while a tenuivirus (negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus) directly interferes with the DNA binding activity of **OsARF17**.
   - miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.
   - RT-qPCR assays showed that the induction of plant defense-related genes, such as WRKY transcription factors, OsAHT2 and OsDR8, and JA-related genes, were significantly suppressed in **OsARF17** mutants in response to RSMV.
   - Our previous studies have indicated that auxin response factor **OsARF17** plays a crucial role in plant defense against diverse rice viruses.
   - METHODS: Utilizing a comparative transcriptome analysis of Rice stripe mosaic virus (RSMV)-inoculated **OsARF17** mutant rice plants, to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of **OsARF17** in antiviral defense pathway.
   - RESULTS: KEGG enrichment analyses showed that the down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belonged to plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signal transduction pathways were markedly enriched in **OsARF17** mutants under RSMV inoculation.
