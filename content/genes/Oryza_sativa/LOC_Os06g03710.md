## Functional Descriptions:
   - Briefly, these results demonstrated that the D62 (DLT/**OsGRAS-32**) not only participated in the regulation of BR signaling, but also influenced GA metabolism in rice.
   - In addition, a ggc repeat region identified in the region that encodes the GRAS domain of **GS6** played an important historic role in the domestication of grain size in rice.
   - DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (**DLT**) is a positive regulator that mediates several BR responses in rice.
   - Here, we characterized a rice dwarf and low-tillering (**DLT**) mutant and cloned the corresponding gene via map-based cloning.
   - In addition, both lamina bending and coleoptile elongation assays show that **DLT** is insensitive or much less responsive to brassinolide (BL), the most active BR, suggesting that **DLT** is involved in BR signaling.
   - Here, we report the identification and cloning of Grain Size 6 (**GS6**), which plays an important role in reducing grain size in rice.
   - **GS6**, a member of the GRAS gene family, negatively regulates grain size in rice.
   - The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in **D62** mutant.
   - RT-PCR analysis and promoter activity analysis showed that the **D62** gene expressed in all tested tissues including roots, stems, leaves and panicles of rice plant.
   - Suppression of **DLT** can enhance the phenotypes of BR receptor mutant d61-1, and overexpression of **DLT** obviously suppressed the BR loss-of-function phenotypes of both d61-1 and Go, suggesting that **DLT** functions downstream of GSK2 to modulate BR responses.
   - These results demonstrate that **DLT** is a GSK2 substrate, further reinforcing that the BIN2/GSK2 kinase has multiple substrates that carry out various BR responses.
   - A dwarf mutant, dwarf 62 (**D62**), was isolated from rice cultivar 93-11 by mutagenesis with gamma-rays.
   - Consistent with this conclusion, the accumulation of transcripts of BR biosynthesis genes in the **DLT** mutant indicated that **DLT** is involved in feedback inhibition of BR biosynthesis genes.
   - Finally, consistent with the fact that **DLT** is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the **DLT** promoter through the BR-response element.
   - In previous studies, the DLT/**OsGRAS-32** is confirmed to play positive roles in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling.
   - Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/**OsGRAS-32** affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice.
   - A premature stop at the +348 position in the coding sequence (CDS) of **GS6** increased grain width and weight significantly.
   - The **D62** mutant exhibited decreased activity of alpha-amylase in endosperm and reduced content of endogenous GA(1).
   - The dwarf phenotype of **DLT** is similar to BR-deficient or signaling mutants in rice.
   - Knowledge of the function of **GS6** might aid efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control grain development and evolution in rice plants, and could facilitate the genetic improvement of rice yield.
   - **DLT** physically interacts with OSH15 to co-regulate many genes in seedlings and internodes.
   - OSH15 targets and promotes the expression of the BR receptor gene BR INSENSITIVE1 (OsBRI1), and **DLT** facilitates this regulation in a dosage-dependent manner.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that **DLT** interacts with OSH15, which functions in the lower internodes, to modulate rice internode elongation via orchestrating BR signaling and metabolism.
   - Wide Grain 3, a GRAS Protein, Interacts with **DLT** to Regulate Grain Size and Brassinosteroid Signaling in Rice.
   - Moreover, we found that WG3 directly interacts with DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (**DLT**), a previously reported GRAS protein, and a genetic experiment demonstrated that WG3 and **DLT** function in a common pathway to regulate grain size.
