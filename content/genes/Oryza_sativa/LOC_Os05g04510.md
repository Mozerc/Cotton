## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results suggest that OsFBK12 is involved in the 26S proteasome pathway by interacting with Oryza sativa S-PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1-LIKE PROTEIN and that it targets the substrate **OsSAMS1** for degradation, triggering changes in ethylene levels for the regulation of leaf senescence and grain size.
   - Phenotypically, overexpression of OsFBK12 led to a delay in leaf senescence and germination and increased seed size, whereas knockdown lines of either OsFBK12 or **OsSAMS1** promoted the senescence program.
   - The F-box protein OsFBK12 targets **OsSAMS1** for degradation and affects pleiotropic phenotypes, including leaf senescence, in rice.
   - Here, we demonstrate that **OsSAMS1**, 2 and 3 are essential for histone H3K4me3 and DNA methylation to regulate gene expression related to flowering in Oryza sativa.
   - RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic rice with downregulated transcripts of **OsSAMS1**, 2 and 3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes, including dwarfism, reduced fertility, delayed germination, as well as late flowering.
   - Knockdown of **OsSAMS1**, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression of the flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT-like genes).
   - OsFBK12-RNA interference lines and **OsSAMS1** overexpression lines showed increased ethylene levels, while OsFBK12-OX lines and **OsSAMS1**-RNA interference plants exhibited decreased ethylene.
   - RDV-encoded Pns11 protein specifically interacted with **OsSAMS1** to enhance its enzymatic activity, leading to higher ethylene levels in both RDV-infected and Pns11-overexpressing rice.
