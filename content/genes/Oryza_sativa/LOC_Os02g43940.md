## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os02g43940](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g43940)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0656600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0656600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsDREB4-1</u>&nbsp;<u>CR223</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Under normal growth conditions, OsDREBI-1 was expressed strongly in the leaf, sheath, and spike, was expressed relatively weak in the stem and only faintly expressed in the roots, whereas expression of transcripts of **OsDREB4-1** and OsDREB4-2 was higher in the roots, stem, and spike, lower in the leaf, and undetectable in the sheath.
   - In rice seedlings, expression of **OsDREB4-1** was induced by dehydration and high salt, whereas OsDREBl-l and OsDREB4-2 were expressed constitutively.
