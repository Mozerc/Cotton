## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g29560](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g29560)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0431000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0431000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsPQT3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsPQT3** knockout mutants (**OsPQT3**) display enhanced resistance to oxidative and salt stress with elevated expression of OsGPX1, OsAPX1, and OsSOD1.
   - More importantly, the **OsPQT3** mutants show significantly enhanced agronomic performance with higher yield compared with the wild type under salt stress in greenhouse as well as in field conditions.
   - We further showed that **OsPQT3** expression rapidly decreased in response to oxidative and other abiotic stresses as AtPQT3 does.
   - Taken together, these results show that **OsPQT3** is functionally well conserved in rice as an off-switch in stress response as AtPQT3 in Arabidopsis.
