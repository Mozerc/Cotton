## Functional Descriptions:
   - These data suggest that **OsCLP**, which has chitinase activity, may play an important role in plant defenses against pathogens.
   - In addition, exogenous treatment with **OsCLP** affected the growth of the basidiomycete fungus Rhizoctonia solani through degradation of the hyphal cell wall.
   - A T-DNA insertion mutant of **OsCLP** (**OsCLP**) showed significant retardation of root and shoot growth.
   - A comparative proteomic analysis was carried out using root tissue of wild-type and the **OsCLP** mutant to understand the **OsCLP**-mediated rice growth retardation.
   - Exogenous application of Ca(2+) resulted in successful recovery of both primary and lateral root growth in **OsCLP**.
   - Moreover, overexpression of **OsCLP** resulted in improved growth with modified seed shape and starch structure; however, the overall yield remained unaffected.
   - Taken together, our results highlight the involvement of **OsCLP** in rice growth by regulating the intracellular calcium concentrations.
   - Results obtained revealed that proteins related to glycolysis (phosphoglycerate kinase), stress adaption (chaperonin) and calcium signaling (calreticulin and CDPK1) were differentially regulated in **OsCLP** roots.
   - Fura-2 molecular probe staining, which is an intracellular calcium indicator, and ICP-MS analysis suggested that the intracellular calcium content was significantly lower in roots of **OsCLP** as compared to the wild-type.
