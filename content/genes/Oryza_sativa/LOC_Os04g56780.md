## Functional Descriptions:
   - Morphological observation revealed that the formation of tiller buds was disrupted in **MOC3**.
   - The expression of **MOC3** was induced by cytokinins and defection of **MOC3** affected the expression of several two-component cytokinin response regulators, OsRRs and ORRs.
   - Homeobox Is Pivotal for **OsWUS** Controlling Tiller Development and Female Fertility in Rice.
   - **OsWUS** has recently been shown to be a transcription factor gene critical for tiller development and fertility in rice.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotypes were caused by a mutation in **OsWUS** Compared with the two previously reported null allelic mutants of **OsWUS** (tab1-1 and moc3-1), which could produce partial N-terminal peptides of **OsWUS**, the srt1 protein contained a deletion of only seven amino acids within the conserved homeobox domain of **OsWUS**.
   - Recently, we showed that a double mutant of FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1 (ASP1) led to a marked enlargement of the inflorescence meristem, and that the **TAB1** function is not associated with massive stem cells in this meristem.
   - In addition, misexpression of **TAB1** under the promoter of FON1 led to a slight reduction of the SAM size in wild type, suggesting that **TAB1** is not a positive regulator of stem cells.
   - In this paper, we confirmed that **TAB1** is also unrelated to the enlargement of the SAM in the vegetative phase of the fon2 and fon2 asp1 mutants.
   - Taking together, **TAB1** seems not to be involved in meristem maintenance, irrespective of the meristem type.
   - We revealed that stem cells were established at an early stage of axillary meristem development in wild type, but were not maintained in **TAB1**.
   - By contrast, the stem cell region and **TAB1** expression domain were expanded in fon2, and FON2 overexpression inhibited axillary meristem formation.
   - These results indicate that **TAB1** is required to maintain stem cells during axillary meristem development, whereas FON2 negatively regulates stem cell fate by restricting **TAB1** expression.
   - **OsWUS** promotes tiller bud growth by establishing weak apical dominance in rice.
   - Auxin response is enhanced in the dc1 mutant, and knocking out the auxin action-associated gene ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE 1 (ASP1) de-repressed growth of the tiller buds in the dc1 mutant, suggesting that **OsWUS** and ASP1 are both involved in outgrowth of the rice tiller bud.
   - Collectively, these findings reveal an important role of **OsWUS** in tiller bud growth by influencing apical dominance, and provide the basis for an improved understanding of tiller bud development in rice.
   - In this study, we identified and functionally characterized a low-tillering mutant decreased culm number 1 (dc1) that resulted from loss-of-function of **OsWUS**.
   - Our results suggest that **OsWUS** is a precise regulatory element, its specific spatio-temporal expression pattern is critical for its function, and both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations lead to abnormal plant growth.
   - Changes in the expression pattern of **OsWUS** negatively regulate plant stature and panicle development in rice.
   - **OsWUS** have distinct functions in meristem development with slightly tuned expression.
