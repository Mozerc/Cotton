## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os06g13070](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g13070)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0237900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0237900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsDML4</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of two transcription factor genes RISBZ1 and RPBF was significantly decreased in the **OsDML4** mutants, which caused adverse effects on the formation of protein bodies (PBs) with greatly decreased PB-II number, and incomplete and abnormally shaped PB-IIs.
   - No significant difference was detected between the wild type and **OsDML4** mutants under normal temperature.
   - Here, we identified a new demethylase gene **OsDML4** and discovered its function in cytosine demethylation to affect endosperm formation.
   - Loss of function of **OsDML4** induced chalky endosperm only under HT and dramatically reduced the transcription and accumulation of glutelins and 16 kDa prolamin.
