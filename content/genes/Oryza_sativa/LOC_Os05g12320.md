- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsSWEET3a** expression co-localized with OsGA20ox1 expression in the vascular bundles but not with OsGA3ox2, whose expression was restricted to leaf primordia and young leaves.
   - Quantitative reverse transcription PCR, GUS staining, and in situ hybridization revealed that **OsSWEET3a** was expressed in vascular bundles in basal parts of the seedlings.
   - These results suggest that **OsSWEET3a** is expressed in the vascular tissue of basal parts of seedlings and is involved in the transport of both GA20 and glucose to young leaves, where GA20 is possibly converted to the bioactive GA1 form by OsGA3ox2, during early plant development.
   - The dual function of **OsSWEET3a** as a gibberellin and glucose transporter is important for young shoot development in rice.
   - Both knockout and overexpression lines of **OsSWEET3a** showed defects in germination and early shoot development, which were partially restored by GA, especially GA20.
   - **OsSWEET3a** efficiently transports GAs in the C13-hydroxylation pathway of GA biosynthesis.
