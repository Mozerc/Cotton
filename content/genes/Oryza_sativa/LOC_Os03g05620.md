## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) Pht1;1 (**OsPT1**), one of the 13 Pht1 Pi transporters in rice, was expressed abundantly and constitutively in various cell types of both roots and shoots.
   - **OsPT1** was able to complement the proton-coupled Pi transporter activities in a yeast mutant defective in Pi uptake.
   - Transgenic plants of **OsPT1** overexpression lines and RNA interference knockdown lines contained significantly higher and lower phosphorus concentrations, respectively, compared with the wild-type control in Pi-sufficient shoots.
   - **OsPT1**, however, was highly expressed in primary roots and leaves regardless of external phosphate concentrations.
   - This finding was confirmed histochemically using transgenic rice plants that express the GUS reporter gene under the control of the **OsPT1** promoter, which exhibited high GUS activity even in the phosphate sufficient condition.
   - Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing the **OsPT1** gene accumulated almost twice as much phosphate in the shoots as did wild-type plants.
   - Increased expression of **OsPT1**, a high-affinity phosphate transporter, enhances phosphate acquisition in rice.
   - Furthermore, **OsPT1** expression was strongly enhanced by the mutation of Phosphate Overaccumulator2 (OsPHO2) but not by Phosphate Starvation Response2, indicating that **OsPT1** is involved in the OsPHO2-regulated Pi pathway.
   - A constitutive expressed phosphate transporter, **OsPht1;1**, modulates phosphate uptake and translocation in phosphate-replete rice.
   - Considering the sequenced rice genome at hand, only the Oryza sativa phosphate transporter (OsPT) gene **OsPT1**1 was specifically induced during the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.
   - **OsPT1**1 expression complemented a defect in phosphate uptake in a yeast strain mutated in its high-affinity P(i) transporter (pho84), thereby confirming its function.
   - These results indicate that **OsPT1** is a key member of the Pht1 family involved in Pi uptake and translocation in rice under Pi-replete conditions.
   - **OsPT1**1 activation was independent of the nutritional status of the plant and phosphate availability in the rhizosphere.
   - Moreover, infection of roots with the fungal pathogens Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium moniliforme did not activate **OsPT1**1, corroborating the high signal specificity for **OsPT1**1 activation in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.
   - Finally, the dynamic transcriptional regulation of OsRNS genes by overexpression of OsPHR2, ospho2 mutant, and overexpression of **OsPT1** lines involved in Pi signaling pathway suggests the molecular basis of OsRNS family in Pi recycling via RNA decay under Pi starvation.
