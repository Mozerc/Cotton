## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsBBPI** was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction.
   - However, a simultaneous application of salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA), with JA, respectively, completely blocked **OsBBPI** gene expression, whereas kinetin (KN) was only partially effective.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that among the phytohormones tested here, JA and ethylene play important role(s) in regulating **OsBBPI** expression, with an intimate interaction with light signals.
   - Besides JA, it was found that the ethylene generator ethephon (ET) also had an enhancing effect on **OsBBPI** transcript, suggesting a direct effect of ethylene on **OsBBPI** expression.
   - To the best of our knowledge, complete inhibition of JA-induced **OsBBPI** expression by SA is the first report in monocots, and with ABA in plants.
