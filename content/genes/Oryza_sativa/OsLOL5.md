## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsLOL5</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing **OsLOL5** grew well in the presence ofboth NaCl and NaHCO3 treatments, whereas wild-type plants exhibited chlorosis, stunted growth phenotype, and even death.
   - Transgenic rice overexpressing **OsLOL5** exhibited stronger resistance than NT under NaHCO3 treatment, as demonstrated by its greater shoot length, and fresh weight.
   - These findings illustrated that **OsLOL5** overexpression enhanced yeast resistance for SA stress through active oxygen species.
   - A rice LSD1-like-type ZFP gene **OsLOL5** enhances saline-alkaline tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, yeast and rice.
   - The present study further revealed that **OsLOL5** ZFP could regulate oxidative stress function, but could also provide a basis for salt-resistant rice strains.
   - The results suggested that **OsLOL5** improved SA tolerance in plants, and regulated oxidative and salinity stress retardation via the active oxygen detoxification pathway.
   - Overexpression of **OsLOL5** in yeast resulted in SA tolerance at significant level.
   - **OsLOL5** was located in the nucleus as evidenced by the bombardment of onion epidermal cells.
