## Functional Descriptions:
   - The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in **TCD5** plants at 20 °C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development.
   - Although the phenotype and temperature dependence of the **TCD5** orthologous mutant phenotype were different in rice and Arabidopsis, Os**TCD5** could rescue the phenotype of the Arabidopsis mutant, suggesting that **TCD5** function is conserved between monocots and dicots.
   - The development of thylakoid membranes is arrested at the mid-P4 stage in **TCD5** plants at 20 °C.
   - The transcription of some genes involved in plastid transcription/translation and photosynthesis varied in the **TCD5** mutant.
   - Furthermore, **CSV1** transcripts were more abundant in immature than in mature leaves, and they did not markedly increase or decrease with temperature.
   - The growth of **CSV1** plants displayed sensitivity to low temperatures.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **CSV1** supports chloroplast development under cold stress conditions, in both the early growth and tillering stages in rice.
   - These results provide novel insights into ways in which rice chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis are protected by **TSV** under cold stress.
   - We isolated and identified **TSV** by map-based cloning and rescue experiments, combined with genetic, cytological and molecular biological analyses.
   - The activity of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and the expression of genes participating in chlorophyll synthesis were severely reduced in the **TSV** mutant under cold stress, but not at normal temperatures.
   - We demonstrated that **TSV** protects rice chloroplasts from cold stress by interacting with OsTrxZ.
