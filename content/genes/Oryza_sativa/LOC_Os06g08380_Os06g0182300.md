- **Gene Symbol:** GSL5,OsGSL5
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by **GSL5** plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice.
   - In **OsGSL5** mutant anthers mostly lacking callose deposition, aberrant PMCs accompanied by aggregated, unpaired, or multivalent chromosomes were frequently observed and, furthermore, a considerable number of mutant PMCs had untimely progress into meiosis compared to that of wild-type PMCs.
   - Immunostaining of meiosis-specific protein HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS2 in premeiotic PMCs revealed precocious meiosis entry in **OsGSL5** anthers.
