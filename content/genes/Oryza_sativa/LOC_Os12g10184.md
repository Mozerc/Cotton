## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g10184](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g10184)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** PGL12
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We also showed that the transcript levels of several nuclear- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis were significantly altered in **PGL12** mutants.
   - Our results indicate that **PGL12** is a new PLS-type PPR protein required for proper chloroplast development and 16S rRNA processing in rice.
   - The **PGL12** mutant had significantly reduced chlorophyll contents and increased sensitivity to changes in temperature.
   - In this study, we identified and characterized a rice mutant, pale-green leaf12 (**PGL12**); at the seedling stage, **PGL12** mutants had yellow-green leaves, which gradually turned pale green as the plants grew.
   - Map-based cloning of **PGL12**, including a transgenic complementation test, confirmed the presence of a base substitution (C to T), generating a stop codon, within LOC_Os12g10184 in the **PGL12** mutant.
