- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - OsSPX1 suppresses the function of OsPHR2 in the regulation of expression of **OsPT2** and phosphate homeostasis in shoots of rice.
   - * **OsPT2**, the most abundantly expressed Pi transporter in the roots, is also significantly up-regulated in ltn1 and dramatically induced by Pi starvation.
   - * These data strongly demonstrate that selenite and Pi share similar uptake mechanisms and that **OsPT2** is involved in selenite uptake, which provides a potential strategy for breeding Se-enriched rice varieties.
   - Taken together, these data suggest OsPT6 plays a broad role in Pi uptake and translocation throughout the plant, whereas **OsPT2** is a low-affinity Pi transporter, and functions in translocation of the stored Pi in the plant.
   - **OsPT2** is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess Pi in shoots.
   - **OsPT2**, a phosphate transporter, is involved in the active uptake of selenite in rice.
   - Expression of **OsPT2** (phosphate transporter 2) and OsPT8 was significantly induced in OsSPX1-RNAi (OsSPX1-Ri) plants, suggesting that over-accumulation of Pi in OsSPX1-Ri plants results from an increase in Pi transport.
   - In contrast, overexpression of OsSPX1 suppressed the induction of expression by Pi starvation of all 10 phosphate starvation-induced genes tested: IPS1 (induced by phosphate starvation 1), IPS2, OsPAP10 (purple acid phosphatase 10), OsSQD2 (sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2), miR399d and miR399j (microRNA 399), **OsPT2**, OsPT3, OsPT6 and OsPT8.
   - In transgenic rice, the knock-down of either **OsPT2** or OsPT6 expression by RNA interference significantly decreased both the uptake and the long-distance transport of Pi from roots to shoots.
   - Two rice phosphate transporters, **OsPht1;2** and OsPht1;6, have different functions and kinetic properties in uptake and translocation.
   - Se content in rice grains also increased significantly in **OsPT2**-overexpressing plants.
   - OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter **OsPT2** through physical interaction and reciprocal regulation of OsPHO2 in roots.
   - OsPT6, but not **OsPT2**, was able to complement a yeast Pi uptake mutant in the high-affinity concentration range.
   - Xenopus oocytes injected with **OsPT2** mRNA showed increased Pi accumulation and a Pi-elicited depolarization of the cell membrane electrical potential, when supplied with mM external concentrations.
   - Both results show that **OsPT2** mediated the uptake of Pi in oocytes.
   - Moreover, expression of **OsPT2**, which encodes a low-affinity Pi transporter, was up-regulated in OsMYB2P-1-overexpressing plants under Pi-sufficient conditions, whereas expression of the high-affinity Pi transporters OsPT6, OsPT8, and OsPT10 was up-regulated by overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 under Pi-deficient conditions, suggesting that OsMYB2P-1 may act as a Pi-dependent regulator in controlling the expression of Pi transporters.
   - Here we report that OsPHR2 positively regulates the low-affinity Pi transporter gene **OsPT2** by physical interaction and upstream regulation of OsPHO2 in roots.
   - OsSPX1 suppresses the regulation on expression of **OsPT2** by OsPHR2 and the accumulation of excess shoot Pi, but it does not suppress induction of **OsPT2** or the accumulation of excessive shoot Pi in the Ospho2 mutant.
   - The data indicate that mutation of OsPHF1 results in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of the low-affinity Pi transporter **OsPT2** and high-affinity Pi transporter OsPT8.
   - By using transgenic rice plants expressing the GUS reporter gene, driven by their promoters, we detected that **OsPT2** was localized exclusively in the stele of primary and lateral roots, whereas OsPT6 was expressed in both epidermal and cortical cells of the younger primary and lateral roots.
   - **OsPT2** is responsible for most of the OsPHR2-mediated accumulation of excess shoot Pi.
   - Differential effects of nitrogen forms on cell wall phosphorus remobilization in rice (Oryza sativa) are mediated by nitric oxide, pectin content and the expression of the phosphate transporter **OsPT2**.
   - What's more, the phosphate transporter gene **OsPT2** is upregulated under NH4+ supplementation and is therefore involved in the stimulated P remobilization.
   - Constitutive over-expression of **OsPT2** may have negative effects on the growth of rice seedlings under high Pi condition.
   - Under Pi-sufficient condition, there were a series of symptoms of phosphorus toxicity in the shoots of **OsPT2** over-expressing (Ov-**OsPT2**) seedlings.
   - Over-expression of **OsPT2** under a rice root specific promoter Os03g01700..
   - Rice plants overexpressing OsPP95 reduced OsPT8 phosphorylation and promoted **OsPT2** and OsPT8 trafficking from the ER to the PM, resulting in Pi accumulation.
   - We demonstrate that the protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C) protein phosphatase OsPP95 interacts with **OsPT2** and OsPT8 and dephosphorylates OsPT8 at Ser-517.
   - High Zn supply triggered P starvation signal in root, thereafter increased the activities of both root-endogenous and -secreted acid phosphatase to release more Pi, and induced the expression **OsPT2** and OsPT8 to uptake more P for plant growth.
   - Our results showed that high level of Zn decreased the rice biomass and yield production, and inhibited the root-to-shoot translocation and distribution of P into new leaves by down-regulating P transporter genes **OsPT2** and OsPT8 in shoot, which was controlled by OsPHR2-OsmiR399-OsPHO2 module.
   - The transcription factor OsWRKY10 inhibits phosphate uptake via suppressing **OsPht1;2** expression under phosphate-replete condition in rice..
   - Genetic analysis showed that **OsPht1;2** was responsible for the increased Pi accumulation in oswrky10.
