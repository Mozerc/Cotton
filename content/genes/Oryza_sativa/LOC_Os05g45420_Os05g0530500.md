## Functional Descriptions:
   - CIPK15 regulates the plant global energy and stress sensor **SnRK1A** (Snf1-related protein kinase 1) and links O(2)-deficiency signals to the SnRK1-dependent sugar-sensing cascade to regulate sugar and energy production and to enable rice growth under floodwater.
   - Our studies demonstrated that **SnRK1A** is an important intermediate in the sugar signaling cascade, functioning upstream from the interaction between MYBS1 and alphaAmy3 SRC and playing a key role in regulating seed germination and seedling growth in rice.
   - The **SnRK1A** protein kinase plays a key role in sugar signaling during germination and seedling growth of rice.
   - **OsSnRK1a** overexpression interfered with normal growth and development and increased resistance against both (hemi)biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, while **OsSnRK1a** silencing in RNAi lines increased susceptibility.
   - The energy sensor **OsSnRK1a** confers broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice..
   - **OsSnRK1a** overexpression positively affected the salicylic acid pathway and boosted the jasmonate-mediated defense response after inoculation with the blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae.
   - Together these findings strongly suggest **OsSnRK1a** to be involved in plant basal immunity and favor a model whereby **OsSnRK1a** acts as a master switch that regulates growth-immunity trade-offs.
   - Accelerated NSC transport was accompanied by increased levels of **OsSnRK1a** mRNA expression, SnRK1a protein expression, catalytic subunit phosphorylation of SnRK1, and SnRK1 activity, indicating that SnRK1 activity plays an important role in sheath NSC transport.
   - Since SnRK1 activity is mostly regulated by **OsSnRK1a** transcription in response to low sucrose content, we constructed an snrk1a mutant to verify the function of SnRK1 in NSC transport.
   - **SnRK1A** is activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and positively regulates plant immune responses and disease resistance.
   - As a central mediator of energy signaling, **SnRK1A** interacts with and phosphorylates XB24 at Thr83 residue to promote ATPase activity.
   - Meanwhile, SCRE1 outcompetes **SnRK1A** for XB24 binding, and thereby suppresses **SnRK1A**-mediated phosphorylation and ATPase activity of XB24.
   - In this study, using translational reporter constructs transfected in Arabidopsis protoplasts we showed that the expression of **OsSnRK1a** and AtSnRK1.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that **OsSnRK1a** and AtSnRK1.1 suppress protein translation to maintain energy homeostasis..
   - In the OsUbc13-RNAi plants, although the protein level of **OsSnRK1a** did not change, its activity and ABA sensitivity were obviously enhanced, and the K63-linked polyubiquitination was weaker than that of wild-type Dongjin (DJ).
   - Our data demonstrate OsUbc13 negatively regulates immunity against pathogens by enhancing the activity of **OsSnRK1a**.
