- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Immunostaining with Lsi1 and **Lsi2** antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and **Lsi2** were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots.
   - Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter **Lsi2**, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly.
   - Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and **Lsi2** (an efflux carrier).
   - The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and **Lsi2**) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath.
   - Expression of **Lsi2** in Xenopus oocytes did not result in influx transport activity for silicon, but preloading of the oocytes with silicon resulted in a release of silicon, indicating that **Lsi2** is a silicon efflux transporter.
   - By contrast, **Lsi2** mutation had little effect on arsenite efflux to the external medium.
   - Mutation in **Lsi2** had a much greater impact on arsenic accumulation in shoots and grain in field-grown rice than Lsi1.
   - Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (**Lsi2**), which has no similarity to Lsi1.
   - There was a negative correlation between the expression level of OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2** and shoot Si accumulation when the rice seedlings were exposed to different Si supply conditions.
   - A split root experiment showed that the expression of both OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2** was also down-regulated in half the roots without direct Si exposure when the other half of the roots were exposed to Si.
   - The expression level of some transporter genes including OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2** for Si uptake and OsNramp5 for Mn uptake was significantly decreased in the mutant compared with the wild-type rice.
   - Root silicon deposition and its resultant reduction of sodium bypass flow is modulated by OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2** in rice.
   - In summary, our results reveal that Si deposition at root endodermis and its resultant reduction of Na+ bypass flow is modulated by OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2** and regulated by the expression of OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2**, implying that root Si deposition could be an active and physiologically-regulated process in rice.
   - In this study, we investigated the roles of OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2** in Si-induced reduction of bypass flow and its resultant alleviation of salt stress by using lsi1 and lsi2 mutants (defective in OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2**, respectively) and their wild types (WTs).
   - The polar localization of both OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2** was not altered by Si supply, but their protein abundance was reduced.
   - The polar localization of OsLsi1 and **OsLsi2** was not altered by inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by dominant-negative induction of dynamin-related protein1A and knockout of mu subunit of adaptor protein 2 complex, although the knockout mutants of OsAP2M gene showed dwarf phenotype.
