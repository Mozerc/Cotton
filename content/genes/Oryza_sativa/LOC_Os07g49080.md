## Functional Descriptions:
   - OsBC1L1 and **OsBC1L8** function in stomatal development in rice.
   - The expression of OsSPCH2 and OsFAMA, two genes key to stomatal development is both down-regulated in osbc1l1 **OsBC1L8**.
   - Taken together, these results suggest that OsBC1L1 and **OsBC1L8** play essential roles in the development of rice stomatal complex likely through their involvement in cell reproduction.
   - Both OsBC1L1 and **OsBC1L8** could be detected to be localized at the cell plate and plasma membrane during cell division of guard mother cells and subsidiary mother cells.
   - In this study, we demonstrated that knockout either OsBC1L1 or **OsBC1L8**, two close homologs of OsBC1L family causes no discernible defects in rice stomatal development, however, the double knockout mutant osbc1l1 **OsBC1L8** exhibits excess stomatal production and stomatal clustering.
   - Moreover, osbc1l1 **OsBC1L8** has many defective stomata complexes with only one subsidiary cell.
