## Functional Descriptions:
   - A lamin-like protein **OsNMCP1** regulates drought resistance and root growth through chromatin accessibility modulation by interacting with a chromatin remodeler OsSWI3C in rice.
   - **OsNMCP1** overexpression resulted in a deeper and thicker root system and enhanced drought resistance compared to the wild-type control.
   - The reported drought resistance or root growth related genes that were positively regulated by **OsNMCP1** were negatively regulated by OsSWI3C under drought stress conditions, and OsSWI3C overexpression led to decreased drought resistance.
   - We propose that the interaction between **OsNMCP1** and OsSWI3C under drought stress conditions may lead to the release of OsSWI3C from the SWI/SNF gene silencing complex, thus changing chromatin accessibility in the genes related to root growth and drought resistance.
   - We report that **OsNMCP1** is localized at the nuclear periphery and induced by drought stress.
