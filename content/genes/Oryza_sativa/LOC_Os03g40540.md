## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g40540](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g40540)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0602300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0602300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsDWARF</u>&nbsp;<u>OsBRD1</u>&nbsp;<u>OsBR6ox</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsDWARF** gene was expressed at a low level in all of the examined tissues, with preferential expression in the leaf sheath, and the expression was negatively regulated by brassinolide treatment.
   - Therefore, we cloned a rice gene, **OsDWARF**, which has a high sequence similarity to the tomato C-6 oxidase gene, DWARF.
   - Introduction of the wild-type **OsDWARF** gene into brd1 rescued the abnormal phenotype of the mutants.
   - Genetic disruption of **OsBR6ox** increased rice sensitivity and led to more accumulation of ATZ and ACT, whereas transgenic rice overexpressing **OsBR6ox** lines (OEs) showed opposite effects with improved growth and lower ATZ and ACT accumulation in various tissues, including grains.
   - **OsBR6ox** was transcriptionally induced under ATZ and ACT stress.
   - Such an epigenetic modification marker was responsible for the increased **OsBR6ox** expression and consequent detoxification of ATZ/ACT in rice and environment.
