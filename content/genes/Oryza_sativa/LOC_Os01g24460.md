## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g24460](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g24460)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsNF-YC10</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - qRT-PCR and mRNA in situ hybridization analysis revealed that **OsNF-YC10** was highly expressed in endosperm and spikelet hull at late developmental stages.
   - Cytological experiments revealed significantly reduced cell number of spikelet hull in **OsNF-YC10** lines compared with that in WT.
   - Taken together, it is suggested that **OsNF-YC10** regulates the grains size and shape by influencing the cell proliferation of spikelet hulls.
   - These results indicated that **OsNF-YC10** plays an important role in determining grain size and shape.
   - **OsNF-YC10** was further revealed to influence the expression of GW8 (a positive regulator of grain width), GW7 (a negative regulator of grain width) and cell cycle-regulated genes CYCD4, CYCA2.
   - The results showed that **OsNF-YC10** was a nuclear protein showing transcription activation activity.
