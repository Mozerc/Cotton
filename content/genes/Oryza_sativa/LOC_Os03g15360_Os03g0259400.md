## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g15360](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g15360)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0259400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0259400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** LAR
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The genes encoding **LAR** were expressed in developing fruit, particu**LAR**ly in seeds, but had low expression in leaves.
   - The two **LAR** genes had different patterns of expression in skin and seeds.
   - During grape ripening, PA levels decreased in both skin and seeds, and expression of genes encoding ANR and **LAR** were no longer detected.
   - We measured PA content and expression of genes encoding ANR, **LAR**, and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase in grape berries during development and in grapevine leaves, which accumulated PA throughout leaf expansion.
