## Functional Descriptions:
   - The present work indicated that **FLO22** plays an important role in endosperm development and plant growth by participating in nad1 maturation and multi-site editing of mitochondrial mRNA.
   - RNA-seq analysis showed that expression levels of many genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism were significantly down-regulated in the **FLO22** mutant compared with the wild type, whereas genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were significantly up-regulated.
   - Map-based cloning and complementation tests demonstrated that **FLO22** encodes a mitochondrion-localized P-type PPR protein.
   - In addition to involving in splicing as a P-type PPR protein, we found that **FLO22** interacted with DYW3, a DYW-type PPR protein, and they may function synergistically in mitochondrial RNA editing.
