## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that **DTH2** likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding.
   - We show that **DTH2** encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1.
   - Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in **DTH2** that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia.
   - In the present study, we investigated the functional roles of **OsCOL9** in blast resistance.
   - Taken together, these results indicated that the COL protein **OsCOL9** interacted with OsRACK1, and it enhanced the rice blast resistance through SA and ET signaling pathways.
   - **OsCOL9** was a critical regulator of pathogen-related genes, especially PR1b, which were also activated by exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylicacid (ACC), the precursor of ethylene (ET).
   - In a previous transcriptome analysis of early response genes in rice during Magnaporthe oryzae infection, we identified a CONSTANS-like (COL) gene **OsCOL9**.
   - Magnaporthe oryzae infection induced **OsCOL9** expression, and transgenic **OsCOL9** knock-out rice plants showed increased pathogen susceptibility.
   - **OsCOL9** was found in the nucleus of rice cells, and it exerted transcriptional activation activities through its middle region (MR).
   - Further analysis indicated that **OsCOL9** over-expression increased the expressions of phytohormone biosynthetic genes, NPR1, WRKY45, OsACO1 and OsACS1, which were related to SA and ET biosynthesis.
   - Interestingly, we found that **OsCOL9** physically interacted with the scaffold protein OsRACK1 through its CCT domain, and the OsRACK1 expression was induced in response to exogenous SA and ACC as well as M.
   - We have previously identified that the COL family member **OsCOL9** can positively enhance the rice blast resistance.
   - In addition, **OsCOL9** served as a potential yield gene, and its deficiency reduced the grain number of main panicle in plants.
   - **OsCOL9** expression exhibited two types of circadian patterns under different daylight conditions, and it could delay the heading date by suppressing the Ehd1 photoperiodic flowering pathway.
   - Our data showed that overexpression of **OsCOL9** delayed the flowering time under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions, leading to suppressed expressions of EHd1, RFT and Hd3a at the mRNA Level.
   - Taken together, our results revealed that **OsCOL9** could delay the flowering time in rice by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.
