## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g08180](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g08180)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0182300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0182300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** SPL36
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Physiological and biochemical experiments indicated that more cell death occurred in **SPL36** than the wild type and that plant growth and development were affected in this mutant.
   - **SPL36** displayed spontaneous cell death and enhanced resistance to rice bacterial pathogens.
   - These findings suggest that **SPL36** regulates the disease resistance response in rice by affecting the expression of defense- and stress-related genes.
   - Gene expression analysis suggested that **SPL36** functions in the disease response by upregulating the expression of defense-related genes.
   - **SPL36** Encodes a Receptor-like Protein Kinase that Regulates Programmed Cell Death and Defense Responses in Rice.
   - We isolated **SPL36** by map-based cloning.
   - **SPL36** was more sensitive to salt stress than the wild type, suggesting that **SPL36** also negatively regulates the salt-stress response.
   - **SPL36** is predicted to encode a receptor-like protein kinase containing leucine-rich domains that may be involved in stress responses in rice.
