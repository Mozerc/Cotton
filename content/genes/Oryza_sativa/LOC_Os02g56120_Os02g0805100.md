## Functional Descriptions:
   - Constitutive Expression of **OsIAA9** Affects Starch Granules Accumulation and Root Gravitropic Response in Arabidopsis..
   - Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing **OsIAA9** have increased number of lateral roots, and reduced gravitropic response.
   - Taken together, our study showed that **OsIAA9** is a transcriptional repressor, and it regulates gravitropic response when expressed in Arabidopsis by regulating granules accumulation and distribution in root tips.
   - Further analysis showed that **OsIAA9** transgenic Arabidopsis plants accumulated fewer granules in their root tips and the distribution of granules was also affected.
   - RT-PCR results showed that expression of **OsIAA9** was induced by exogenously applied auxin, suggesting that **OsIAA9** is an auxin response gene.
   - When transfected into protoplasts isolated from rosette leaves of Arabidopsis, **OsIAA9** repressed reporter gene expression, and the repression was partially released by exogenously IAA.
   - By generating transgenic plants expressing GFP-**OsIAA9** and examining florescence in the transgenic plants, we found that **OsIAA9** is localized in the nucleus.
   - Bioinformatic analysis showed that **OsIAA9** has a repressor motif in Domain I, a degron in Domain II, and the conserved amino acid signatures for protein-protein interactions in Domain III and Domain IV.
