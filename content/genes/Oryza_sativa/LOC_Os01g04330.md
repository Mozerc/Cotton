## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of OsERF48 causes regulation of **OsCML16**, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
   - Our results demonstrated that OsERF48 regulates **OsCML16**, a calmodulin-like protein gene that enhances root growth and drought tolerance.
   - Furthermore, Ca2+ and TFP, a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist, were involved in the ABA-induced transcription of **OsCML16** and its target genes, and they were also obviously induced by cold, drought, and salt stresses.
   - Identification of novel **OsCML16** target proteins and differential expression analysis under abiotic stresses in rice.
   - Taken together, our new findings have provided the basis for the novel signaling pathways of **OsCML16** in the abiotic stress response in rice.
