## Functional Descriptions:
   - The auxin-inducible homeobox gene **OsHox1** of rice (Oryza sativa) is a positive regulator of procambial cell fate commitment, and its overexpression reduces the sensitivity of polar auxin transport (PAT) to the PAT inhibitor 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA).
   - Finally, we show that in the absence of any overt phenotypical change, **OsHox1** overexpression specifically reduces the affinity of the NPA-binding protein toward NPA and enhances PAT and its sensitivity toward auxin.
   - These results are consistent with the hypothesis that **OsHox1** promotes fate commitment of procambial cells by increasing their auxin conductivity properties and stabilizing this state against modulations of PAT by an endogenous NPA-like molecule.
   - The procambium specification gene **OsHox1** promotes polar auxin transport capacity and reduces its sensitivity toward inhibition.
   - **OsHox1** mRNA could be detected in various rice tissues at different developmental stages, with highest levels in embryos, shoots of seedlings, and leaves of mature plants.
   - Transgenic expression of **OsHox1** in Arabidopsis retarded growth and affected leaf size and shape, indicative of a role as developmental regulator.
   - The rice protein **OsHox1** is a member of the homeodomain leucine zipper family of transcription factors.
   - **OsHox1** represents the first example of a transcription factor whose function can be linked to specification events mediating provascular cell fate commitment.
   - This paper describes the characterization of **OsHox1**, a cDNA clone from rice encoding a member of the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) class of putative transcription factors.
   - In vitro and in vivo DNA-binding studies revealed that **OsHox1** interacts with the pseudopalindromic sequence CAAT(C/G)ATTG, confirming that the protein represents a transcription factor.
   - In this study, two class II homeodomain-Leu zipper genes, **OsHox1** and OsHOX28, were identified as positive regulators of tiller angle by affecting shoot gravitropism.
   - In contrast to HSFA2D and LA1, **OsHox1** and OsHOX28 attenuated lateral auxin transport, thus repressing the expression of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 6 (WOX6) and WOX11 in the lower side of the shoot base of plants subjected to gravistimulation.
   - **OsHox1** and OsHOX28 Redundantly Shape Rice Tiller Angle by Reducing HSFA2D Expression and Auxin Content.
   - Genetic analysis further confirmed that **OsHox1** and OsHOX28 act upstream of HSFA2D Additionally, both **OsHox1** and OsHOX28 inhibit the expression of multiple OsYUCCA genes and decrease auxin biosynthesis.
   - Taken together, these results demonstrated that **OsHox1** and OsHOX28 regulate the local distribution of auxin, and thus tiller angle establishment, through suppression of the HSFA2D-LA1 pathway and reduction of endogenous auxin content.
