## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MID1** was primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues, with low level in the tapetum, and was induced by drought and other abiotic stresses.
   - Our findings suggest that **MID1** is a transcriptional regulator that promotes rice male development under drought by modulating the expressions of drought-related and anther developmental genes and provide valuable information for crop improvement.
   - **MID1** Plays an Important Role in Response to Drought Stress during Reproductive Development..
   - We show here that **MID1** (MYB Important for Drought Response1), encoding a putative R-R-type MYB-like transcription factor, can improve rice yield under drought.
   - **MID1** was localized to the nucleus and could activate gene expression in yeast, and its homologs were identified in many other plants with high levels sequence similarity.
   - Here, we show that the rice R2R3 MYB transcription factor **OsARM1** (ARSENITE-RESPONSIVE MYB1) regulates As-associated transporters genes.
   - Our findings suggest that the **OsARM1** transcription factor has essential functions in regulating As uptake and root-to-shoot translocation in rice.
   - Histochemical analysis of **OsARM1**pro::GUS lines indicated that **OsARM1** was expressed in the phloem of vascular bundles in basal and upper nodes.
   - Knockout of **OsARM1** (**OsARM1**-KO CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutants) improved tolerance to As(III) and overexpression of **OsARM1** (**OsARM1**-OE lines) increased sensitivity to As(III).
   - Treatment with As(III) induced **OsARM1** transcript accumulation and an **OsARM1**-GFP fusion localized to the nucleus.
   - In particular, the As(III) levels in node I were significantly higher in **OsARM1**-KOs, but significantly lower in **OsARM1**-OEs, compared to wild-type plants, implying that **OsARM1** is important for the regulation of root-to-shoot translocation of As.
