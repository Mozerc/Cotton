## Functional Descriptions:
   - For **OsHKT1;4**, alternative splicing of transcript and the anatomical complexity of the sheath needed to be taken into account.
   - Thus, Na(+) accumulation in a specific leaf blade seems to be regulated by abundance of a correctly spliced **OsHKT1;4** transcript in a corresponding sheath.
   - The level of **OsHKT1;4** transcripts was prominent in leaf sheaths throughout the growth stages.
   - Taken together, our results indicate a newly recognized function of **OsHKT1;4** in Na(+) exclusion in stems together with leaf sheaths, thus excluding Na(+) from leaf blades of a japonica rice cultivar in the reproductive growth stage, but the contribution is low when the plants are in the vegetative growth stage.
   - In addition, (22)Na(+) tracer experiments using peduncles of RNAi and WT plants suggested xylem Na(+) unloading by **OsHKT1;4**.
   - Unexpectedly however, we demonstrate here accumulation of **OsHKT1;4** transcripts in the stem including internode II and peduncle in the reproductive growth stage.
   - Moreover, phenotypic analysis of **OsHKT1;4** RNAi plants in the vegetative growth stage revealed no profound influence on the growth and ion accumulation in comparison with WT plants upon salinity stress.
   - Here, we report results of the functional characterization of the **OsHKT1;4** transporter in rice.
   - T-DNA Tagging-Based Gain-of-Function of **OsHKT1;4** Reinforces Na Exclusion from Leaves and Stems but Triggers Na Toxicity in Roots of Rice Under Salt Stress.
   - Here, we have characterized a transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutant line of rice, which overexpresses **OsHKT1;4**, owing to enhancer elements in the T-DNA, to gain an insight into the impact of **OsHKT1;4** on salt tolerance of rice.
   - We observed that progressive desalinization of the xylem sap along its ascent to the leaf blades still occurred in plants grown at submillimolar Na+ concentration, and that **OsHKT1;4** was involved in reducing xylem sap Na+ concentration in roots in these conditions too.
   - Constitutive Contribution by the Rice **OsHKT1;4** Na + Transporter to Xylem Sap Desalinization and Low Na + Accumulation in Young Leaves Under Low as High External Na + Conditions.
   - By analyzing transgenic rice plants expressing a GUS reporter gene construct, we observed that **OsHKT1;4** is mainly expressed in xylem parenchyma in both roots and leaves.
   - Using mutant lines expressing artificial microRNA that selectively reduced **OsHKT1;4** expression, the involvement of **OsHKT1;4** in retrieving Na+ from the xylem sap in the roots upon salt stress was evidenced.
   - Three rice HKT genes, OsHKT1;1, **OsHKT1;4** and OsHKT1;5, are known to contribute to salt tolerance by reducing Na+ accumulation in shoots upon salt stress.
   - Since **OsHKT1;4** was found to be also well expressed in the roots in absence of salt stress, we extended the analysis of its role when plants were subjected to non-toxic Na+ conditions (0.
   - Here, we further investigate the mechanisms by which **OsHKT1;4** contributes to this process and extend this analysis to the role of this transporter in plants in presence of low Na+ concentrations.
