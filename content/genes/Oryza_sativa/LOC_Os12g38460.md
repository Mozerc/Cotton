- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression analyses of several cell-cycle markers revealed that, in **MEL2** mutant anthers, most germ cells failed to enter premeiotic S-phase and meiosis, and a part escaped from the defect and underwent meiosis with a significant delay or continued mitotic cycles.
   - Taken together with transcriptome and gene ontology results, we propose that the rice **MEL2** is involved in the translational regulation of key meiotic genes on 3'-UTRs to achieve the faithful transition of germ cells to meiosis.
   - Of 249 genes that conserved the consensus in their 3'-UTR, 13 genes spatiotemporally co-expressed with **MEL2** in meiotic flowers, and included several genes whose function was supposed in meiosis; such as Replication protein A and OsMADS3.
