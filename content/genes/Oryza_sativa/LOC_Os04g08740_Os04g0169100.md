## Functional Descriptions:
   - The effective panicles and seed-setting rate were reduced in the **ETR2**-overexpressing plants, while thousand-seed weight was substantially enhanced in both the **ETR2**-RNAi plants and the **ETR2** mutant compared with controls.
   - Here, we characterized a subfamily II ethylene receptor, ETHYLENE RESPONSE2 (**ETR2**), in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Overexpression of **ETR2** in transgenic rice plants reduced ethylene sensitivity and delayed floral transition.
   - Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) plants exhibited early flowering and the **ETR2** T-DNA insertion mutant **ETR2** showed enhanced ethylene sensitivity and early flowering.
   - The ethylene receptor **ETR2** delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice.
   - Cloning of a cDNA encoding an ETR2-like protein (**Os-ERL1**) from deep water rice (Oryza sativa L.) and increase in its mRNA level by submergence, ethylene, and gibberellin treatments.
   - The GIGANTEA and TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog (RCN1) that cause delayed flowering were upregulated in **ETR2**-overexpressing plants but downregulated in the **ETR2** mutant.
   - Thus, **ETR2** may delay flowering and cause starch accumulation in stems by regulating downstream genes.
   - Furthermore, the expression of two genes for ethylene signal transduction, **ETR2** and EIN3, increased in these RNAi transgenic plants, whereas the expression of ERF3 was suppressed.
   - A cDNA from deep water rice treated with ethylene, encoding an ethylene receptor homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana **ETR2** and EIN4, was isolated using differential display and RACE techniques.
   - The cDNA (2880 bp), corresponding to the **Os-ERL1** gene (Oryza sativa ETHYLENE RESPONSE 2 like 1; GenBank accession number AB107219), contained an open reading frame of 2289 bp coding for 763 amino acids.
   - The **Os-ERL1** gene was up-regulated by flooding, and by treatment with ethylene and gibberellin.
   - Starch granules accumulated in the internodes of the **ETR2**-overexpressing plants, but not in the **ETR2** mutant.
   - Furthermore, instead of the constitutive expression profile of OsERS1, **OsETR2** is differentially expressed in seedlings of light/dark-grown conditions, submergence or exogenous ethylene treatments.
   - Our results and others support the notion that OsERS1 and **OsETR2** could have different roles during rice plant submergence.
   - The Differentiated Localized Rice Ethylene Receptors OsERS1 and **OsETR2** and their Potential Role during Submergence..
   - OsERS1 and **OsETR2** are major ethylene receptors in rice that have been reported to have different regulatory functions.
   - Base on the results, we suggested that OsERS1 could be localized to plasma membranes, whereas **OsETR2** could be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.
