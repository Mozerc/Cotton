## Functional Descriptions:
   - The overexpression leads to a range of novel phenotypes, involving increased growth rate and altered plant architecture, suggesting that **OsHDAC1** functions in the genome-wide programming of gene expression.
   - Structure and expression of the rice class-I type histone deacetylase genes**OsHDAC1**-3:**OsHDAC1**overexpression in transgenic plants leads to increased growth rate and altered architecture.
   - We have previously isolated a rice gene encoding a histone deacetylase, **OsHDAC1**, and observed that its transgenic overexpression increases seedling root growth.
   - To identify the transcriptional repression events that occur as a result of **OsHDAC1** overexpression (**OsHDAC1**(OE)), a global profiling of root-expressed genes was performed on **OsHDAC1**(OE) or HDAC inhibitor-treated non-transgenic (NT) roots, in comparison with untreated NT roots.
   - We selected 39 genes that are induced and repressed in HDAC inhibitor-treated NT and **OsHDAC1**(OE) roots, compared with NT roots, respectively.
   - The root phenotype of OsNAC6 knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the **OsHDAC1**(OE) seedlings.
   - Conversely, the root phenotype of the OsNAC6 overexpressors was similar to that of the **OsHDAC1** knock-out seedlings.
   - These observations indicate that **OsHDAC1** negatively regulates the OsNAC6 gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the **OsHDAC1**(OE) seedlings.
   - The histone deacetylase **OsHDAC1** epigenetically regulates theOsNAC6gene that controls seedling root growth in rice.
   - **OsHDAC1** was expressed at similar levels in the leaves, roots, and callus cells, whereas OsHDAC2 and 3 were expressed in the roots and callus cells, but not in the leaves, exhibiting distinct tissue specificity.
   - Rice **OsHDAC1** RNAi plants produced fewer lateral roots than wild-type plants, whereas plants overexpressing **OsHDAC1** exhibited increased lateral root proliferation by promoting LR primordia formation.
   - Our findings suggest that **OsHDAC1** is a breeding target in rice that can improve resource capture.
