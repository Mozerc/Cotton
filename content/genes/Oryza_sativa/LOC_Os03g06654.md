## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, a lower turgor potential and transpiration rate in their mature leaves indicates that **OsCOW1** plants are water-deficient, due to insufficient water uptake that possibly stems from that diminished root to shoot ratio.
   - Our results demonstrated that IAA biosynthesis regulated by **OsFMO**(t) is likely localized and might play an essential role in shaping local IAA concentrations which, in turn, is critical for regulating normal growth and development in rice.
   - In this study, the full-length genomic DNA and cDNA of **OsFMO**(t), a FMO gene that was originally identified from a rolled-leaf mutant in rice, was isolated and cloned from wild type of the rolled-leaf mutant.
   - Spatio-temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR and histochemical analysis for GUS activity revealed that expression of **OsFMO**(t) was totally absent in the rolled-leaf mutant.
   - Homozygous plants with either a Tos17 or T-DNA-inserted allele of **OsCOW1** exhibit phenotypes of rolled leaves, reduced leaf widths, and lower root to shoot ratios.
   - When **OsCOW1** seedlings are grown under low-intensity light and high relative humidity, the rolled-leaf phenotype is greatly alleviated.
   - Overexpression of **OsFMO**(t) in transformed rice calli produced IAA-excessive phenotypes that showed browning and lethal effects when exogenous auxins such as naphthylacetic acid (NAA) were added to the medium.
   - These results suggested that the **OsFMO**(t) protein is involved in IAA biosynthesis in rice and its overexpression could lead to the malformation of calli.
   - Thus, our observations suggest that **OsCOW1**-mediated IAA biosynthesis plays an important role in maintaining root to shoot ratios and, in turn, affects water homeostasis in rice.
   - In this paper, we examined the function of four genes that regulate the width of the leaf blade and the vein number: NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), NAL2, NAL3 and **NAL7**.
   - In contrast, the **NAL7** mutation showed a milder effect on leaf width and vein number, and both the large and small veins were similarly affected.
   - The **NAL7** mutation showed additive effects on both leaf width and vein number, when combined with the nal1 single or the nal2 nal3 double mutation.
   - In addition, observations of inner tissues revealed that cell differentiation was partially compromised in the nal2 nal3 **NAL7** mutant, consistent with the severe reduction in leaf width in this triple mutant.
   - The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and **NAL7** is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant.
   - Soil compaction-induced ethylene also up-regulates the auxin biosynthesis gene **OsYUC8**.
