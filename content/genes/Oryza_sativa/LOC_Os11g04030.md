## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os11g04030](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os11g04030)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os11g0135000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os11g0135000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TOM2</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In onion epidermal and rice root cells, the **TOM2**-GFP fusion protein localized to the cell membrane, indicating that the **TOM2** protein is a transporter for phytosiderophore efflux to the cell exterior.
   - Transgenic rice in which **TOM2** expression was repressed by RNA interference showed growth defects compared to non-transformants and TOM3-repressed rice.
   - Our results indicate that **TOM2** is involved in the internal transport of DMA, which is required for normal plant growth.
   - Strong **TOM2** expression was observed in developing tissues during seed maturation and germination, while TOM3 expression was weak during seed maturation.
   - The phytosiderophore efflux transporter **TOM2** is involved in metal transport in rice.
   - In the present study, we analyzed **TOM2** and TOM3, rice homologs of transporter of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores 1 (TOM1), a crucial efflux transporter directly involved in phytosiderophore secretion into the soil.
