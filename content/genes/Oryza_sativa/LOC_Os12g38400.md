- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The R2R3-type MYB gene **OsMYB91** has a function in coordinating plant growth and salt stress tolerance in rice.
   - Plants over-expressing **OsMYB91** showed reduced plant growth and accumulation of endogenous ABA under control conditions.
   - These results suggested that **OsMYB91** was a stress-responsive gene that might be involved in coordinating rice tolerance to abiotic stress and plant growth by regulating SLR1 expression.
   - **OsMYB91** was induced by abiotic stress, especially by salt stress.
   - In addition, expression of **OsMYB91** was also induced by other abiotic stresses and hormone treatment.
