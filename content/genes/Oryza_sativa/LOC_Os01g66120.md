## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results imply that **OsNAC6**, besides having a role in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses, also integrates signals derived from both abiotic and biotic stresses.
   - Transgenic rice plants over-expressing **OsNAC6** constitutively exhibited growth retardation and low reproductive yields.
   - The root phenotype of **OsNAC6** knock-out seedlings was observed to be similar to that of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings.
   - Conversely, the root phenotype of the **OsNAC6** overexpressors was similar to that of the OsHDAC1 knock-out seedlings.
   - These observations indicate that OsHDAC1 negatively regulates the **OsNAC6** gene that primarily mediates the alteration in the root growth of the OsHDAC1(OE) seedlings.
   - The histone deacetylase OsHDAC1 epigenetically regulates the**OsNAC6**gene that controls seedling root growth in rice.
   - **OsNAC6** was also induced by jasmonic acid (JA), a plant hormone that activates defense responses against herbivores and pathogens.
   - Expression of **OsNAC6** is induced by abiotic stresses, including cold, drought and high salinity.
   - The growth of these plants was similar to that of control plants, whereas the growth of **OsNAC6**-overexpressing transgenic plants was retarded.
   - Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and **OsNAC6** are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as OsLEA3, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different.
   - These data suggest **SNAC2** is a novel stress responsive NAC transcription factor that possesses potential utility in improving stress tolerance of rice.
   - Characterization of transcription factor gene **SNAC2** conferring cold and salt tolerance in rice.
   - Northern blot and **SNAC2** promoter activity analyses suggest that **SNAC2** gene was induced by drought, salinity, cold, wounding, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
   - Here we show that **OsNAC6** is induced by cold, salt, drought and abscisic acid (ABA).
   - By utilizing stress-inducible promoters, such as the **OsNAC6** promoter, it is hoped that stress-inducible over-expression of **OsNAC6** in rice can improve stress tolerance by suppressing the negative effects of **OsNAC6** on growth under normal growth conditions.
   - **OsNAC6** gene expression is also induced by wounding and blast disease.
   - The **OsNAC6** gene is a member of the NAC transcription factor gene family in rice.
   - Functional analysis of a NAC-type transcription factor **OsNAC6** involved in abiotic and biotic stress-responsive gene expression in rice.
   - The results of microarray analysis revealed that many genes that are inducible by abiotic and biotic stresses were upregulated in rice plants over-expressing **OsNAC6**.
   - Collectively, these results indicate that **OsNAC6** functions as a transcriptional activator in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants.
   - The rice **OsNAC6** transcription factor orchestrates multiple molecular mechanisms involving root structural adaptions and nicotianamine biosynthesis for drought tolerance.
   - Multiyear drought field tests demonstrated that the grain yield of **OsNAC6** root-specific overexpressing transgenic rice lines was less affected by drought stress than were non-transgenic controls.
   - Collectively, **OsNAC6** orchestrates novel molecular drought tolerance mechanisms and has potential for the biotechnological development of high-yielding crops under water limiting conditions.
   - Genome-wide analyses of loss- and gain-of-function mutants revealed that **OsNAC6** up-regulates the expression of direct target genes involved in membrane modification, nicotianamine (NA) biosynthesis, glutathione relocation, 3'-phophoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate accumulation, and glycosylation, which represent multiple drought tolerance pathways.
