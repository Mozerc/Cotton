## Functional Descriptions:
   - Consistent with its involvement in leaf senescence, **RLS1** was up-regulated during dark-induced leaf senescence and down-regulated by cytokinin.
   - In this study, the genetic and physiological characteristics of the rice **RLS1** (rapid leaf senescence 1) mutant were identified.
   - The rapid loss of chlorophyll content during senescence was the main cause of accelerated leaf senescence in **RLS1**.
   - Intriguingly, constitutive expression of **RLS1** also slightly accelerated leaf senescence with decreased chlorophyll content in transgenic rice plants.
   - A novel protein **RLS1** with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice.
   - The **RLS1** mutant developed small, yellow-brown lesions resembling disease scattered over the whole surfaces of leaves that displayed earlier senescence than those of wild-type plants.
   - Microscopic observation indicated that PCD was misregulated, probably resulting in the accelerated degradation of chloroplasts in **RLS1** leaves.
   - A screen for suppressors of **RLS1** activation identified RMC (Root Meander Curling) as essential for the **RLS1**-activated defense response.
   - An activated form of NB-ARC protein **RLS1** functions with cysteine-rich receptor-like protein RMC to trigger cell death in rice.
