- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsBISAMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **OsBISAMT1** in rice leaves was induced by treatments with benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, which are capable of inducing rice disease resistance.
   - The results suggest that **OsBISAMT1** may be involved in disease resistance responses as well as in wound response in rice.
   - **OsBISAMT1**, a gene encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine: salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase, is differentially expressed in rice defense responses.
   - **OsBISAMT1** was also up-regulated in both incompatible and compatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grsiea, but the induced expression of **OsBISAMT1** was greater and more rapid in the incompatible interaction than that in the compatible one.
