- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Light and near-infrared confocal microscopy of cross-sections through developing flowers of male-sterile transgenics shows that tissue-specific expression of barnase or the antisense **RTS** genes interrupts tapetal development, resulting in deformed non-viable pollen.
   - These results demonstrate a critical role of the **RTS** gene in pollen development in rice and the versatile application of the **RTS** gene promoter in directing anther-specific gene expression in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, pointing to a potential for exploiting this gene and its promoter for engineering male sterility for hybrid production of various plant species.
   - A tapetum-specific gene, **RTS**, has been isolated by differential screening of a cDNA library from rice panicles.
   - Transgenic and antisense RNA approaches revealed that **RTS** gene is required for male fertility in rice.
   - **RTS**, a rice anther-specific gene is required for male fertility and its promoter sequence directs tissue-specific gene expression in different plant species.
   - Several other sequence motifs found in other anther-specific promoters were also identified in the promoter of the **RTS** gene.
