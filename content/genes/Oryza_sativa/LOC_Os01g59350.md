## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsTGA2** confers disease resistance to rice against leaf blight by regulating expression levels of disease related genes via interaction with NH1.
   - Here, we examined biological roles of **OsTGA2** (grouped into the same subclade as Arabidopsis TGAs) in bacterial leaf blight resistance.
   - Overexpression of **OsTGA2** increased resistance of rice to bacterial leaf blight, although overexpression of OsTGA3 resulted in disease symptoms similar to wild type plant upon Xoo infection.
   - These results suggest that **OsTGA2** can directly regulate the expression of defense related genes and increase the resistance of rice against bacterial leaf blight disease.
   - Overexpression of **OsTGA2** enhanced the expression of defense related genes containing TGA binding cis-element in the promoter such as AP2/EREBP 129, ERD1, and HOP1.
   - Transcriptional level of **OsTGA2** was accumulated after treatment with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and Xathomonas oryzae pv.
   - Results of quadruple 9-mer protein-binding microarray analysis indicated that **OsTGA2** could bind to TGACGT DNA sequence.
   - **OsTGAL1** suppresses the resistance of rice to bacterial blight disease by regulating the expression of salicylic acid glucosyltransferase OsSGT1.
   - OsSGT1 knockout lines had enhanced resistance to Xoo, and knocking out OsSGT1 in plants overexpressing **OsTGAL1** blocked the susceptibility caused by **OsTGAL1**.
   - Thus, our results demonstrate that **OsTGAL1** negatively regulates resistance to Xoo by its effects on SA metabolism via the activation of OsSGT1, which provides valuable targets for plant breeders in developing new cultivars that are resistant to Xoo.
   - Overexpression of **OsTGAL1** increased the susceptibility of rice to Xoo.
   - The transcript of OsSGT1 was induced by Xoo and this responsive expression was further increased in plants overexpressing **OsTGAL1**.
   - Plants overexpressing **OsTGAL1** could affect the expression of many SA signaling-related genes.
   - **OsTGAL1** was able to interact with the promoter of OsSGT1, which encodes a key enzyme for SA metabolism.
