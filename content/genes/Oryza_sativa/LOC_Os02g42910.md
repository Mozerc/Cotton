- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsSHOC1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results suggest that **OsSHOC1** and OsPTD1 are essential for rice fertilization and CO formation, possibly by stabilizing the recombinant intermediates during meiosis.
   - **OsSHOC1** was sterile both in male and female gametophytes, and it showed a striking reduction in the number of meiotic COs, indicating that **OsSHOC1** was required for normal CO formation.
   - Further investigations showed that **OsSHOC1** physically interacted with OsPTD1 and that the latter was also required for normal CO formation and plant fertility.
   - **OsSHOC1** and OsPTD1 are essential for crossover formation during rice meiosis.
