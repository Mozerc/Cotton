## Functional Descriptions:
   - A 22-bp deletion in **OsPLS3** gene encoding a DUF266-containing protein is implicated in rice leaf senescence.
   - **OsPLS3** regulates the onset of leaf senescence in rice.
   - Through map-based cloning strategy, we determined that 22-bp deletion in the **OsPLS3** gene encoding a domain of unknown function 266 (DUF266)-containing protein, a member of GT14-like, underlies the premature leaf senescence phenotype in the **OsPLS3** mutant.
   - The **OsPLS3** mRNA levels progressively declined with the age-dependent leaf senescence in wild-type rice, implying a negative role of **OsPLS3** in regulating leaf senescence.
   - Our results indicated that the DUF266-containing gene **OsPLS3** plays an important role in the onset of leaf senescence, in part through cytokinin and ethylene signaling in rice.
   - Key message The **OsPLS3** locus was isolated by map-based cloning that encodes a DUF266-containing protein.
   - Physiological analysis, and histochemical staining and transmission electron microscopy assays indicated that the **OsPLS3** mutant accumulated higher levels of ethylene and reactive oxygen species than its wild type.
   - Compared to the wild type IR64, the spotted-leaf mutant spl21 exhibited loss of chlorophyll, breakdown of chloroplasts, down-regulation of photosynthesis-related genes, and up-regulation  of senescence associated genes, which indicated that **OsGCNT** regulates premature leaf senescence.
   - High throughput RNA sequencing analysis provided further evidence for the biological effects of loss of **OsGCNT** function on cell death, premature leaf senescence and enhanced disease resistance in rice.
   - Thus, we demonstrated that the novel **OsGCNT** regulated rice innate immunity and immunity-associated leaf senescence probably by changing the jasmonate metabolic  pathway.
   - Functional inactivation of **OsGCNT** induces enhanced disease resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae in rice.
   - oryzae, up-regulation of pathogenesis-related genes and increased level of jasmonate which suggested that **OsGCNT** is a negative  regulator of defense response in rice.
