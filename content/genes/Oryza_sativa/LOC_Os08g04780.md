## Functional Descriptions:
   - Compared with those in Koshihikari, the expression levels of the flowering-time genes Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice flowering locus T1 (RFT1) were lower in a near-isogenic line with the Hayamasari **Hd18** allele in a Koshihikari genetic background.
   - The difference in flowering time between the Japanese rice cultivars Koshihikari and Hayamasari was due to a single-nucleotide polymorphism within the **Hd18** gene, which encodes an amine oxidase domain-containing protein and is homologous to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD).
   - The Hayamasari **Hd18** allele and knockdown of **Hd18** gene expression delayed the flowering time of rice plants regardless of the day-length condition.
   - We revealed that **Hd18** acts as an accelerator in the rice-flowering pathway under both short- and long-day conditions by elevating transcription levels of Ehd1 Gene expression analysis also suggested the involvement of MADS-box genes such as OsMADS50, OsMADS51, and OsMADS56 in the **Hd18**-associated regulation of Ehd1 These results suggest that, like FLD, its rice homolog accelerates flowering time but is involved in rice flowering pathways that differ from the autonomous pathways in Arabidopsis.
