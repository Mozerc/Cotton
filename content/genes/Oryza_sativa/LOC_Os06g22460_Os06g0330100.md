## Functional Descriptions:
   - ) blast resistance allele of Pid3, designated **Pi25**, from a stable blast resistance cultivar Gumei2.
   - Over-expression analysis and complementation test showed that **Pi25** conferred blast resistance to M.
   - Although the mechanism of **Pi25**/Pid3-mediated resistance needs to be further investigated, the isolation of the allele would facilitate the utilization of **Pi25**/Pid3 in rice blast resistance breeding program via transgenic approach and marker assisted selection.
   - Through this approach, we identified a new blast resistance gene, **Pid3**, in the indica variety, Digu.
   - Identification of a new rice blast resistance gene, **Pid3**, by genomewide comparison of paired nucleotide-binding site--leucine-rich repeat genes and their pseudogene alleles between the two sequenced rice genomes.
   - The gene cluster was located to chromosome 6 and includes two genes mapped previously, **Pi25**(t), against Chinese rice blast isolate 92-183 (race ZC15) and Pi26(t) against Philippine rice blast isolate Ca89 (lineage 4), and a gene for resistance against Philippine rice blast isolate 92330-5 (lineage 17).
   - **Pi25**( t) conferred resistance to both leaf and neck blast, and its resistance allele was from Gumei 2.
   - In a natural infection test in a blast hot-spot, **Pi25**(t) exhibited high resistance to neck blast, while Pi24(t) showed little effect.
   - A **Pid3** allele from rice cultivar Gumei2 confers resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae.
   - Allelic variation of the rice blast resistance gene **Pid3** in cultivated rice worldwide..
   - In this study, the re-sequencing data from 3,000 rice genomes project (3â€‰K RGP) was used to analyze the allelic variation at the rice blast resistance (R) **Pid3** locus.
   - **Pid3** alleles in most japonica rice accessions were pseudogenes due to premature stop mutations, while those in most indica rice accessions were identical to the functional haplotype Hap_6, which had a similar resistance spectrum as the previously reported **Pid3** gene.
   - By sequencing and CAPS marker analyzing the **Pid3** alleles in widespread cultivars in China, we verified that Hap_6 had been widely deployed in indica rice breeding of China.
   - Thus, we suggest that the priority for utilization of the **Pid3** locus in rice breeding should be on introducing the functional **Pid3** alleles into japonica rice cultivars and the functional alleles of non-Hap_6 haplotypes into indica rice cultivars for increasing genetic diversity.
