## Functional Descriptions:
   - To allow a better understanding of the function of **OsBIHD1** in plant disease resistance response, the **OsBIHD1** gene in tobacco was overexpressed by Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation with a construct containing the **OsBIHD1** ORF under control of the 35S promoter.
   - The results suggested that the **OsBIHD1** protein may be positively involved in activating expression of the defence-related genes in disease resistance responses, and is also important in rice development and abiotic stress tolerance.
   - Northern blot analysis showed that expression of **OsBIHD1** was activated upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance.
   - Up-regulation of **OsBIHD1**, a rice gene encoding BELL homeodomain transcriptional factor, in disease resistance responses.
   - These results suggest that **OsBIHD1** is a BELL type of homeodomain transcription factor present in the nucleus, whose induction is associated with resistance response in rice.
   - Expression of **OsBIHD1** was also up-regulated rapidly during the first 6 h after inoculation with Magnaporthe grisea in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during the incompatible interaction between M.
   - Overexpression of the rice **OsBIHD1** gene in some of the transgenic tobacco lines led to some morphological abnormalities in the top buds and roots.
   - However, the transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing **OsBIHD1** showed enhanced sensitivity to salt and oxidative stress as compared with the wild-type plants.
   - Overexpression in transgenic tobacco reveals different roles for the rice homeodomain gene **OsBIHD1** in biotic and abiotic stress responses.
   - In a large-scale yeast two-hybrid screening for Pik-H4-interacting proteins, a homeodomain transcription factor **OsBIHD1** was identified, which is previously known to function in biotic and abiotic stress responses.
   - NBS-LRR Protein Pik-H4 Interacts with **OsBIHD1** to Balance Rice Blast Resistance and Growth by Coordinating Ethylene-Brassinosteroid Pathway.
   - Furthermore, **OsBIHD1** was found to be capable of binding to the sequence-specific cis-elements on the promoters of CYP734A2 to suppress the plant growth under fungal invasion.
   - Our results collectively suggest a model that **OsBIHD1** is required for Pik-H4-mediated blast resistance through modulating the trade-off between resistance and growth by coordinating brassinosteroid-ethylene pathway.
   - The knockout of **OsBIHD1** in rice lines carrying Pik-H4 largely compromised the resistance of the rice lines to Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungus that causes rice blast.
   - While overexpression of **OsBIHD1** resulted in enhanced expression of the pathogenesis-related (PR) and ethylene (ET) synthesis genes.
   - In addition, **OsBIHD1** overexpression or deficiency provoked dwarfism and reduced brassinosteroid (BR) insensitivity through repressing the expression of several critical genes involved in BR biosynthesis and BR signaling.
