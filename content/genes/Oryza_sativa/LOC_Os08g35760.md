- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsGLP1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The transgenic tobacco lines expressing SOD-active **OsGLP1** showed tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses mitigated by hyper-accumulating H(2)O(2) upon infection by fungal pathogen (Fusarium solani) and treatment to chemical oxidizing agent (ammonium persulfate), respectively.
   - Our observations on the maintenance of cell dimension, cell wall-associated localization particularly in the sub-epidermal tissues and the SOD activity of **OsGLP1** could explain its functional role in regulation of plant height and disease resistance in rice plant.
   - Usually, the single copy **OsGLP1** gene in rice plant was found to be expressed predominantly in green vegetative tissues.
   - Our recent report documented that the rice germin-like protein1 (**OsGLP1**), being a cell wall-associated protein involves in disease resistance in rice and possesses superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as recognized by heterologous expression in tobacco.
   - The transgenic rice lines showed significant reduction in endogenous **OsGLP1** expression due to 26nt siRNA-mediated gene silencing, displayed semi-dwarfism and were affected seriously by fungal diseases, compared to the untransformed plant.
   - Our findings demonstrate that the **OsGLP1** with its inherent SOD activity is responsible for hyper-accumulation of H(2)O(2) and reinforcement of the cell wall components.
