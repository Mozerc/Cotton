## Functional Descriptions:
   - Analysis of **OsAGSW1** promoter::Î²-glucuronidase transgenic rice indicated that this gene was highly expressed in vascular bundles in shoot, hull and caryopsis.
   - Thus, our results demonstrated that **OsAGSW1** plays an important role in seed shape and size of rice by regulating the number of external parenchyma cells and the development of vascular bundles, providing a new insight into the functions of ABC1 genes in plants.
   - Microscopy analysis showed that spikelet hulls just before heading were different in the **OsAGSW1**-overexpressed plants compared with wild-type and **OsAGSW1** RNAi rice.
   - Here, we report on an ABC1 protein kinase gene, **OsAGSW1** (ABC1-like kinase related to Grain size and Weight).
   - Stable transgenic lines overexpressing **OsAGSW1** exhibited a phenotype with a significant increase in grain size, grain weight, grain filling rate and 1000-grain weight compared with the wild-type and RNAi transgenic plants.
