## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression profiles of OsZIP5 and **OsZIP9** overlap in the root epidermis and respond to the local Zn status in the root.
   - The decreased Zn/Cd levels and growth retardation in the oszip5 mutant are less severe than in the **OsZIP9** mutant.
   - However, **OsZIP9** is also regulated by systemic signals of Zn status from the shoot.
   - The ZIP transporter family member **OsZIP9** contributes to root Zn uptake in rice under Zn-limited conditions.
   - Furthermore, **OsZIP9** was expressed in the exodermis and endodermis of root mature regions.
   - For plants grown in a hydroponic solution with low Zn concentration, knockout of **OsZIP9** significantly reduced plant growth, which was accompanied by decreased Zn concentrations in both the root and shoot.
   - Combined, these results indicate that **OsZIP9** localized at the root exodermis and endodermis functions as an influx transporter of Zn and contributes to Zn uptake under Zn-limited conditions in rice.
   - Expression pattern analysis showed that **OsZIP9** was mainly expressed in the roots throughout all growth stages and its expression was up-regulated by Zn-deficiency.
   - **OsZIP9** was mainly localized to the plasma membrane and showed transport activity for Zn in yeast.
   - Taken together, these results show that **OsZIP9** is an important influx transporter responsible for uptake of Zn and Co from external media into root cells.
   - **OsZIP9** knockout rice plants showed a significant reduction in growth at low Zn concentration, but could be rescued by high Zn supply.
   - Natural variation of **OsZIP9** expression level is highly associated with Zn content in milled grain among rice varieties in the germplasm collection.
   - A high activity zinc transporter **OsZIP9** mediates zinc uptake in rice.
