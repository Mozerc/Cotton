## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g07920](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g07920)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0175800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0175800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** BG1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **BG1** leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism.
   - Manipulation of **BG1** in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield.
   - In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of **BG1** results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains.
   - Moreover, **BG1** is specifically induced by auxin treatment, preferentially expresses in the vascular tissue of culms and young panicles, and encodes a novel membrane-localized protein, strongly suggesting its role in regulating auxin transport.
