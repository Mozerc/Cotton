## Functional Descriptions:
   - Metabolomics analysis revealed the accumulation of excessive amount of amino acids with high N/C ratio (Gln and Asn) and several intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in **ABC1**-1, suggesting that **ABC1** plays a critical role in regulating nitrogen assimilation and carbon-nitrogen balance.
   - ), the contribution of **OsFd-GOGAT** to rice foliar nitrogen metabolism remains little up-to-date.
   - The results in this study suggested that **OsFd-GOGAT** might participate in nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence, which provides a potential way to improve nitrogen use efficiency in rice.
   - The **SPL32** plants displayed early leaf senescence, identified by disintegration of chloroplasts as cellular evidence, dramatically decreased contents of chlorophyll, up-regulation of superoxide dismutase enzyme activity and malondialdehyde, as physiological characteristic, and both up-regulation of senescence-induced STAY GREEN gene and senescence-associated transcription factors, and down-regulation of photosynthesis-associated genes, as molecular indicators.
   - qRT-PCR analysis indicated that several genes related to nitrogen metabolism were differentially expressed in **ES7**.
   - In addition, when seedlings are grown under increasing nitrogen concentrations (NH4NO3) for 15 days, the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll were significantly lower in **ES7**.
   - Our results demonstrated that **ES7** is involved in nitrogen metabolism, effects chlorophyll synthesis, and may also associated with photorespiration, impacting leaf senescence in rice.
   - **ES7** was expressed constitutively, and the **ES7** protein was localized in chloroplast.
   - When **ES7** plants are grown under photorespiration-suppressed conditions (high CO2), the senescence phenotype and chlorophyll content are rescued.
   - The leaves of the **ES7** mutant begin to senesce at the tillering stage about 60 day after sowing, and become increasingly senescent as the plants develop at the heading stage.
