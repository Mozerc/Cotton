## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g48730](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g48730)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0686800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0686800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsRLCK241
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Under normal conditions, we did not observe any measurable discrepancies between the development and growth of WT and **OsRLCK241** transgenic plants.
   - Overexpression of **OsRLCK241** confers enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - In **OsRLCK241** transgenic plants, the overexpression of **OsRLCK241** conferred improved tolerance to salt and drought stresses.
   - **OsRLCK241** expression improved ROS detoxification by enhancing the activities of ROS scavengers as well as the accumulation of compatible osmolytes to alleviate the osmotic stress evoked by salt and drought stresses.
   - Additionally, several stress-responsive genes showed higher expression levels in **OsRLCK241** transgenic plants upon exposure to salt and drought conditions.
   - Collectively, our observations suggest that **OsRLCK241** improved salt and drought tolerance in rice is mainly due to improved ROS detoxification, increased accumulation of osmolytes, and altered expression of stress-responsive genes.
