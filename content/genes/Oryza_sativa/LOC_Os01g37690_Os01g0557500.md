- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0557500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0557500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsCAX1a
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsCAX1a** mRNA was induced in roots by high concentrations of Ca(2+).
   - These results suggest that **OsCAX1a** transports Ca(2+) into vacuoles and is involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis in cells that suffer from high concentrations of Ca(2+).
   - Furthermore, transgenic rice plants transformed with the **OsCAX1a** promoter fused to beta-glucuronidase showed reporter expression in vascular bundles, stomata, trichomes, steles, flowers, embryos and aleurone layers.
   - In the case of stomata and trichomes, transcription of **OsCAX1a** was particularly high in aged organs.
   - Following, the panicle degeneration gene **OsCAX1a** was identified in the mutant, which was involved in Ca(2+) transport.
   - Our results explained the key role of **OsCAX1a** in Ca(2+) transport and distribution and laid a foundation to further explore the genetic and molecular mechanisms of panicle degeneration in rice.
