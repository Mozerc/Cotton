## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of Rice Glutaredoxin **OsGrx_C7** and OsGrx_C2.1 Reduces Intracellular Arsenic Accumulation and Increases Tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana..
   - Gene expression analysis suggested that **OsGrx_C7** expression was induced under salt stress and ubiquitously expressed in rice including root and shoot.
   - A gain-of-function approach showed that **OsGrx_C7** may act as an important determinant in salt stress, compared with WT, and revealed higher biomass accumulation, improved root and plant growth under salt stress.
   - CC-type glutaredoxin, **OsGrx_C7** plays a crucial role in enhancing protection against salt stress in rice.
   - Gene expression analysis, silencing, and overexpression of **OsGrx_C7** gene were used to discover the role of **OsGrx_C7** in response to salt stress.
   - The silencing of **OsGrx_C7** gene leads to increased sensitivity to salt stress, indicating its importance in salt stress tolerance.
   - Under salt stress condition, **OsGrx_C7** overexpressing rice plants showed lower level of lipid peroxidation and Na+/K+ ratio, while proline accumulation, soluble sugar content and GSH/GSSG ratio was higher compared to WT.
   - Furthermore, expression analysis suggested that **OsGrx_C7** acted as positive regulator of salt tolerance by reinforcing the expression of transporters (OsHKT2;1, OsHKT1;5 and OsSOS1) engaged in Na+ homeostasis in overexpressing plants.
   - Overall our study revealed that **OsGrx_C7** emerged as a key mediator in response to salt stress in rice and could be used for engineering tolerance against salt stress in rice and other crops.
