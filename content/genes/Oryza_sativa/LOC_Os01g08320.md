## Functional Descriptions:
   - Indica) **OsIAA1** cDNA as a monocot member of the Aux/IAA gene family.
   - The predicted amino acid sequence of **OsIAA1** corresponds to a protein of ca.
   - Northern blot analysis revealed that the **OsIAA1** transcript levels decrease in the excised coleoptile segments on auxin starvation, and the level is restored when auxin is supplemented; the increase in **OsIAA1** transcript level was apparent within 15 to 30 min of auxin application.
   - Auxin-induced **OsIAA1** expression appears to be correlated with the elongation of excised coleoptile segments.
   - In light-grown rice seedlings, **OsIAA1** is preferentially expressed in roots and basal segment of the seedling, whereas in the etiolated rice seedlings, the **OsIAA1** transcripts are most abundant in the coleoptile.
   - A comparative analysis in light- and dark-grown seedling tissues indicates that the **OsIAA1** transcript levels decrease on illumination.
   - **OsIAA1**, an Aux/IAA cDNA from Rice, and Changes in Its Expression as Influenced by Auxin and Light.
   - In addition, the **OsIAA1**-overexpression transgenic plants showed distinctive morphological changes such as decreased plant height and loose plant architecture.
   - T-DNA insertion mutant of OsARF1 showed reduced sensitivity to BR treatment, resembling the phenotype of **OsIAA1**-overexpression plants.
   - Over-expression of **OsIAA1** in rice resulted in reduced inhibition of root elongation to auxin treatment, but increased sensitivity to 24-epiBL treatment.
   - In addition, expression patterns of some genes responsive to brassinosteroid and auxin were changed in the **OsIAA1**-overexpression plants.
   - These data suggested that **OsIAA1** may play important roles in the cross-talk of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling pathways and plant morphogenesis.
   - Characterization of **OsIAA1** gene, a member of rice Aux/IAA family involved in auxin and brassinosteroid hormone responses and plant morphogenesis.
   - Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 interact with **OsIAA1**.
   - This work focused on isolation and characterization of a member of Aux/IAA family in rice named **OsIAA1**.
   - The results indicated that **OsIAA1** was constitutively expressed in all the tissues and organs investigated.
   - Protein interaction analysis suggested that **OsIAA1** may act through interaction with OsARF1.
