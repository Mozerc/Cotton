- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os02g0534400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os02g0534400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsCIN1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - During the course of grain filling in the caryopses, **OsCIN1** transcript is detectable only in the very early stage of their development, 1~4 d after flowering, when the cell wall invertase activity is the highest and the increase in caryopsis length is rapid.
   - Cell Wall Invertase in Developing Rice Caryopsis: Molecular Cloning of **OsCIN1** and Analysis of its Expression in Relation to its Role in Grain Filling.
   - **OsCIN1** is expressed in roots, in sink- and source-leaves, and in panicles.
   - Results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that **OsCIN1** was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to GIF1 that was selected in the promoter region.
   - Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and **OsCIN1** during rice evolution and domestication.
