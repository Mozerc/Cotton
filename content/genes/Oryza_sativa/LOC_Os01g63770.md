- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of an auxin transporter (**OsAUX1**) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to **OsAUX1**, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering.
   - **OsAUX1** controls lateral root initiation in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - The auxin influx carriers in Arabidopsis have been shown to control lateral root development and gravitropism, but little is known about these proteins in rice.
   - Three **OsAUX1** T-DNA insertion mutants and RNAi knockdown transgenic plants reduced lateral root initiation compared to WT plants.
   - **OsAUX1** overexpression plants exhibited increased lateral root initiation and **OsAUX1** was highly expressed in lateral roots and lateral root primordia.
   - Similarly, the auxin reporter, DR5-GUS, was expressed at lower levels in **OsAUX1** than in the WT plants, which indicated that the auxin levels in the mutant roots had decreased.
   - Overall, our results indicated that **OsAUX1** was involved in polar auxin transport and functioned to control auxin-mediated lateral root initiation in rice.
   - Polar auxin transport, mediated by influx and efflux transporters, controls many aspects of plant growth and development.
   - Exogenous NAA treatment rescued the defective phenotype in **OsAUX1**-1 plants, whereas IAA and 2,4-D could not, which suggested that **OsAUX1** was a putative auxin influx carrier.
   - The transcript levels of several auxin-signaling genes and cell cycle genes significantly declined in **OsAUX1**, hinting that the regulatory role of **OsAUX1** may be mediated by auxin-signaling and cell cycle genes.
   - **OsAUX1** expression in root hair cells is different from its paralogous gene, AtAUX1, expressed in non-hair cells.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **OsAUX1** plays an important role in root development and in responses to Cd stress.
   - However, **OsAUX1** - like AtAUX1 - also localizes at the plasma membrane and seems to function as an auxin tranporter.
   - Decreased auxin distribution and contents in **OsAUX1** mutant result in reduction of OsCyCB1;1 expression and shortened PR, LR and RH under Cd stress, but can be rescued by the membrane-permeable auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA).
   - Here, we characterize rice **OsAUX1** mutants that have longer PR and shorter RH in hydroponic culture, and that are more sensitive to Cd stress compared to WT/Dongjin (DJ).
   - Cd contents in the **OsAUX1** mutant were not altered but reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated damage was enhanced, further increasing the **OsAUX1** mutant sensitivity to Cd stress.
   - Moreover, protein localization of auxin transporters PIN1 homologs and GFP tagged **OsAUX1** overlapped with DR5-VENUS during spikelet development, helping validate these auxin response reporters are reliable markers in rice.
   - Rice auxin influx carrier **OsAUX1** facilitates root hair elongation in response to low external phosphate.
   - Here, we attempted to modify root angle in rice by disrupting the **OsAUX1** auxin influx transporter gene in an effort to improve rice P acquisition efficiency.
   - We show by X-ray microCT imaging that root angle is altered in the **OsAUX1** mutant, causing preferential foraging in the top soil where P normally accumulates, yet surprisingly, P acquisition efficiency does not improve.
   - Through closer investigation, we reveal that **OsAUX1** also promotes root hair elongation in response to P limitation.
   - We demonstrate that **OsAUX1** functions to mobilize auxin from the root apex to the differentiation zone where this signal promotes hair elongation when roots encounter low external P.
   - We conclude that auxin and **OsAUX1** play key roles in promoting root foraging for P in rice.
   - The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor OsWOX4 controls the primary root elongation by activating **OsAUX1** in rice.
