## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using Ecotype Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (EcoTILLING) and TILLING as forward genetic tools, we identified the causative mutation of an EMS mutant characterized by excessive tillering, semi-dwarfism and leaf variegation that corresponded to the **PTOX1** gene.
   - The tillering and semi-dwarf phenotypes of the **PTOX1** mutant are similar to phenotypes of known strigolactone (SL)-related rice mutants, and both phenotypic traits could be rescued by application of the synthetic SL GR24.
   - The **PTOX1** mutant accumulated phytoene in white leaf sectors with a corresponding deficiency in beta-carotene, consistent with the expected function of **PTOX1** in promoting phytoene desaturase activity.
