- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0444300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0444300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsARGOS
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsARGOS** transcripts were detected in most of rice tissues, particularly in the young tissues, and its expression was induced in rice seedlings by the application of either auxin or cytokinin.
   - The expression of **OsARGOS** in Arabidopsis may activate the signaling pathways that control cell proliferation and cell expansion during the course of plant growth and development.
   - Expression of a rice **OsARGOS** gene in Arabidopsis promotes cell division and expansion and increases organ size..
   - Since the expression of **OsARGOS** causes organ enlargement, the potential application of this gene through genetic engineering may significantly improve the production of biomass in agricultural practice.
   - We also transferred the **OsARGOS** gene to rice, but the transgenic plants did not show any changes in organ size compared with the control plants.
   - It is likely that the function of **OsARGOS** in organ size control depends on other size regulators in rice.
