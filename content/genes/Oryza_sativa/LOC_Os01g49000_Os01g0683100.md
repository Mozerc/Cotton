## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (**DGL1**), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR.
   - In addition to the dwarf phenotype, **DGL1** produces leaves with abnormally rounded tip regions.
   - GA biosynthetic genes are up-regulated in **DGL1**, but the expression of BR biosynthetic genes is not enhanced.
   - The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in **DGL1** is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 was triggered by GA3 in this mutant.
   - Instead, aberrant microtubule organization caused by the loss of the microtubule-severing function of **DGL1** may result in enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in that enhanced expression was also observed in a BR-deficient mutant with aberrant microtubule organization.
   - We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with **OsKTN60**, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division.
   - These results suggest that the function of **DGL1** is important for cell and organ elongation in rice, and aberrant **DGL1**-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling.
