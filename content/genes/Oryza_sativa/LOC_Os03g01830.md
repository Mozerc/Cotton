- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Disease resistance phenotype assays revealed that the **OsBIRH1**-overexpressing transgenic plants showed an enhanced disease resistance against Alternaria brassicicola and Pseudomonas syringae pv.
   - Expression of **OsBIRH1** was activated in rice seedling leaves after treatment with defence-related signal chemicals, for example benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, l-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and jasmonic acid, and was also up-regulated in an incompatible interaction between a resistant rice genotype and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea.
   - The results suggest that **OsBIRH1** encodes a functional DEAD-box RNA helicase and plays important roles in defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses.
   - Moreover, the **OsBIRH1** transgenic Arabidopsis plants also showed increased tolerance to oxidative stress and elevated expression levels of oxidative defence genes, AtApx1, AtApx2, and AtFSD1.
   - **OsBIRH1**, a DEAD-box RNA helicase with functions in modulating defence responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress.
   - The **TCD33** seedlings also exhibited less chlorophyll contents and severe defects of chloroplast structure under 20<U+2009><a1><e3>C condition.
   - A DEAD-box RNA helicase **TCD33** that confers chloroplast development in rice at seedling stage under cold stress.
   - The transcript expression level of **TCD33** indicated that the genes related to chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and chloroplast development in **TCD33** mutants were down-regulated at 20<U+2009><a1><e3>C, while the down-regulated genes were nearly recovered to or slightly higher than the WT level at 32<U+2009><a1><e3>C.
   - Together, our results suggest that the cold-inducible **TCD33** is essential for early chloroplast development and is important for cold-responsive gene regulation and cold tolerance in rice.
   - Map-based cloning and complementation experiments suggested that **TCD33** encodes a chloroplast-located DEAD-box RNA helicase protein.
