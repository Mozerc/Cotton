## Functional Descriptions:
   - The overexpression of **AP37** and AP59 in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter OsCc1 increased the tolerance to drought and high salinity at the vegetative stage.
   - More importantly, the OsCc1:**AP37** plants showed significantly enhanced drought tolerance in the field, which increased grain yield by 16% to 57% over controls under severe drought conditions, yet exhibited no significant difference under normal growth conditions.
   - Our results suggest that the **AP37** gene has the potential to improve drought tolerance in rice without causing undesirable growth phenotypes.
   - Overexpression of the Transcription Factor **AP37** in Rice Improves Grain Yield under Drought Conditions.
   - We discovered a nucleus-localized ERF gene in rice (Oryza sativa), **OsERF3**, that was rapidly up-regulated in response to feeding by the rice striped stem borer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis.
   - These results suggest that **OsERF3**, an AP2 (APETALA 2 Gene)/ERF transcription factor, binds the LRK6 promoter at this new motif, which might cause differential expression of LRK6 in the 93-11/Nipponbare hybrid.
   - Here, we first revealed that the expression of **OsERF3** was induced by drought, salt, ACC and ABA treatment.
   - Increased tolerance to low temperatures was observed only in OsCc1:**AP37** plants.
   - **OsERF3** is a transcriptional repressor with an ethylene-responsive element-binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif (F/LDLNxxP), which transcriptionally represses the ethylene emission and drought tolerance in rice.
   - Thus, our data reveal that the EAR motif is required for **OsERF3** to transcriptionally regulate the ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice, providing new insight to the roles of ethylene-response factor proteins in regulating ethylene biosynthesis and stress response.
   - EAR motif mutation of rice **OsERF3** alters the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and drought tolerance.
   - We propose that **OsERF3** affects early components of herbivore-induced defense responses by suppressing MAPK repressors and modulating JA, SA, ethylene and H(2)O(2) pathways as well as plant resistance.
   - On the other hand, **OsERF3** was slightly suppressed by the rice brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens (St√•l) and increased susceptibility to this piercing sucking insect, possibly by suppressing H(2)O(2) biosynthesis.
   - Our results also illustrate that **OsERF3** acts as a central switch that gears the plant's metabolism towards an appropriate response to chewing or piercing/sucking insects.
   - Antisense and over-expression of **OsERF3** revealed that it positively affects transcript levels of two mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and two WRKY genes as well as concentrations of jasmonate (JA), salicylate (SA) and the activity of trypsin protease inhibitors (TrypPIs).
   - Moreover, overexpression of **OsERF3**/OsAP2-39 suppressed ethylene synthesis.
   - In addition, application of ACC recovered the drought-sensitive phenotype in the lines overexpressing **OsERF3**, showing that ethylene production contributed to drought response in rice.
   - Transcriptional activation of OsDERF1 in **OsERF3** and OsAP2-39 negatively modulates ethylene synthesis and drought tolerance in rice.
   - Functional analysis revealed that ERF3 was essential for crown root development and acts in auxin- and cytokinin-responsive gene expression..
   - Also, increased expression of ERF3 could partially complement wox11, indicating that the two genes functioned cooperatively to regulate crown root development..
   - Furthermore, ERF3-regulated RR2 expression was involved in crown root initiation, while the ERF3/WOX11 interaction likely repressed RR2 during crown root elongation..
