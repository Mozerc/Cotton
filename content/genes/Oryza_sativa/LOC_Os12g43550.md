- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We conclude that **OsRab5a** plays an essential role in trafficking of storage protein to PBII, possibly as part of its function in organizing the endomembrane system in developing endosperm cells of rice.
   - **OsRab5a** regulates endomembrane organization and storage protein trafficking in rice endosperm cells.
   - These results indicate that the formation of the paramural bodies in **glup4** endosperm was due to a significant disruption of endocytosis and membrane vesicular transport by Rab5a loss of function.
   - Here, we report the isolation of a rice mutant, **gpa1**, that accumulates 57 kDa pro-glutelins in seeds and whose endosperm has a floury appearance.
   - Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that the **gpa1** endosperm cells have an enlarged ER lumen and a smaller protein body II (PBII), and accumulated three types of newly generated subcellular structures.
   - Moreover, a proportion of glutelins in the **gpa1** endosperm cells were not delivered to PBII, and instead were mis-targeted to two of the newly generated structures or secreted.
