- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsBT1-3** expression was high in the young leaves, decreased after the two-leaf stage, and was low in the sheath, and these findings are consistent with the recovery of a number of chloroplasts in the third leaf of sla mutant seedlings.
   - Based on these findings, **OsBT1-3** likely acts as a plastid nucleotide uniporter and is essential for chloroplast development in rice leaves at the young seedling stage.
   - The results also showed that **OsBT1-3**-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was targeted to the chloroplast, and a Western blot assay using a peptide-specific antibody indicated that **OsBT1-3** localizes to the chloroplast envelope.
   - We also demonstrated that **OsBT1-3** functions as a unidirectional transporter of adenine nucleotides.
