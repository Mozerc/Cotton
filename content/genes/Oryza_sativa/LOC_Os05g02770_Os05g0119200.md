- **Gene Symbol:** OsGPRP3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cytological experiments revealed that the cell width of spikelet hull in **OsGPRP3** lines was significantly reduced than that in WT.
   - Taken together, our results reveal that **OsGPRP3** regulates the grain size and shape of rice by influencing the cell width of spikelet hulls and the accumulation of storage protein and lipids.
   - Glycine- and Proline-Rich Protein **OsGPRP3** Regulates Grain Size and Quality in Rice.
   - Knockout and knockdown of **OsGPRP3** led to significant decrease of 1000-grain weight, grain width, and grain thickness.
   - We found that **OsGPRP3** was highly expressed in the seed at 10 days after pollination (DAP) using qRT-PCR, p**OsGPRP3**::GUS and in situ hybridization.
