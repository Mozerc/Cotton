## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g33110](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g33110)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os07g0515100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os07g0515100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsCDPK2,OsCPK2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - High levels of **OsCDPK2** were detected in leaves removed from etiolated plants, as well as in stems and flowers.
   - The morphological phenotype of transgenic plants producing high levels of recombinant **OsCDPK2** was normal until the onset of seed development.
   - Overexpression of the calcium-dependent protein kinase **OsCDPK2** in transgenic rice is repressed by light in leaves and disrupts seed development.
   - **OsCDPK2** protein was expressed at low levels during early seed development, but increased to high levels that were maintained in later stages (20 days after fertilisation, DAF).
   - Rice calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms **OsCDPK2** and OsCDPK11 show different responses to light and different expression patterns during seed development.
   - **OsCPK2** and OSCPK11 mRNAs are equally abundant in rice roots and coleoptiles.
   - **OsCPK2** and OSCPK11 cDNAs are related to SPK, another gene encoding a rice CDPK that is specifically expressed in developing seeds [20].
   - **OsCDPK2** and OsCDPK11 mRNA and protein levels increased in unison during flower development.
