- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsBIDK1</u>&nbsp;<u>OsDGK1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **OsBIDK1** in rice seedlings was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), a chemical activator of the plant defense response, and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, causal agent of blast disease.
   - Transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively express the **OsBIDK1** gene were generated and disease resistance assays showed that overexpression of **OsBIDK1** in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in enhanced resistance against infection by tobacco mosaic virus and Phytophthora parasitica var.
   - These results suggest that **OsBIDK1** may play a role in disease resistance responses.
   - Overexpression of a rice diacylglycerol kinase gene **OsBIDK1** enhances disease resistance in transgenic tobacco.
   - In BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of **OsBIDK1** was induced earlier and at a higher level than in water-treated control seedlings after inoculation with M.
