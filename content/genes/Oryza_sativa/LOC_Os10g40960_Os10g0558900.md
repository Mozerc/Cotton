## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g40960](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g40960)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0558900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0558900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** RL14
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **RL14** was transcribed in sclerenchymatous cells in leaves that remained wrapped inside the sheath.
   - Expression of genes related to secondary cell wall formation was affected in **RL14**-1 mutants, and cellulose and lignin content were altered in **RL14**-1 leaves.
   - In addition, **RL14** mutant plants displayed smaller stomatal complexes and decreased transpiration rates, as compared with the wild type.
   - These results reveal that the **RL14** gene affects water transport in leaves by affecting the composition of the secondary cell wall.
