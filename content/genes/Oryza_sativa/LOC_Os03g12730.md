## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g12730](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g12730)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0228800](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0228800)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsBRR1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsBRR1** expression was low in leaves and undetectable in roots under normal growth conditions, while its transcript was significantly induced in leaves infected with the blast fungus (Ken 54-04) and was moderately affected by ABA, JA and SA treatment.
   - In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) strategy was used to specifically knockdown 59 individual rice genes encoding putative LRR-RLKs, and a novel rice blast resistance-related gene (designated as **OsBRR1**) was identified by screening T(0) RNAi population using a weakly virulent isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae, Ken 54-04.
   - These results indicate that **OsBRR1** is involved in rice resistance responses to blast fungus and mediates resistance to rice blast.
   - A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, **OsBRR1**, is involved in rice blast resistance.
