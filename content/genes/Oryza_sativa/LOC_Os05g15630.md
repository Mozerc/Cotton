## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results suggest that **OsBLE3** is involved in cell elongation in rice through dual regulation by BL and IAA.
   - In situ hybridization detected **OsBLE3** mRNA in the shoot apical meristem, organ primordia and vascular tissue.
   - Reduced **OsBLE3** expression and growth retardation was also observed in **OsBLE3** antisense transgenic rice plants.
   - **OsBLE3**, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice.
   - These results, and the existence of auxin response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the **OsBLE3** gene, indicate that **OsBLE3** expression is under control of both BR and auxin.
   - To investigate the mechanism of BR action in monocots, a brassinolide (BL) upregulated gene designated **OsBLE3** was identified, cloned and characterized in rice.
   - The GUS reporter gene driven by a 2277 bp **OsBLE3** putative promoter was mainly expressed in vascular tissues, branch root primordia and was responsive to exogenous BL treatment.
