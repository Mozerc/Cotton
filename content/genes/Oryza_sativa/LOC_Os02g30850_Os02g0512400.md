## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we report the role of a CC-type GRX gene from rice, **OsGRX8**, in abiotic stress tolerance.
   - Further, the transgenic RNAi rice plants exhibited increased susceptibility to various abiotic stresses, which further confirmed the role of **OsGRX8** in abiotic stress responses.
   - Altogether, these findings suggest the role of **OsGRX8** in regulating abiotic stress response and may be used to engineer stress tolerance in crop plants.
   - **OsGRX8** protein was found to be localized in nucleus and cytosol and its gene expression is induced by various stress conditions and plant hormone auxin.
   - The over-expression of **OsGRX8** in Arabidopsis plants conferred reduced sensitivity to auxin and stress hormone, abscisic acid.
