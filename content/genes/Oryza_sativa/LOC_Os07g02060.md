## Functional Descriptions:
   - WRKY Transcription Factor **OsWRKY29** Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.
   - **OsWRKY29** is a member of WRKY transcription factor family which located in the nuclear.
   - The genetic analyses showed that both knockout and RNAi lines of **OsWRKY29** had enhanced seed dormancy whereas its overexpression lines displayed reduced seed dormancy.
   - In summary, we identified a new ABA signaling repressor **OsWRKY29** that represses seed dormancy by directly downregulating the expression of OsABF1 and OsVP1.
   - In addition, the expression levels of ABA positive response factors OsVP1 and OsABF1 were higher in the **OsWRKY29** mutants but were lower in its overexpression lines.
   - Here, we identified an  **OsWRKY29** mutant with enhanced dormancy in a screen of T-DNA insertion population.
   - WRKY Transcription Factor **OsWRKY29** Represses Seed Dormancy in Rice by Weakening Abscisic Acid Response.
   - The genetic analyses showed that both knockout and RNAi lines of **OsWRKY29** had enhanced seed dormancy whereas its overexpression lines displayed reduced seed dormancy.
   - **OsWRKY29** Functions as a Negative Regulator of Seed Dormancy.
   - **OsWRKY29** Acts as a Repressor of ABA-Inhibited Seed Germination.
