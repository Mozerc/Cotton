## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice sodium-insensitive potassium transporter, **OsHAK5**, confers increased salt tolerance in tobacco BY2 cells.
   - These results suggest that the plasma-membrane localized Na(+) insensitive K(+) transporters, similar to **OsHAK5** identified here, could be used as a tool to enhance salt tolerance in plant cells.
   - Here, in search for Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter for this purpose, bacterial expression system was used to characterize two K(+) transporters, OsHAK2 and **OsHAK5**, isolated from rice (Oryza sativa cv.
   - Under the condition with a large amount of extracellular Na(+), we found that **OsHAK5** functions as a Na(+)-insensitive K(+) transporter, while OsHAK2 is sensitive to extracellular Na(+) and exhibits higher Na(+) over K(+) transport activities.
   - The contribution of **OsHAK5** to K mobilization within the rice plant was confirmed further by the change of K concentration in the xylem sap and K distribution in the transgenic lines when K was removed completely from the external solution.
   - A β-glucuronidase reporter driven by the **OsHAK5** native promoter indicated **OsHAK5** expression in various tissue organs from root to seed, abundantly in root epidermis and stele, the vascular tissues, and mesophyll cells.
   - Overexpression of **OsHAK5** increased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots and salt stress tolerance (shoot growth), while knockout of **OsHAK5** decreased the K-sodium concentration ratio in the shoots, resulting in sensitivity to salt stress.
   - The role of a potassium transporter **OsHAK5** in potassium acquisition and transport from roots to shoots in rice at low potassium supply levels..
   - Here, we show that inactivation of **OsHAK5**, a rice K+ transporter gene, decreased rootward and shootward PAT, tiller number, and the length of both lateral roots and root hairs, while **OsHAK5** overexpression increased PAT, tiller number, and root hair length, irrespective of the K+ supply.
   - The Potassium Transporter **OsHAK5** Alters Rice Architecture via ATP-Dependent Transmembrane Auxin Fluxes.
   - These findings highlight the dual roles of **OsHAK5** in altering cellular chemiosmotic gradients (generated continuously by PM H+-ATPase) and regulating ATP-dependent auxin transport.
   - Both functions may underlie the prominent effect of **OsHAK5** on rice architecture, which may be exploited in the future to increase crop yield via genetic manipulations.
   - Overexpression of **OsHAK5** potassium transporter enhances virus resistance in rice (Oryza sativa)..
   - In contrast, overexpression of **OsHAK5** enhanced resistance to RGSV infection.
   - The accumulation of ROS is perhaps involved in the induction of host resistance against RGSV infection in **OsHAK5** transgenic overexpression rice plants.
   - These findings indicate the crucial role of **OsHAK5** in host resistance to virus infection.
   - Our analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including H(2) O(2) and O(2-) , by DAB and NBT staining, respectively, indicated that RGSV infection as well as **OsHAK5** overexpression increased ROS accumulation in rice leaves.
   - The results suggest that the role of OsHAK26 in maintaining pollen development and fertility may relate to its proper cargo sorting for construction of pollen walls, while the role of OsHAK1 and **OsHAK5** in maintaining seed production likely relates to their transcellular K+ transport activity.
   - Seed-setting rate assay by reciprocal cross-pollination between the mutants of oshak26, oshak1, **OsHAK5** and their wild types confirmed that each HAK transporter is foremost for pollen viability, seed-setting and grain yield.
   - Knockout of either OsHAK26 or plasma membrane located H+-K+ symporter gene OsHAK1 or **OsHAK5** in both Nipponbare and Dongjin cultivars caused distorted anthers, reduced number and germination rate of pollen grains.
   - In vitro assay revealed that the pollen germination rate of **OsHAK5** was dramatically affected by external K+ concentration.
   - 0 m m and less K, the growth of KD was significantly suppressed, suggesting that **OsHAK5** greatly contributed to K absorption under limited K conditions.
   - Rice **OsHAK5** is a major potassium transporter that functions in potassium uptake with high specificity but contributes less to cesium uptake..
