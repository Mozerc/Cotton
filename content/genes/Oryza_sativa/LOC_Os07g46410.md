## Functional Descriptions:
   - We propose that **NTRC** constitutes an alternative system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage, using NADPH as the source of reducing power.
   - Since no light-driven reduced ferredoxin is produced at night, the **NTRC**-BAS1 pathway may be a key detoxification system during darkness, with NADPH produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as the source of reducing power.
   - Rice **NTRC** is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage.
   - An Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutant for **NTRC** shows irregular mesophyll cell shape, abnormal chloroplast structure, and unbalanced BAS1 redox state, resulting in impaired photosynthesis rate under low light.
   - We show that rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplast NADPH THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE (**NTRC**), with a thioredoxin domain, uses NADPH to reduce the chloroplast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1, which then reduces hydrogen peroxide.
   - Moreover, prolonged darkness followed by light/dark incubation produced an increase in hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation in leaves and accelerated senescence of **NTRC**-deficient plants.
