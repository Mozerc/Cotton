## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice glycosyltransferase gene **UGT2** functions in salt stress tolerance under the regulation of bZIP23 transcription factor.
   - The transcription factor OsbZIP23 was demonstrated to regulate the **UGT2** expression under stress conditions.
   - Furthermore, the upstream regulatory mechanism of the **UGT2** gene was identified and we found that a bZIP transcription factor, OsbZIP23, can bind to the **UGT2** promoter and enhance the **UGT2** transcription levels.
   - We found that seedlings overexpressing **UGT2** exhibited better growth than wild type in shoot and root under hydroponic culture with salt stress treatments, while **UGT2**ko mutant lines suffered much more growth inhibition.
   - Rice glycosyltransferase gene **UGT2** was identified to play a crucial role in salt tolerance.
   - When the soil-grown **UGT2** transgenic plants were subjected to salt stress, we also found that **UGT2**ko mutant lines were severely withered and most of them died, while the overexpression lines grew well and had higher survival rate.
   - Compared with wild-type plants, **UGT2** overexpression greatly increased the expression levels of the reactive oxygen species scavenging genes and stress-responsive genes.
