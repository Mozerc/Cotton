## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of the zinc finger protein gene **OsZFP350** improves root development by increasing resistance to abiotic stress in rice..
   - Expression of **OsZFP350** was up-regulated by salt, drought and high temperature, indicating that it might be a regulator in response to abiotic stress in rice root.
   - The primary root length, the number of adventitious and lateral roots was significantly increased in **OsZFP350** transgenic plants when compared to the wild-type.
   - In addition, our results also show that the up-regulated **OsZFP350** could significantly increase the germination rate of seeds under abiotic stress, and attenuate the heat, salinity and drought stress during the development of rice roots.
   - Based on these findings, it could be concluded that **OsZFP350** plays a positive role in the adaptability of rice roots to abiotic stress.
