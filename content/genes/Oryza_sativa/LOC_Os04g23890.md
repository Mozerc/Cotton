## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os04g23890](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g23890)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0304200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0304200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsNPH1b
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Northern blot analysis showed that OsNPH1a was strongly expressed in coleoptiles, whereas **OsNPH1b** was highly expressed in leaves of dark-grown rice seedlings.
   - When the dark-grown seedlings were transferred to the continuous white light, the abundance of the OsNPH1a transcript in coleoptiles rapidly declined to the minimum levels, whereas the **OsNPH1b** transcript level in leaves gradually increased.
   - These results lead us to conclude that expression of OsNPH1a and **OsNPH1b** is differently photoregulated in different tissues of rice seedlings.
