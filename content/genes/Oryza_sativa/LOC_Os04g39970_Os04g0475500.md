- **Gene Symbol:** OsV4
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this paper, we isolated and characterized a temperature-conditional virescent mutant, **OsV4**, in rice (Oryza sativa cultivar Jiahua1 (WT, japonica rice variety)).
   - These findings suggest that **OsV4** plays an important role during early chloroplast development under cold stress in rice.
   - The rice **OsV4** encoding a novel pentatricopeptide repeat protein is required for chloroplast development during the early leaf stage under cold stress.
   - Genetic and molecular analyses uncovered that **OsV4** encodes a novel chloroplast-targeted PPR protein including four PPR motifs.
