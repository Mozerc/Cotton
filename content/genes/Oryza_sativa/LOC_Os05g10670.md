- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsTZF1** gene was expressed at relatively high levels in leaves and shoots, although its transcripts were detected in various organs.
   - Expression of **OsTZF1** was induced by drought, high-salt stress, and hydrogen peroxide.
   - Ubi:**OsTZF1**-OX plants showed improved tolerance to high-salt and drought stresses and vice versa for **OsTZF1**-RNAi plants.
   - Histochemical activity of beta-glucuronidase in transgenic rice plants containing the promoter of **OsTZF1** fused with beta-glucuronidase was observed in callus, coleoptile, young leaf, and panicle tissues.
   - In addition, **OsTZF1** expression was regulated by salt, PEG, and ABA.
   - Microarray analysis revealed that genes related to stress, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and metal homeostasis were regulated in the Ubi:**OsTZF1**-OX plants.
   - Overexpression of **OsTZF1** caused a long leaf sheath relative to wild type (WT) under R and FR, suggesting that **OsTZF1** probably acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in rice seedlings.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsTZF1** driven by a maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter (Ubi:**OsTZF1**-OX [for overexpression]) exhibited delayed seed germination, growth retardation at the seedling stage, and delayed leaf senescence.
   - RNA interference (RNAi) knocked-down plants (**OsTZF1**-RNAi) showed early seed germination, enhanced seedling growth, and early leaf senescence compared with controls.
   - Here, we investigated a cytoplasmic TZF protein, **OsTZF1**, which is involved in photomorphogenesis and ABA responses in rice seedlings.
   - Moreover, ABA-induced growth inhibition of rice seedlings was marked in the **OsTZF1**-overexpression lines compared with WT, suggesting the positive regulation of **OsTZF1** to ABA responses.
   - Overexpression of a phytochrome-regulated tandem zinc finger protein gene, **OsTZF1**, confers hypersensitivity to ABA and hyposensitivity to red light and far-red light in rice seedlings.
   - **OsTZF1** gene expression was also induced by abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid.
   - **OsTZF1**, a CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, confers delayed senescence and stress tolerance in rice by regulating stress-related genes.
   - KEY MESSAGE: **OsTZF1** encodes a cytoplasm-localized tandem zinc finger protein and is regulated by both ABA and phytochrome-mediated light signaling.
   - **OsTZF1** functions in phytochrome-mediated light and ABA responses in rice.
   - Here, we report that transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsTZF1** under own promoter (P(**OsTZF1**):**OsTZF1**-OX [for overexpression]) transferred to soil showed normal growth similar to vector control plants.
