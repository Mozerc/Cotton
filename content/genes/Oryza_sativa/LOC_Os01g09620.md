## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, methyl JA treatments of both seeds and detached leaves from the RNAi and the overexpressing transgenic lines showed hyper- and hyporesponses, respectively, consistent with the negative regulation of the JA pathway by **OsDOS**.
   - The expression of **OsDOS** was down-regulated during natural leaf senescence, panicle development, and pollination, although its transcripts were accumulated in various organs.
   - Together, these results indicate that **OsDOS** is a novel nuclear protein that delays leaf senescence likely, at least in part, by integrating developmental cues to the JA pathway.
   - Here, we report a novel nuclear-localized CCCH-type zinc finger protein, Oryza sativa delay of the onset of senescence (**OsDOS**), involved in delaying leaf senescence in rice.
   - RNAi knockdown of **OsDOS** caused an accelerated age-dependent leaf senescence, whereas its overexpression produced a marked delay of leaf senescence, suggesting that it acts as a negative regulator for leaf senescence.
   - A genome-wide expression analysis further confirmed its negative regulation for leaf senescence and revealed that, in particular, the jasmonate (JA) pathway was found to be hyperactive in the **OsDOS** RNAi transgenic lines but impaired in the **OsDOS** overexpressing transgenic lines, indicating that this pathway is likely involved in the **OsDOS**-mediated delaying of leaf senescence.
   - A novel nuclear-localized CCCH-type zinc finger protein, **OsDOS**, is involved in delaying leaf senescence in rice.
