## Functional Descriptions:
   - A novel rice (Oryza sativa) XTH-related gene, **OsXTH8**, was cloned and characterized after being identified by cDNA microarray analysis of gibberellin-induced changes in gene expression in rice seedlings.
   - These results indicate that **OsXTH8** is differentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in relation to gibberellin and potentially involved in cell elongation processes.
   - **OsXTH8** was preferentially expressed in rice leaf sheath in response to gibberellic acid.
   - In situ hybridization and **OsXTH8** promoter GUS fusion analysis revealed that **OsXTH8** was highly expressed in vascular bundles of leaf sheath and young nodal roots where the cells are actively undergoing elongation and differentiation.
   - Transgenic rice expressing an RNAi construct of **OsXTH8** exhibited repressed growth.
   - In two genetic mutants of rice with abnormal height, the expression of **OsXTH8** positively correlated with the height of the mutants.
