## Functional Descriptions:
   - Analysis of the transgenic rice lines grown under metal(loid) stress revealed almost complete absence of both **OsPCS1** and OsPCS2 transcripts in the developing seeds coupled with the significant reduction in the content of Cd (~51%) and As (~35%) in grains compared with the non-transgenic plant.
   - Map-based cloning identified the responsible genes as OsABCC1 in has1 and **OsPCS1** in has2.
   - In vitro phytochelatin synthesis assay indicated that **OsPCS1** was more sensitive to activation by As than by cadmium, whereas OsPCS2 was more weakly activated by As than by cadmium.
   - The levels of As in grains and node I were similar between the two mutants, suggesting that OsABCC1 preferentially cooperates with **OsPCS1** to sequester As, although rice has another phytochelatin synthase, OsPCS2.
   - Quantitative RT-PCR of each OsPCS transcript in rice seedlings suggested that expression of **OsPCS1**full, the longest **OsPCS1** variant, was most abundant, followed by OsPCS2.
   - To address physiological functions in toxic element tolerance and accumulation, two independent **OsPCS1** mutant rice lines (a T-DNA and a Tos17 insertion line) were identified.
   - The **OsPCS1** mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to As(III) and Cd in hydroponic experiments, showing the importance of **OsPCS1**-dependent PC synthesis for rice As(III) and Cd tolerance.
   - Using rice as a cereal model, we examined physiological roles of **OsPCS1** in the distribution and detoxification of arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd), two toxic elements associated with major food safety concerns.
   - ) has two PCSs (**OsPCS1** and OsPCS2), and we previously revealed that **OsPCS1** has a higher responsiveness to arsenic than to cadmium, while OsPCS2 has a higher responsiveness to cadmium than to arsenic.
   - A chimeric protein in which the 183<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of OsPCS2 were replaced with the 185<U+00A0>C-terminal amino acids of **OsPCS1** showed higher responsiveness to arsenite than to cadmium, similar to **OsPCS1**.
