## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our findings suggest that **CSA** is a key transcriptional regulator for sugar partitioning in rice during male reproductive development.
   - Here, we describe a photoperiod-controlled male sterile line, carbon starved anther (**CSA**), which contains a mutation in an R2R3 MYB transcription regulator of pollen development.
   - We have isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, carbon starved anther (**CSA**), that showed increased sugar contents in leaves and stems and reduced levels of sugars and starch in floral organs.
   - The **CSA**-based photoperiod-sensitive male sterile line allows the establishment of a stable two-line hybrid system, which promises to have a significant impact on agriculture.
   - Mutation in **CSA** creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production.
   - **CSA** was isolated by map-based cloning and was shown to encode an R2R3 MYB transcription factor that was expressed preferentially in the anther tapetal cells and in the sugar-transporting vascular tissues.
   - In particular, the **CSA** mutant had reduced levels of carbohydrates in later anthers and was male sterile.
   - In addition, the expression of MST8, encoding a monosaccharide transporter, was greatly reduced in **CSA** anthers.
   - Furthermore, F(1) plants of **CSA** and a restorer line JP69 exhibited heterosis (hybrid vigor), suggesting the feasibility of using this mutation to create hybrid rice.
   - The **CSA** mutant had reduced accumulation of (14)C-labeled sugars in anther sink tissue.
   - Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes **CSA** expression and **CSA** directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development.
   - Several hub genes coordinating the effects of **CSA** regulation were identified as critical elements determining WT male fertility and further analysis of these and related genes will reveal insights into how **CSA** coordinates sugar metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, and photoperiod sensing in rice anther development.
   - **CSA** played a critical role in regulating sugar metabolism and cell wall synthesis in anthers under short-day conditions, and transcription of key genes inducing **CSA**-directed sterility was upregulated under long-day (LD) conditions though not to WT levels, revealing a mechanism to explain the partial restoration of fertility in rice under LD conditions.
   - Eight direct targets of **CSA** regulation were identified, all of which were genes involved in sugar metabolism and transport (cell wall invertases, SWEETs, and monosaccharide transporters) expressed only in reproductive tissues.
