- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsALMT4</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic rice lines over-expressing (OX) **OsALMT4** released malate from the roots constitutively and had two-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast.
   - We show that **OsALMT4** is expressed in roots and shoots and the **OsALMT4** protein localizes to the plasma membrane.
   - Altered Expression of the Malate-Permeable Anion Channel **OsALMT4** Reduces the Growth of Rice Under Low Radiance.
   - Growth of transgenic lines with either increased **OsALMT4** expression or reduced expression was measured in different environments.
   - Altering **OsALMT4** expression compromises growth in low-light environments.
   - Here, we show that **OsALMT4** is expressed widely in roots, shoots, flowers, and grain but not guard cells.
   - Malate efflux from the transgenic plants over-expressing **OsALMT4** was inhibited by niflumate and salicylic acid.
   - When day-time light was reduced from 700 to 300 <a6><cc>mol m-2s-1 independent transgenic lines with either increased or decreased **OsALMT4** expression accumulated less biomass compared to their null controls.
   - Previous studies showed that **OsALMT4** localizes to the plasma membrane and that expression in transgenic rice lines results in a constitutive release of malate from the roots.
