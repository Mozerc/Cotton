## Functional Descriptions:
   - A substitution mutation in **OsPELOTA** confers bacterial blight resistance by activating the salicylic acid pathway.
   - Here, we report the map-based cloning of the causal gene **OsPELOTA** (originally termed splHM47 ).
   - **LML1** is expressed in all types of leaf cells, and encodes a novel eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
   - **LML1** can partially rescue the growth delay phenotype of the **LML1** yeast ortholog mutant, dom34.
   - Both **LML1** and mutants of At**LML1** (the **LML1** Arabidopsis ortholog) exhibited a growth delay phenotype as dom34.
   - The **LML1** mutant exhibited abnormal cell death and resistance to both bacterial blight and rice blast.
   - The **Ospelo** mutant showed defects in root system development and spotted leaves at early seedling stages.
   - These results demonstrate that **Ospelo** positively regulates root development while its loss of function enhances pathogen resistance by pre-activation of defence responses in rice.
   - Defence responses were induced in the **Ospelo** mutant, as shown by enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - Detailed analysis showed that activation of a number of innate immunity-related genes might be responsible for the enhanced disease resistance in the **Ospelo** mutant.
   - **Ospelo** was found to be expressed in various tissues throughout the plant, and the protein was located in mitochondria.
   - In addition, whole-genome transcriptome analysis showed that **Ospelo** was significantly associated with a number of biological processes, including translation, metabolism and biotic stress response.
