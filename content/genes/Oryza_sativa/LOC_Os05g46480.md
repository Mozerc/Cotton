## Functional Descriptions:
   - Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, **OsLEA3**, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions.
   - Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, **OsLEA3** and rab16C.
   - In this report, a LEA protein gene **OsLEA3-1** was identified and over-expressed in rice to test the drought resistance of transgenic lines under the field conditions.
   - These results indicate that transgenic rice with significantly enhanced drought resistance and without yield penalty can be generated by over-expressing **OsLEA3-1** gene with appropriate promoters and following a bipartite (stress and non-stress) in-field screening protocol.
   - Drought resistance pre-screening of T(1) families at anthesis stage revealed that the over-expressing families with **OsLEA3**-S and **OsLEA3**-H constructs had significantly higher relative yield (yield under drought stress treatment/yield under normal growth conditions) than the wild type under drought stress conditions, although a yield penalty existed in T(1) families under normal growth conditions.
   - **OsLEA3-1** is induced by drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA), but not by cold stress.
   - The promoter of **OsLEA3-1** isolated from the upland rice IRAT109 exhibits strong activity under drought- and salt-stress conditions.
   - Three expression constructs consisting of the full-length cDNA driven by the drought-inducible promoter of **OsLEA3-1** (OsLEA3-H), the CaMV 35S promoter (OsLEA3-S), and the rice Actin1 promoter (OsLEA3-A) were transformed into the drought-sensitive japonica rice Zhonghua 11.
   - Exogenous application of ABA and exposure to salt shock (150 mM NaCl) rapidly induces a de novo, abundant **OsLEA3** transcript accumulation in seedling roots, whereas application of jasmonic acid (9 microM) does not induce **OsLEA3** expression.
   - The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and **OsLEA3** under salt stress.
   - Except for two families (transformed with **OsLEA3**-A), all the other families (transformed with **OsLEA3**-S and **OsLEA3**-H constructs) had higher grain yield than the wild type under drought stress in both the field and the PVC pipes conditions.
   - The encoded **OsLEA3** protein has previously been found to accumulate to higher levels in roots of two salt-tolerant compared to a salt-sensitive rice variety in response to abscisic acid (ABA) [Moons et al.
   - The stress-induced **OsLEA3** transcript gradually declined upon prolonged salt shock, as wilting-induced damage became irreversible.
   - **OsLEA3** expression was compared for the salt-tolerant variety Pokkali and the salt-sensitive cultivar Taichung N1.
   - The results suggest that a differential regulation of **OsLEA3** expression is an aspect of the varietal differences in salt stress tolerance.
   - Collectively, our results indicate that the stress-responsive proteins OsNAC5 and OsNAC6 are transcriptional activators that enhance stress tolerance by upregulating the expression of stress-inducible rice genes such as **OsLEA3**, although the effects of these proteins on growth are different.
   - A cDNA clone **OsLEA3**, encoding a group 3 late-embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein was isolated from roots of rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.
   - Real-time PCR analysis revealed that some abiotic stress-related genes, such as **OsLEA3**, OsTPP1, Rab25, gp1 precursor, beta-gal, LOC_Os05g11910 and LOC_Os05g39250, were down-regulated in OsbZIP52 overexpression lines.
