## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Docs1** mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers.
   - In this work, we report on defective in outer cell layer specification 1 (**Docs1**), which is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots.
   - **Docs1** was isolated by map-based cloning using a mutant (c68) defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots.
   - Immunostaining with an anti-**Docs1** antibody showed that **Docs1** was localized at the epidermis and exodermis, depending on the root region.
   - These results suggest that **Docs1** might directly or indirectly regulate multiple genes involved in the proper development of root outer cell layers in rice.
   - All these observations add new insights into the **Docs1** gene function in gravitropic responses at several stages of plant development.
   - Root cone angle is enlarged in **Docs1** LRR-RLK mutants in rice..
   - Besides the aluminum sensitivity phenotype, both **Docs1** mutants shared also several root phenotypes described previously: less root hairs and mixed identities of the outer cell layers.
   - Moreover, our new results suggest that **Docs1** could also play a role in root cap development.
   - We hypothesized these **Docs1** root phenotypes may affect gravity responses.
   - Furthermore, at adult stage, the root gravitropic set angle of **Docs1** mutants was also affected since **Docs1** mutant plants displayed larger root cone angles.
   - The c68 (**Docs1**-1) mutant possessed a nonsense mutation in the C-terminal part of the **Docs1** kinase domain.
