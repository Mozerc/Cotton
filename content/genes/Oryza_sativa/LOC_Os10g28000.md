## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this work, we describe the cloning and characterization of the full-length cDNA encoding **OsGR3**, a chloroplast-localized GR that up to now was considered as a non-functional enzyme because of assumed lack of N-terminal conserved domains.
   - **OsGR3** shows 76 and 53 % identity with OsGR1 (chloroplastic) and OsGR2 (cytosolic), respectively.
   - A plastid transit peptide is located at the N terminus of **OsGR3**, and genetic transformation of rice with a GR3-GFP fusion construct further confirmed its localization in chloroplasts.
   - Furthermore, OsGR1 and **OsGR3** are also targeted to mitochondria, which suggest a combined antioxidant mechanism in both chloroplasts and mitochondria.
   - In addition, the transcript level of **OsGR3** was greatly increased with salicylic acid treatment but was not significantly affected by methyl jasmonate, dehydration or heat shock stress.
   - In fact, exogenous application of ABA enhanced the expression of OsGR2 and **OsGR3** in rice roots.
   - On inhibiting ABA accumulation with sodium tungstate (Tu), an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, the expression of OsGR2 and **OsGR3** was still induced by NaCl; therefore, NaCl-triggered expression of OsGR2 and **OsGR3** in rice roots is not mediated by accumulation of ABA.
   - However, both isoforms showed a distinct response to salinity: the expression of **OsGR3** but not OsGR1 was induced by salt stress.
   - Our results provide new clues about the possible roles of functional **OsGR3** in salt stress and biotic stress tolerance.
   - Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and **OsGR3**) isoforms of GR identified in the rice genome.
   - Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was applied to quantify the mRNA levels for one cytosolic (OsGR2) and two chloroplastic (OsGR1 and **OsGR3**) isoforms of glutathione reductase identified in the rice genome.
   - The expression of OsGR2 and **OsGR3** but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with NaCl.
   - NaCl-induced OsGR2 and **OsGR3** in rice roots could be associated with Na(+) but not an osmotic component.
   - The expression of OsGR2 and **OsGR3** but not OsGR1 was increased in rice roots treated with 150 mM NaCl.
   - However, NaCl treatment could induce H2O2 production in rice roots, and H2O2 treatment resulted in enhanced OsGR2 and **OsGR3** induction.
   - Moreover, the increase in H2O2 level was prior to the induction of OsGR2 and **OsGR3** in NaCl-treated rice roots.
   - Thus, H2O2, but not ABA, is involved in regulation of OsGR2 and **OsGR3** expression in NaCl-treated rice roots.
   - **GR3** promoter-GUS was expressed in the vascular cylinder and cortex of root tissues in rice seedlings, vascular tissue of nodes, embryo and aleurone layer of seeds, and young flowers.
   - Previously, we showed that salt-stress-responsive **GR3** is a functional protein localized in chloroplasts and mitochondria in rice.
   - Rice **GR3** was primarily expressed in roots at the seedling stage and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues except the sheath at heading stage.
   - Oxidative stress, indicated by malondialdehyde content, was greater in **GR3** than the WT under salt stress.
   - As compared with the WT, **GR3** was sensitive to salt and methyl viologen; it showed inhibited growth, decreased maximal efficiency of photosystem II, decreased GSH and GSSG contents, and the ratio of GSH to GSSG.
   - These results reveal that **GR3** plays an important role in salt stress tolerance by regulating the GSH redox state in rice.
   - To learn more about the role of **GR3** in salt-stress tolerance, we investigated the response to 100Â mM NaCl treatment in wild-type rice (WT); **GR3** knockout mutant of rice (**GR3**); and the functional **GR3**-complementation line (C1).
