- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Phylogenetic analysis implies that **SP1** might be a nitrate transporter.
   - However, neither nitrate transporter activity nor any other compounds transported by known PTR proteins could be detected in either a Xenopus oocyte or yeast system, in our study, suggesting that **SP1** may need other component(s) to be able to function as a transporter, or that it transports unknown substrates in the monocotyledonous rice plant.
   - Gene cloning and characterization indicate that **SP1** encodes a putative transporter that belongs to the peptide transporter (PTR) family.
   - Here, we report on a novel rice mutant, short panicle1 (**SP1**), which is defective in rice panicle elongation, and thus leads to the short-panicle phenotype.
   - The **SP1** gene is highly expressed in the phloem of the branches of young panicles, which is consistent with the predicted function of **SP1** and the **SP1** phenotype.
