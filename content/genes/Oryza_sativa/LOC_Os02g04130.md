## Functional Descriptions:
   - Together, our results suggest that **OsSGL** may regulate stress-tolerance and cell growth by acting via a cytokinin signaling pathway.
   - Overexpression of **OsSGL** significantly altered certain development processes greatly and positively affecting an array of traits in transgenic rice plants, including increased grain length, grain weight and grain number per panicle, resulting in a significant increase in yield.
   - Microscopical analysis showed that the enhanced **OsSGL** expression promoted cell division and grain filling.
   - These results suggest that the mechanism by which **OsSGL** confers enhanced drought tolerance is due to the modulated expression of stress-responsive genes, higher accumulations of osmolytes, and enlarged root systems.
   - We investigated **OsSGL** (Oryza sativa Stress tolerance and Grain Length), a novel DUF1645 domain-containing protein from rice.
   - Transgenic plants over-expressing or hetero-expressing **OsSGL** conferred significantly improved drought tolerance in transgenic rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively.
   - **OsSGL** was up-regulated by multiple stresses and localized to the nucleus.
   - Transcription factor **OsSGL** is a regulator of starch synthesis and grain quality in rice.
   - Therefore, our findings demonstrate that accurate control of **OsSGL** homeostasis is essential for starch synthesis and grain quality.
   - In addition, we revealed the molecular mechanism of **OsSGL** in regulating starch biosynthesis-related genes, which are required for grain quality.
   - Overexpression of **OsSGL** reduced total starch and amylose content in the endosperm compared with the wild type.
   - Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-seq analyses indicated that **OsSGL** targets the transcriptional activity of several starch and sucrose metabolism genes.
   - Unexpectedly, our results also show that knock down and mutation of **OsSGL** disrupts the starch biosynthetic pathway, causing lower starch and amylose content.
   - In addition, ChIP-qPCR, yeast one-hybrid, EMSA and dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that **OsSGL** directly inhibits the expression of SUCROSE SYNTHASE 1 (OsSUS1) in the endosperm.
