## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of **OsLSK1** responded to the exogenous application of growth hormones, to abiotic stresses, and its extracellular domain could form homodimers or heterodimers with other related SRKs.
   - Over-expression of a truncated version of **OsLSK1** (including the extracellular and transmembrane domain of **OsLSK1** without the intracellular kinase domain) increased plant height and improve yield components, including primary branches per panicle and grains per primary branch, resulting in about a 55.
   - The utility of transgenic expression of a dominant negative form of SRK, **OsLSK1** (Large spike S-domain receptor like Kinase 1), is reported here for the improvement of grain yield components in rice.
   - These results indicate that **OsLSK1** may act redundantly with its homologues to affect yield traits in rice and manipulation of **OsLSK1** by the dominant negative method is a practicable strategy to improve grain yield in rice and other crops.
   - **OsLSK1** was highly expressed in nodes of rice and is a plasma membrane protein.
