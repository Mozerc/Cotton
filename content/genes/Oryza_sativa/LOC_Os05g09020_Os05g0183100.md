## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os05g09020](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os05g09020)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os05g0183100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os05g0183100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsWRKY67
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OsWRKY67** in rice confirmed enhanced disease resistance, but led to a restriction of plant growth in transgenic lines with high levels of **OsWRKY67** protein.
   - **OsWRKY67** Plays a Positive Role in Basal and XA21-Mediated Resistance in Rice..
   - Activation of **OsWRKY67** by T-DNA tagging significantly improved the resistance against two rice pathogens, Magnaporthe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - **OsWRKY67** RNAi lines significantly reduced resistance to M.
   - oryzae and Xoo isolates tested, and abolished XA21-mediated resistance, implying the possibility of broad-spectrum resistance from **OsWRKY67**.
   - Therefore, these results suggest that **OsWRKY67** positively regulates basal and XA21-mediated resistance, and is a promising candidate for genetic improvement of disease resistance in rice.
   - Transcriptional activity and subcellular localization assays indicated that **OsWRKY67** is present in the nucleus where it functions as a transcriptional activator.
   - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) rapidly accumulated in **OsWRKY67** activation mutant lines in response to elicitor treatment, compared with the controls.
   - Here, we identified that the transcription of **OsWRKY67** was strongly activated by leaf and panicle blast infection.
   - Rice plants overexpressing **OsWRKY67** showed quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight.
   - These results together suggest the positive role of **OsWRKY67** in regulating rice responses to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight disease.
   - **OsWRKY67** positively regulates blast and bacteria blight resistance by direct activation of PR genes in rice..
   - RNA-seq analysis indicated that **OsWRKY67** induces the transcription of a set of defense-related genes including the ones involved in the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent pathway.
   - In contrast, silencing of **OsWRKY67** increased the susceptibility to blast and bacterial blight diseases.
   - **OsWRKY67** is ubiquitously expressed and sub-localized in the nucleus.
