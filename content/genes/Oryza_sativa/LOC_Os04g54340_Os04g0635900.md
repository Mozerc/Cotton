- **Gene Symbol:** OsMRE11
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Taken together, our results provide evidence that **OsMRE11** performs a function essential for maintaining the normal HR process and inhibiting non-homologous recombination during meiosis.
   - Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated that **OsMRE11** is required for homologous synapsis and DSB processing but is dispensable for meiotic DSB formation.
   - We found that **OsMRE11** protein was located on meiotic chromosomes from interphase to late pachytene.
   - The **OsMRE11**-deficient plants exhibited normal vegetative growth but could not set seed.
   - **OsMRE11** Is Required for Mitosis during Rice Growth and Development.
   - These results indicated that **OsMRE11** plays vital roles in DNA replication and damage repair of the mitotic cell cycle, which ensure the development and fertility of rice by maintaining genome stability.
   - The decreased number of cells in the apical meristem and the appearance of chromosomal fragments and bridges during the mitotic cell cycle in rice mre11 mutant roots revealed an essential role of **OsMRE11**.
   - Moreover, **OsMRE11** could form a complex with OsRad50 and OsNbs1, and they might function together in non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair pathways.
