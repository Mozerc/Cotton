## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os12g41220](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os12g41220)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os12g0605400](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os12g0605400)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsUEV1B
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Some Pi starvation inducible and phosphate transporter genes were upregulated in **OsUEV1B** mutant and **OsUEV1B**-RNAi plants in association with enhanced Pi acquisition, and representative Pi starvation responses, including stimulation of acid phosphatase activity and root hair growth, were also activated in the presence of sufficient Pi.
   - In the present study, we found **OsUEV1B** was specifically inhibited by Pi deficiency, and was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm.
   - Our results indicate that **OsUEV1B** is required for rice phosphate homeostasis.
   - Both **OsUEV1B** mutant and **OsUEV1B**-RNA interference (RNAi) lines displayed serious symptoms of toxicity due to Pi overaccumulation.
   - Moreover, overexpression of OsVDAC1 in **OsUEV1B** partially restored its high Pi concentration to a level between those of **OsUEV1B** and DongJin.
