## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g35370](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g35370)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0496900](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0496900)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsPORB;FGL
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice faded green leaf (**FGL**) mutants develop yellow/white leaf variegation and necrotic lesions during leaf elongation in field-grown plants.
   - In **FGL**, etiolated seedlings contained smaller PLBs in etioplasts, and lower levels of total and photoactive Pchlide.
   - OsPORA was expressed at high levels in developing leaves and decreased dramatically in fully mature leaves, whereas **OsPORB** expression was relatively constant throughout leaf development, similar to expression patterns of AtPORA and AtPORB in Arabidopsis.
   - Our results demonstrate that **OsPORB** is essential for maintaining light-dependent Chl synthesis throughout leaf development, especially under HL conditions, whereas OsPORA mainly functions in the early stages of leaf development.
   - OsPORA is expressed in the dark during early leaf development; **OsPORB** is expressed throughout leaf development regardless of light conditions.
   - The faded green leaf (fgl) is a loss-of-function **OsPORB** mutant that displays necrotic lesions and variegation in the leaves due to destabilized grana thylakoids, and has increased numbers of plastoglobules in the chloroplasts.
   - The physiological function of **OsPORB** in response to constant light or during reproductive growth cannot be completely replaced by constitutive activity of OsPORA, although the biochemical functions of OsPORA and **OsPORB** are redundant.
