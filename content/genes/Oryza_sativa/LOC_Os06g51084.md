## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice starch branching enzyme 1 (**SBE1**) and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) catalyzed the biosynthesis of amylopectin and amylose in rice developing endosperm respectively, and the genes encoding these two enzymes, **SBE1** and waxy, are mainly expressed in the endosperm.
   - The cDNA of two SBE(starch-branching enzyme) genes **SBE1** and Sbe3 encoding SBE I and SBE III (two major isoforms in rice) were cloned by an improved RT-PCR technique, from a template cDNA library derived from the total mRNAs extracted from the immature seeds of a japonica rice Wuyunjing 7.
   - The cloned **SBE1** and Sbe3 cDNAs make it possible to improve rice starch quality through genetic engineering.
   - We determined the crystal structure of the rice branching enzyme I (**BEI**) in complex with maltopentaose at a resolution of 2.
   - Crystal structure of the rice branching enzyme I (**BEI**) in complex with maltopentaose.
   - We overproduced rice branching enzyme I (**BEI**) in Escherichia coli cells, and the resulting enzyme (r**BEI**) was characterized with respect to biochemical and crystallographic properties.
   - Biochemical and Crystallographic Characterization of the Starch Branching Enzyme I (**BEI**) fromOryza sativaL.
   - The rice branching enzyme I (**BEI**) overproduced in Escherichia coli cells was investigated with respect to action on starches.
   - The Action of Rice Branching Enzyme I (**BEI**) on Starches.
   - Within the 5'-upstream region of rice **SBE1** gene, we identified a 53 bp fragment C53 which could interact with the nuclear proteins extracted from rice endosperm.
   - These results suggested that the expression of **SBE1** and waxy gene in rice developing endosperm may be coordinately regulated by REB-like bZIP transcriptional factors.
   - Furthermore, OsbZIP58 was shown to bind directly to the promoters of six starch-synthesizing genes, OsAGPL3, Wx, OsSSIIa, **SBE1**, OsBEIIb, and ISA2, and to regulate their expression.
   - **BEI** treatment decreased the turbidity of starch suspensions with distinct pasting behaviors from a native starch.
   - Mutations of either **BEI** or **BEI**Ia did not alter the starch crystallite pattern (A-type).
   - It is concluded that the relative importance in determining starch fine structures and functionality was in the order of **BEI**Ib &gt; **BEI** &gt; **BEI**Ia.
