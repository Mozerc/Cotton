## Functional Descriptions:
   - To address the problem of iron-deficiency anemia, one of the most prevalent human micronutrient deficiencies globally, iron-biofortified rice was produced using three transgenic approaches: by enhancing iron storage in grains via expression of the iron storage protein ferritin using endosperm-specific promoters, enhancing iron translocation through overproduction of the natural metal chelator nicotianamine, and enhancing iron flux into the endosperm by means of iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter **OsYSL2** expression under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter and sucrose transporter promoter.
   - These results suggest that **OsYSL2** is a rice metal-NA transporter that is responsible for the phloem transport of iron and manganese, including the translocation of iron and manganese into the grain.
   - **OsYSL2** is a rice metal-nicotianamine transporter that is regulated by iron and expressed in the phloem.
   - We previously isolated **OsYSL2**, a functional iron [Fe(II)]- and manganese [Mn(II)]-nicotianamine complex transporter that is expressed in phloem cells and developing seeds.
   - Furthermore, when **OsYSL2** expression was driven by the sucrose transporter promoter, the Fe concentration in the polished rice was up to 4.
   - These results indicate that the altered expression of **OsYSL2** changes the localization of Fe, and that **OsYSL2** is a critical Fe-nicotianamine transporter important for Fe translocation, especially in the shoots and endosperm.
   - Rice metal-nicotianamine transporter, **OsYSL2**, is required for the long-distance transport of iron and manganese.
   - Of particular interest was **OsYSL2**, the transcripts of which were not detected in the roots of either iron-sufficient or iron-deficient plants, but dramatic expression was induced in the leaves by iron deficiency.
   - Promoter:beta-glucuronidase (GUS) analysis revealed that **OsYSL2** was expressed in companion cells in iron-sufficient roots.
   - Several genes up-regulated by iron deficiency, including the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene **OsYSL2**, were less induced by iron deficiency in the RNAi rice of IDEF2, suggesting that IDEF2 is involved in the regulation of these genes.
   - At the vegetative stage in an **OsYSL2**i line, the Fe and Mn concentrations were decreased in the shoots, and the Fe concentration was increased in the roots.
   - The Fe and Mn concentrations were decreased in the seeds of **OsYSL2**i, especially in the endosperm.
   - Moreover, the Fe concentration in OX**OsYSL2** was lower in the seeds and shoots, but higher in the roots, compared with the wild type.
   - Electrophysiological measurements using Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that **OsYSL2** transported iron(II)-nicotianamine (NA) and manganese(II)-NA, but did not transport iron(III)-phyosiderophore.
   - At the reproductive stage, positron-emitting tracer imaging system analysis revealed that Fe translocation to the shoots and seeds was suppressed in **OsYSL2**i.
   - Strong **OsYSL2** promoter activity was also detected in developing seeds.
   - In iron-deficient leaves, the **OsYSL2** promoter was active in all tissues with particularly strong GUS activity evident in companion cells.
   - The phloem-specific expression of the **OsYSL2** promoter suggests that **OsYSL2** is involved in the phloem transport of iron.
   - CF1 is allelic to the metal transporter **OsYSL2**, which transports Fe from the roots to the shoots.
   - Further analysis showed that high expression levels of **CF1** improve Fe nutrition in the shoots, subsequently inhibiting Cd uptake by systemically inhibiting expression of the main Cd uptake gene OsNramp5 in the roots.
   - Compared with the **CF1** allele from &#x27;02428&#x27; (**CF1**(02428) ), higher expression levels of **CF1** from &#x27;TQ&#x27; (**CF1**(TQ) ) increased the Fe contents and decreased Cd levels in rice grains.
