## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice **OsTPC1** is predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (PM), and assumed to play an important role as a Ca(2)(+)-permeable cation channel in the regulation of cytosolic Ca(2)(+) rise and innate immune responses including hypersensitive cell death and phytoalexin biosynthesis in cultured rice cells triggered by a fungal elicitor, xylanase from Trichoderma viride.
   - A putative voltage-gated cation channel, **OsTPC1** has been shown to play a critical role in hypersensitive cell death induced by a fungal xylanase protein (TvX) in suspension-cultured rice cells.
   - **OsTPC1** rescued the Ca2+ uptake activity and growth rate of a yeast mutant cch1.
   - **OsTPC1**-overexpressing cells showed hypersensitivity to excess Ca2+ but higher growth rate under Ca2+ limitation, while growth of the **OsTPC1**-knockout cultured cells was less sensitive to extracellular free Ca2+ concentration, suggesting that **OsTPC1** has Ca2+ transport activity across the plasma membrane.
   - **OsTPC1**-overexpressing plants showed reduced growth and abnormal greening of roots.
   - Growth of **OsTPC1** seedlings was comparable to the control on agar plates, while significantly reduced in adult plants.
   - These results suggest that **OsTPC1** functions as a Ca2+ -permeable channel involved in the regulation of growth and development.
   - Identification of a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ -permeable channel (**OsTPC1**) involved in Ca2+ influx and regulation of growth and development in rice.
   - We here identified a gene (**OsTPC1**) encoding a putative voltage-gated Ca2+ channel from rice, ubiquitously expressed in mature leaves, shoots and roots as well as in cultured cells.
