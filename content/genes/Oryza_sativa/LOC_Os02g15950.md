## Functional Descriptions:
   - Genetic analysis revealed that the erect panicle phenotype was controlled by a single recessive mutation designated erect panicle 3 (**EP3**).
   - A line carrying a T-DNA insertion in LOC_ Os02g15950 was obtained and shown to have the same phenotype as the **EP3** mutant, thus confirming the identification of LOC_Os02g15950 as the ERECT PANICLE 3 (**EP3**) gene.
   - The **EP3** mutation causes a significant increase in the number of small vascular bundles as well as the thickness of parenchyma in the peduncle, which results in the erect panicle phenotype.
   - We report herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (**LP**) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture.
   - These results suggest that **LP** plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants.
   - Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that **LP** might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues.
   - Map-based cloning reveals that LARGER PANICLE (**LP**) encodes a Kelch repeat-containing F-box protein.
   - This anatomical characteristic may account for the observed decrease in leaf photosynthesis and provides evidence that **EP3** plays a role in regulating stomatal guard cell development.
   - Ectopic expression of the Os02g15950 coding sequence, driven by the HWS (At3g61950) promoter, rescued the hws-1 flower phenotype in Arabidopsis confirming that **EP3** is a functional orthologue of HWS.
   - However, both **EP3** mutant plants and transgenic lines that have a T-DNA insertion within the Os02g15950 (**EP3**) gene exhibit smaller stomatal guard cells compared with their wild-type controls.
   - We have identified the putative orthologue genes of the rice microRNA pathway for ORYZA SATIVA DAWDLE (OsDDL) and ORYZA SATIVA SERRATE (OsSE), and demonstrated that **EP3** and OsFBK1 affect their transcript levels as well as those of CROWN ROOT DEFECT 1/ORYZA SATIVA Exportin-5 HASTY (CRD1/OsHST), ORYZA SATIVA DICER-LIKE 1 (OsDCL) and ORYZA SATIVA WEAVY LEAF1 (OsWAF1).
   - The Rice **EP3** and OsFBK1 E3 ligases alter plant architecture and flower development, and affect transcript accumulation of microRNA pathway genes and their targets.
   - Loss, reduction or gain of function lines for **EP3** and OsFBK1, show that **EP3** and OsFBK1 affect plant architecture, organ size, floral organ number and size, floral morphology, pollen viability, grain size and weight.
