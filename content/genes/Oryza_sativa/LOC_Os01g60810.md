## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsOFP6** was shown to interfere with auxin in regulating lateral root growth and initiation, as RNAi plants had increased density of lateral roots under IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) treatment.
   - Here, we report that rice **OsOFP6** regulates growth and development, and alters responses to drought and cold stresses.
   - Knock-down of **OsOFP6** by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in semi-dwarf stature, altered grain shape, and shorter lateral roots.
   - Furthermore, under drought conditions OE lines showed slower water loss and less accumulation of H2O2 compared with RNAi plants, which displayed faster water loss and higher H2O2, implying that **OsOFP6** may confer both drought avoidance and drought tolerance in rice plants.
   - In addition, under cold treatment OE and RNAi plants exhibited lower and higher relative electrical conductivity (REC), respectively, suggesting an important role of **OsOFP6** in response to cold stress.
   - **OsOFP6** also affects polar auxin transport, which was demonstrated by the different responses of RNAi and **OsOFP6**-overexpression (OE) plants to treatment with N-1-naphthylphalamic acid (NPA).
   - Transgenic plants with knock-down of **OsOFP6** by RNA interference showed increased leaf angle, which resulted from the thinner secondary cell wall with reduced amounts of cellulose and lignin, whilst overexpression of **OsOFP6** in rice led to the thinker secondary cell wall with increased lignin content.
   - Taken together, our study provides insights into the function of **OsOFP6** in regulating leaf angle and the control of biosynthesis of secondary cell wall.
   - The interaction of **OsOFP6** and OSH15 enhanced the transcriptional activity of OSH15 which binds to the promoter of OsIRX9 (Oryza sativa IRREGULAR XYLEM 9).
   - Rice OVATE family protein 6 regulates leaf angle by modulating secondary cell wall biosynthesis.
   - Transgenic plants with knock-down of **OsOFP6** by RNA interference showed increased leaf angle, which resulted from the thinner secondary cell wall with reduced amounts of cellulose and lignin, whilst overexpression of **OsOFP6** in rice led to the thinker secondary cell wall with increased lignin content.
   - Taken together, our study provides insights into the function of **OsOFP6** in regulating leaf angle and the control of biosynthesis of secondary cell wall.
