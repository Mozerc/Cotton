- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Asr3</u>&nbsp;<u>OsASR3</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Coexpression analysis of OsASR1 and **OsASR3** and a comparison of the cis-acting elements upstream of OsASR1 and **OsASR3** suggested that their expression is regulated in common by abiotic stresses but differently regulated by hormone and sugar signals.
   - Abiotic stress responsive rice ASR1 and **Asr3** exhibit different tissue-dependent sugar and hormone-sensitivities.
   - Our data also showed that the overexpression of either OsASR1 or **OsASR3** in transgenic rice plants increased their tolerance to drought and cold stress.
   - OsASR1 and **OsASR3** are the most abundant and are found in most tissues; they are enriched in the leaves and roots, respectively.
   - , OsASR1 in leaves and **OsASR3** in roots).
   - The expression of both OsASR1 and **OsASR3** was induced by drought stress, which is a major regulator of the expression of all ASR genes in rice.
