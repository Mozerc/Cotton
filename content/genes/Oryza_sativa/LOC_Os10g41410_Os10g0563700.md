## Functional Descriptions:
   - A nucleoside diphosphate kinase gene **OsNDPK4** is involved in root development and defense responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - Dysfunctional mutation of **OsNDPK4** resulted in severe defects in root development of rice.
   - The rice mutant **OsNDPK4** showed severe defects in root development from the early seedling stage.
   - However, the resistance of **OsNDPK4** against bacterial blight was significantly enhanced.
   - **OsNDPK4** showed enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - Our results demonstrate that **OsNDPK4** plays important roles in energy homeostasis, development process, and defense responses in rice.
   - Detailed analysis revealed that the dysfunction of **OsNDPK4** might reorchestrate energy homeostasis and hormone metabolism and signalling, resulting in repression of translation, DNA replication and cell cycle progression, and priming of biotic stress defense.
   - Map-based cloning identified that the mutation occurred in the **OsNDPK4** gene.
   - In addition, transcriptomic analysis showed that **OsNDPK4** was significantly associated with a number of biological processes, including translation, protein modification, metabolism, biotic stress response, etc.
