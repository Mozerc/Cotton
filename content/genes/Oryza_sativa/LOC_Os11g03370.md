## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, a rice NAC gene, **ONAC045**, was functionally characterized, especially with regard to its role in abiotic stress resistance.
   - Expression analysis revealed that **ONAC045** was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in leaves and roots.
   - Together, these results suggest that **ONAC045** encodes a novel stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice.
   - Transgenic rice plants overexpressing **ONAC045** showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt treatments.
   - Immunostaining showed that **OsNAC45** was localized in all root cells and was mainly expressed in the stele.
   - Previous reports have demonstrated that overexpression of **OsNAC45** enhances salt and drought tolerance in rice, and that **OsNAC45** may regulate the expression of two specific genes, OsPM1 and OsLEA3-1.
   - **OsNAC45** is Involved in ABA Response and Salt Tolerance in Rice.
   - Knockout of **OsNAC45** also resulted in more ROS accumulation in roots and increased sensitivity of rice to salt stress.
   - Results: Here, we found that ABA repressed, and NaCl promoted, the expression of **OsNAC45** in roots.
   - Loss of **OsNAC45** decreased the sensitivity of rice plants to ABA and over-expressing this gene had the opposite effect, which demonstrated that **OsNAC45** played an important role during ABA signal responses.
   - Conclusions: These results indicate that **OsNAC45** plays vital roles in ABA signal responses and salt tolerance in rice.
