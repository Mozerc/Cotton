## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g21370](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g21370)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0331600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0331600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** CS3
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - DAB staining and H2O2 content measurement showed that there was excessive H2O2 accumulation in the **CS3** mutant leaf.
   - Accompanying the chlorophyll deficiency, the chloroplasts in **CS3** leaf cells were abnormal.
   - The **CS3** mutant seedlings exhibit a yellowish phenotype at germination, and they do not survive at the seedling stage.
   - **CS3** is mainly expressed in green tissues and the S136â€‰F would influence **CS3** interacting with YGL8 and its chloroplast localization.
   - qRT-PCR analysis revealed the changes in the expression of genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and degradation, chloroplast development, senescence, and photosynthesis in the **CS3** mutant.
   - In this study, we isolated and characterized a chlorophyll-deficient mutant, which we named **CS3** (chlorotic seedling 3).
   - Using a map-based cloning strategy, we mapped the **CS3** gene, which encodes a Ycf54 domain-containing protein, to a locus on chromosome 3.
