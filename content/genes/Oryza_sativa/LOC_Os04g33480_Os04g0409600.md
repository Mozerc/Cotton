## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os04g33480](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g33480)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os04g0409600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os04g0409600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** DSL1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Some of the observed morphological defects were related to a reduction in cell numbers, in addition to reduced cell division in leaf primordia revealed by in situ hybridization analysis, suggesting the possibility that **DSL1** is involved in cell division control.
   - The mutant showed pleiotropic defects in both vegetative and reproductive development; for example, **DSL1** produced short and narrow leaves, accompanied with a reduction in the number and size of vascular bundles.
   - Inflorescence and spikelet development were also affected by the **DSL1** mutation.
   - Collectively, our study shows that the HDAC **DSL1** plays diverse and important roles in development in rice.
   - Gene cloning revealed that **DSL1** encodes an HDAC belonging to the Reduced potassium dependence3/Histone Deacetylase1 (RPD3/HDA1) family.
