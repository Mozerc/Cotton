- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (**PI3K**) has been reported to be important in normal plant growth and stress responses.
   - In this study, it was verified that **PI3K** played a vital role in rice seed germination through regulating NADPH oxidase activity.
   - Suppression of **PI3K** activity by inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 could abate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which resulted in disturbance to the seed germination.
   - Taken together, these data favored the novel conclusion that **PI3K** regulated NADPH oxidase activity through modulating the recruitment of Rac-1 to plasma membrane and accelerated the process of rice seed germination.
