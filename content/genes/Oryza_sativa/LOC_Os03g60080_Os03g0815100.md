## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, **SNAC1**, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C.
   - The expression of **OsNAC19** in rice leaves could be induced by the infection of blast fungus, and by application of exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ABA and ethylene but ethylene had a relatively weak induction effect.
   - The expression of gene **OsNAC19** was high in rice seedling roots, culms and blade sheathes, but its expression in rice leaves was low.
   - Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed OsSRO1c, was identified as a direct target gene of **SNAC1** (stress-responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response.
   - The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators **SNAC1** and DST.
   - The **SNAC1**-targeted gene OsSRO1c modulates stomatal closure and oxidative stress tolerance by regulating hydrogen peroxide in rice.
   - Such up-regulated genes that are commonly and specifically up-regulated in **OsNAC9** transgenic roots may account for the altered root architecture conferring increased drought resistance phenotype.
   - The overexpression of **OsNAC9** alters the root architecture of rice plants enhancing drought resistance and grain yield under field conditions.
   - Under drought conditions, RCc3:**OsNAC9** plants showed an increased grain yield of 28%-72%, whilst the GOS2:**OsNAC9** plants remained unchanged.
   - The aerenchyma of RCc3:**OsNAC9** roots was enlarged to a greater extent than those of GOS2:**OsNAC9** and non-transgenic (NT) roots, suggesting the importance of this phenotype for enhanced drought resistance.
   - Field evaluations over two cultivating seasons showed that grain yields of the RCc3:**OsNAC9** and the GOS2:**OsNAC9** plants were increased by 13%-18% and 13%-32% under normal conditions, respectively.
   - Here, we show that overexpression of stress responsive gene **SNAC1** (STRESS-RESPONSIVE NAC 1) significantly enhances drought resistance in transgenic rice (22-34% higher seed setting than control) in the field under severe drought stress conditions at the reproductive stage while showing no phenotypic changes or yield penalty.
   - The OsSKIPa-overexpressing rice showed significantly increased reactive oxygen species-scavenging ability and transcript levels of many stress-related genes, including **SNAC1** and rice homologs of CBF2, PP2C, and RD22, under drought stress conditions.
   - Our data suggest that **SNAC1** holds promising utility in improving drought and salinity tolerance in rice.
   - In this research, a full-length cDNA clone **OsNAC19** (Oryza sativa NAC19), encoding a novel NAC-domain protein, was isolated from a cDNA library prepared with rice leaves infected by incompatible race 131 of blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea).
   - **SNAC1** is induced predominantly in guard cells by drought and encodes a NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factor with transactivation activity.
   - Root-specific (RCc3) and constitutive (GOS2) promoters were used to overexpress **OsNAC9** and produced the transgenic RCc3:**OsNAC9** and GOS2:**OsNAC9** plants.
   - Interestingly, O-methyltransferase, a gene necessary for barrier formation, was specifically up-regulated only in the RCc3:**OsNAC9** roots.
   - Rice gene **OsNAC19** encodes a novel NAC-domain transcription factor and responds to infection by Magnaporthe grisea.
   - A stress-responsive NAC transcription factor gene **SNAC1** has been reported for its function in the positive regulation of drought resistance in rice, and several downstream **SNAC1** targets have been identified.
   - However, a complete regulatory network mediated by **SNAC1** in drought response remains unknown.
   - In this study, we performed Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq of **SNAC1**-overexpression transgenic rice (**SNAC1**-OE) lines and wild-type under normal and moderate drought stress conditions, to identify all **SNAC1** target genes at a genome-wide scale by RNA-Seq analyses.
   - **SNAC1** can bind to the OsbZIP23 promoter, an important ABA signaling regulator, and positively regulate the expression of several ABA signaling genes.
