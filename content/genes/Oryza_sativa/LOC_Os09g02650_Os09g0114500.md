## Functional Descriptions:
   - Therefore, **BC12**/GDD1, a kinesin-like protein with transcription regulation activity, mediates cell elongation by regulating the GA biosynthesis pathway in rice.
   - Mutation of rice **BC12**/GDD1, which encodes a kinesin-like protein that binds to a GA biosynthesis gene promoter, leads to dwarfism with impaired cell elongation.
   - Mitotic microtubule array comparison, flow cytometric analysis and expression assays of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes in root-tip cells showed that cell-cycle progression is affected in **BC12** mutants.
   - GDD1 was cloned by a map-based approach, was expressed constitutively, and was found to encode the kinesin-like protein BRITTLE CULM12 (**BC12**).
   - **BC12** mutants display dwarfism resulting from a significant reduction in cell number and brittleness due to an alteration in cellulose microfibril orientation and wall composition.
   - Here, we report the functional characterization of Brittle Culm12 (**BC12**), a gene encoding a kinesin-4 protein.
   - **BC12** is expressed mainly in tissues undergoing cell division and secondary wall thickening.
   - Therefore, **BC12** functions as a dual-targeting kinesin protein and is implicated in cell-cycle progression, cellulose microfibril deposition and wall composition in the monocot plant rice.
   - In this study we reveal that the novel **BC12**328Leu allele of **BC12** modulated plant leaf color in yd1 plants, which has not been previously reported in studies of **BC12**/GDD1/MTD1/SRG1.
   - We conclude that **LGW** regulates grain development by directly binding to the GW7 promoter and activating its expression.
   - Overexpression of **LGW** increased the grain length, indicating that **LGW** is a positive regulator for regulating grain length.
   - Elevating the GW7 expression levels in **LGW** plants rescued the small grain size phenotype.
   - Our findings revealed that **LGW** plays an important role in regulating grain size, and manipulation of this gene provides a new strategy for regulating grain weight in rice.
   - Protein sequence alignment analysis revealed that the mutation site was located at the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of LGW/**BC12**, resulting in the lgw protein not being located in the nucleus.
