## Functional Descriptions:
   - Novel alleles of rice **eIF4G** generated by CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis confer resistance to Rice tungro spherical virus.
   - To develop new sources of resistance to RTD, mutations in **eIF4G** were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the RTSV-susceptible variety IR64, widely grown across tropical Asia.
   - Among various mutated **eIF4G** alleles examined, only those resulting in in-frame mutations in SVLFPNLAGKS residues (mainly NL), adjacent to the YVV residues, conferred resistance.
   - Genome Editing of Rice **eIF4G** Loci Confers Partial Resistance to Rice Black-Streaked Dwarf Virus.
   - To develop novel resources for resistance to RBSDV through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, a guide RNA sequence targeting exon 1 of **eIF4G** was designed and cloned into a binary vector, pHUE401.
   - These results indicate that site-specific mutation of rice **eIF4G** successfully conferred partial resistance specific to RBSDV associated with less transcription of **eIF4G** in mutants.
   - However, the **eIF4G** mutant plants showed the same sensitivity to rice stripe virus (RSV) infection as wild-type plants.
