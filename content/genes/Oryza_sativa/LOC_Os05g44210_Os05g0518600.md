## Functional Descriptions:
   - To demonstrate the physiological function of **OsTPS1**, we introduced it into rice and found that **OsTPS1** overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes.
   - Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of **OsTPS1** showed that **OsTPS1** is inducible by drought, salt, cold, and ABA.
   - Leaves of **OsTPS1** knockout (KO) plants were more sensitive to drought or cold stress than were the wild types.
   - Characterization of a drought-responsive gene, **OsTPS1**, identified by the T-DNA gene-trap system in rice.
   - These results demonstrate that **OsTPS1** may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes.
   - Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene **OsTPS1** enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice.
   - Therefore, we propose that **OsTPS1** plays an important role during the abiotic stress response.
   - Furthermore, transgenic rice of UBI::CBF1 had high expression **OsTPS1** mRNA, suggesting that **OsTPS1** is regulated by the CBF/DREB transcription factor.
   - Further experiments demonstrated that the natural variation in the disease resistance level was associated with differential transcription of **OsTPS1** due to polymorphisms in its promoter.
   - We demonstrated that **OsTPS1** was regulated at the epigenetic level by JMJ705 through the methyl jasmonate pathway.
