## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PHD1** overexpression increased photosynthetic efficiency, biomass, and grain production, suggesting that **PHD1** plays an important role in supplying sufficient galactolipids to thylakoid membranes for proper chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic activity.
   - Downregulated expression of starch biosynthesis genes and upregulated expression of sucrose cleavage genes might be a result of reduced photosynthetic activity and account for the decreased starch and sucrose levels seen in **PHD1** leaves.
   - Molecular and biochemical analyses revealed that **PHD1** encodes a novel chloroplast-localized UDP-glucose epimerase (UGE), which is conserved in the plant kingdom.
   - The chloroplast localization of **PHD1** was confirmed by immunoblots, immunocytochemistry, and UGE activity in isolated chloroplasts, which was approximately 50% lower in the **PHD1**-1 mutant than in the wild type.
   - In addition, the amounts of UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose substrates in chloroplasts were significantly higher and lower, respectively, indicating that **PHD1** was responsible for a major part of UGE activity in plastids.
   - The relative amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), a major chloroplast membrane galactolipid, was decreased in the mutant, while the digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) amount was not significantly altered, suggesting that **PHD1** participates mainly in UDP-galactose supply for MGDG biosynthesis in chloroplasts.
   - The **PHD1** mutant showed decreased chlorophyll content, photosynthetic activity, and altered chloroplast ultrastructure, suggesting that a correct amount of galactoglycerolipids and the ratio of glycolipids versus phospholipids are necessary for proper chloroplast function.
   - To gain insight into genes controlling photosynthetic capacity, we selected from our large T-DNA mutant population a rice stunted growth mutant with decreased carbon assimilate and yield production named photoassimilate defective1 (**PHD1**).
