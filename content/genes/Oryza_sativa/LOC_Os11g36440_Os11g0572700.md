## Functional Descriptions:
   - The greatly increased activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, and reduced photosystem (PS) II core proteins CP43, CP47 and D1 in leaves of the **OsCRTISO**/phs3-1mutant and OsLCY RNAi transgenic rice indicated that photo-oxidative damage occurred in PS II, consistent with the accumulation of ROS in these plants.
   - Expression analysis via both RT-PCR and **ZEBRA2**-promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic rice indicates that **ZEBRA2** is predominantly expressed in mesophyll cells of mature leaves where active photosynthesis occurs.
   - More severe phenotype of the **ZEBRA2** mutant under high light intensity indicates that ""zebra"" phenotype might be caused by photooxidative damages.
   - We found that **MHZ5** encodes a carotenoid isomerase and that the mutation in **MHZ5** blocks carotenoid biosynthesis, reduces ABA accumulation, and promotes ethylene production in etiolated seedlings.
   - ABA can largely rescue the ethylene response of the **MHZ5** mutant.
   - Ethylene induces **MHZ5** expression, the production of neoxanthin, an ABA biosynthesis precursor, and ABA accumulation in roots.
   - **MHZ5** overexpression results in enhanced ethylene sensitivity in roots and reduced ethylene sensitivity in coleoptiles.
   - Prolycopene was accumulated while all-trans-lycopene was barely detectable in the dark-grown **MIT3** seedlings.
   - Exogenously applied GR24, a synthetic SL, could rescue the tillering phenotype of **MIT3**.
   - Our results reveal that the tillering phenotype of **MIT3** is due to SL deficiency and directly link carotenoid deficiency with SL-regulated rice tillering.
   - Mutations in the **MIT3** gene encoding a caroteniod isomerase lead to increased tiller number in rice..
   - Double mutant analysis of **MIT3** with the SLs biosynthesis mutant d17 revealed that **MIT3** controls tiller development upstream of the SLs biosynthesis pathway.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **MIT3** encodes a carotenoid isomerase (CRTISO), the key enzyme catalyzing the conversion from prolycopene to all-trans-lycopene in carotenoid biosynthesis.
