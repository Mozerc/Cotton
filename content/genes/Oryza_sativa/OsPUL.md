## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsPUL</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of the **OsPUL** gene was maintained at a significant level during the entire grain filling period and in the late stage of seed germination, which coincided with its involvement in starch anabolism and catabolism.
   - The **OsPUL** gene maintained a relatively high expression level during the entire period of seed development, and peaked in the middle and late stages.
   - Characterization of expression of the **OsPUL** gene encoding a pullulanase-type debranching enzyme during seed development and germination in rice.
   - In addition, the 1177-bp **OsPUL** promoter sequence was cloned, and some endosperm-specific motifs such as the GCN4 and AACA motifs were observed to exist in this region.
   - The data from both histochemical and fluorometric analyses showed that the **OsPUL** promoter was capable of driving the target gene to have a high level of endosperm-specific expression.
   - Furthermore, the seed germination experiment showed that the **OsPUL** promoter actively functions in the late stage of seed germination.
   - In the present study, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) analysis of the expression pattern of the **OsPUL** gene encoding a pullulanase-type DBE in different tissues as well as in seeds at different developmental stages.
