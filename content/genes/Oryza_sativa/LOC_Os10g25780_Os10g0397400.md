## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **BRD2** locus contains a single base deletion in the coding region of Dim/dwf1, a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana DIMINUTO/DWARF1 (DIM/DWF1).
   - Overproduction and repression of Dim/dwf1 resulted in contrasting phenotypes, with repressors mimicking the **BRD2** phenotype and overproducers having large stature with increased numbers of flowers and seeds.
   - The Rice brassinosteroid-deficient dwarf2 mutant, defective in the rice homolog of Arabidopsis **DIM**INUTO/DWARF1, is rescued by the endogenously accumulated alternative bioactive brassinosteroid, dolichosterone.
   - Based on these observations, we discuss an alternative BR biosynthetic pathway that produces DS when Dim/**DWF1** is defective.
   - **LHDD10** was constitutively expressed in various tissues, but more so in shoot apices and panicles.
   - We isolated **LHDD10** by map-based cloning; it encoded a putative FAD-linked oxidoreductase protein (a brassinosteroid biosynthetic gene) that localized to the nucleus.
   - In this study, we characterized a late heading, dwarf mutant known as **LHDD10** selected following ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treatment of ssp.
   - Brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthetic gene **LHDD10** controls late heading and plant height in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - Our data showed that **LHDD10** influences heading date by controlling the expression of heading date regulators, such as OsMADS50 in both LD and SD conditions.
   - The **LTBSG1** seedlings had a lower endogenous BR level and could be restored to the phenotype of wild type by exogenous BR.
   - This study demonstrated that **LTBSG1** could play a new role in regulating panicle and grain development by BR biosynthetic pathway.
   - In the present study, a mutant named **LTBSG1** (longer top branch and shorter grain 1) was isolated from the cultivar &amp;ldquo;Zhenong 34&amp;rdquo; (Oryza sativa L.
   - The histocytological analysis indicated that the elongated top branch and shorter grain of mutant **LTBSG1** were caused from the defects of cell elongation.
   - The **LTBSG1** knock-out lines showed similar phenotype defects as mutant **LTBSG1**, which confirmed that **LTBSG1** was responsible for top branch elongation and grain size reduction.
   - **LTBSG1** was constitutively expressed and the protein was widely localized in chloroplast, nucleus and cytomembrane.
   - The **LTBSG1** gene in mutant revealed a single nucleotide substitution (G-A) in the exon 2 of LOC_Os10g25780, causing an amino acid variation (Glycine-Arginine) in the FAD (Flavin-adenine dinucleotide)-binding domain of delta (24)-sterol reductase, which was involved in the brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis.
   - In summary, the current study has identified a new **BRD2** allele, which facilitated the further research on the molecular mechanism of this gene on regulating growth and development.
   - Natural variation of the **BRD2** allele affects plant height and grain size in rice..
   - The zqdm1 identified from a rice mutant is a novel allele of **BRD2** and is responsible for regulating rice plant height, grain size and appearance, which has possibilities on improving rice quality.
   - Complementation tests have confirmed that 369-bp insertion in **BRD2** was responsible for the plant height and grain size changing in the zqdm1 mutant.
   - Over-expression of **BRD2** driven by different promoters into indica rice variety Jiafuzhan (JFZ) results in slender grains, suggesting its function on regulating grain shape.
