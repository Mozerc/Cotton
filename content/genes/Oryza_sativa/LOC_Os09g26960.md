- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The breeding of japonica varieties with erect-pose panicle (**EP**) has recently progressed in the northern part of China, because these varieties exhibit a far higher grain yield than the varieties with normal-pose panicle (NP).
   - Experimental results showed that **EP** gene markedly enhanced grain yield, chiefly by increasing number of secondary branches and number of grains on the secondary branch.
   - Identification and characterization of the erect-pose panicle gene **EP** conferring high grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - **EP** gene also produced a remarkable increase in grain density.
   - Based on previous studies, map-based cloning of **EP** locus was conducted using Liaojing5, Toyonishiki, their F(2) population, and a pair of near-isogenic lines for **EP** locus (ZF14 and WF14) derived from the cross between the two varieties; consequently, the STS marker H90 was found to completely cosegregate with panicle pose.
