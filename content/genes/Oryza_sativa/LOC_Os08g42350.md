## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we show that **xa13**, a recessive allele conferring disease resistance against bacterial blight, one of the most devastating rice diseases worldwide, plays a key role in both disease resistance and pollen development.
   - The dominant allele, **xa13**, is required for both bacterial growth and pollen development.
   - The findings indicate that **Os8N3** is a host susceptibility gene for bacterial blight targeted by the type III effector PthXo1.
   - **Os8N3** is a host disease-susceptibility gene for bacterial blight of rice.
   - The recessive gene, **xa13**, confers resistance to Philippine race 6 (PXO99) of the bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae.
   - Genetic and physical mapping of **xa13** , a recessive bacterial blight resistance gene in rice.
   - These markers will be useful tools for the marker-assisted selection of **xa13** in breeding programs.
   - The recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene **xa13**, also involved in pollen development, has been cloned and its resistance mechanism has been recently characterized.
   - This report describes the conversion of bacterial blight resistance mediated by the recessive **xa13** gene into a dominant trait to facilitate its use in a breeding program.
   - Gene silencing using the recessive rice bacterial blight resistance gene **xa13** as a new paradigm in plant breeding.
   - To clone and characterize the recessive R genes, we fine-mapped **xa13**, a fully recessive gene for Xoo resistance, to a DNA fragment of 14.
   - Rice **xa13** recessive resistance to bacterial blight is defeated by induction of the disease susceptibility gene Os-11N3.
   - Targeting **xa13**, a recessive gene for bacterial blight resistance in rice.
   - Tissue-specific promoters were used to exclude most of the expression of artificial microRNA in the anther to ensure that **xa13** functioned normally during pollen development.
   - Representative pathotypes were used to evaluate seven near-isogenic lines carrying individual bacterial blight resistance genes (Xa3, Xa4, xa5, Xa7, Xa10, **xa13**, and Xa21) and gene pyramids.
   - Silencing of **Os8N3** by inhibitory RNA produced plants that were resistant to infection by strain PXO99(A) yet remained susceptible to other strains of the pathogen.
   - PXO99 causes rice disease by inducing **xa13**.
   - The recessive **xa13** allele represents a new type of plant disease resistance.
   - Essential Role of Sugar Transporter **OsSWEET11** during the Early Stage of Rice Grain Filling.
   - The knockout of **OsSWEET11** significantly decreased sucrose concentration in the mutant embryo-sacs and led to defective grain filling compared with that of the wild-type (WT) plant.
   - This study investigated the role of sugar transporter **OsSWEET11** during the early stage of rice caryopsis development using the Î²-glucoronidase (GUS)-represented expression, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout, cross-fertilization, and RNA-seq analyses.
   - These results strongly suggested that **OsSWEET11** played an important role in sucrose release from maternal tissue to the maternal-filial interface during the early stage of caryopsis development.
   - Inhibition of **OsSWEET11** function in mesophyll cells improves resistance of rice to sheath blight disease.
   - In this study, we found that the rice sugar transporter, **OsSWEET11** is involved in the pathogenesis of sheath blight disease.
   - The analyses of transgenic plants revealed that **OsSWEET11** mutants were less susceptible, whereas plants overexpressing **OsSWEET11** were more susceptible to sheath blight compared to wild-type controls, but the yield of **OsSWEET11** mutants and overexpressors was reduced.
   - To analyze whether inhibition of **OsSWEET11** function in mesophyll cells is related to defense against this disease, mutated- **OsSWEET11** was expressed under the control of Rubisco promoter, which is specific for green tissues.
   - The plants can be protected from infection by manipulating the expression of **OsSWEET11** without affecting the crop yield.
   - solani might acquire sugar from rice leaves by activating **OsSWEET11** expression.
   - CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis of **Os8N3** in rice to confer resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.
   - It has previously been reported that, in rice plants, knockdown of the **Os8N3** gene resulted in enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   - Analysis of the genotypes and edited **Os8N3** in T0, T1, T2, and T3 transgenic rice plants showed that the mutations were transmitted to subsequent generations, and homozygous mutants displayed significantly enhanced resistance to Xoo.
   - Homozygous (BC3F3 generation), three-gene bacterial blight pyramided (xa5 + **xa13** + Xa21) lines were developed, and these lines were crossed with Tetep to combine blast (Pi54) and sheath blight (qSBR7-1, qSBR11-1, and qSBR11-2) resistance.
   - In BC3F3 generation, the improved pyramided lines carrying a total of seven genes/QTLs (xa5 + **xa13** + Xa21 + Pi54 + qSBR7-1 + qSBR11-1 + qSBR11-2) were selected through molecular and phenotypic assay, and these were evaluated for resistance against bacterial blight, blast, and sheath blight pathogens under greenhouse conditions.
   - Both OsSWEET14 and **OsSWEET11** exhibited distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns between the early stage of caryopsis development and the rapid grain-filling stage.
   - OsSWEET14 cooperates with **OsSWEET11** to contribute to grain filling in rice.
   - ossweet14 knockout mutants did not show any detectable phenotypic differences from the wild type, whereas ossweet14;**OsSWEET11** double-knockout mutants had much more severe phenotypes than **OsSWEET11** single-knockout mutants, including strongly reduced grain weight and yield, reduced grain-filling rate, and increased starch accumulation in the pericarp.
   - During the rapid grain-filling stage, OsSWEET14 and **OsSWEET11** localized to four key sites: vascular parenchyma cells, the nucellar projection, the nucellar epidermis, and cross cells.
   - These results indicate that both OsSWEET15 and **OsSWEET11** play important and similar roles in rice pollen development, caryopsis formation and seed-setting, in addition to their function in seed-filling that was demonstrated previously.
