- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we found a limiting factor of RSA--**OsARF12**--an auxin response factor whose knockout led to decreased primary root length in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - * The root elongation zones of **OsARF12** and **OsARF12**/25, which had lower auxin concentrations, were distinctly shorter than for the wild-type, possibly as a result of decreased expression of auxin synthesis genes OsYUCCAs and auxin efflux carriers OsPINs and OsPGPs.
   - The knockout of **OsARF12** also altered the abundance of mitochondrial iron-regulated (OsMIR), iron (Fe)-regulated transporter1 (OsIRT1) and short postembryonic root1 (OsSPR1) in roots of rice, and resulted in lower Fe content.
   - * The data provide evidence for the biological function of **OsARF12**, which is implicated in regulating root elongation.
   - **OsARF12**, a transcription activator on auxin response gene, regulates root elongation and affects iron accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Transcript analysis revealed that Pi-responsive genes--Phosphate starvation (OsIPS)1 and OsIPS2, SYG1/Pho81/XPR1(OsSPX1), Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol 2 (OsSQD2), R2R3 MYB transcription factor (OsMYB2P-1) and Transport Inhibitor Response1 (OsTIR1)--were more abundant in the **OsARF12** and **OsARF12**/25 mutants under +Pi/-Pi conditions.
   - Auxin response factor (**OsARF12**), a novel regulator for phosphate homeostasis in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Here, we report that an auxin response factor, **OsARF12**, functions in Pi homeostasis.
   - Results from -Pi/1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) treatments, and auxin reporter DR5::GUS staining suggest that root system alteration and Pi-induced auxin response were at least partially controlled by **OsARF12**.
   - * **OsARF12** as a transcription activator can facilitate the expression of the auxin response element DR5::GFP, and **OsARF12** was inhibited by osa-miRNA167d by transient expression in tobacco and rice callus.
   - These findings enrich our understanding of the biological functions of **OsARF12**, which also acts in regulating Pi homeostasis.
   - Measurement of element content, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis and acid phosphatases (APases) activity assay showed that the **OsARF12** mutant and **OsARF12**/25 double mutant with P-intoxicated phenotypes had higher P concentrations, up-regulation of the Pi transporter encoding genes and increased APase activity under Pi-sufficient/-deficient (+Pi/-Pi, 0.
   - Strikingly, our genetic data showed that loss-of-function mutants of **OsARF12** or osarf16 exhibit reduced resistance whereas osarf11 mutants display enhanced resistance to RDV.
   - In turn, **OsARF12** activates the down-stream OsWRKY13 expression through direct binding to its promoter, loss-of-function mutants of oswrky13 exhibit reduced resistance.
   - miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.
   - Further analysis indicates that **OsARF12** is the major mediator of miR167 in regulating rice grain filling.
   - Expectedly, over expressing **OsARF12** could resemble the phenotype of STTM/MIM167 plants with respect to grain weight and grain filling rate.
   - Flow cytometric analysis in young panicles of plants overexpressing **OsARF12** and cell number examination of cdkf;2 mutants verify that **OsARF12** positively regulates grain filling and grain size by targeting OsCDKF;2.
   - Additionally, plants overexpressing **OsARF12** or cdkf;2 mutants present enhanced or reduced sensitivity to exogenous auxin and brassinosteroid (BR) treatments, confirming that OsCDKF;2 targeting by **OsARF12** mediates auxin and BR signaling.
