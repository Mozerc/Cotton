## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os10g40640](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g40640)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os10g0555100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os10g0555100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsGGT
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The accumulation of **OsGGT** mRNA in FR13A also increased in response to ethylene, gibberellin, abscisic acid, drought and salt treatment, but methyl jasmonate treatment and cold stress had no effect on expression.
   - A submergence-induced gene, **OsGGT**, was cloned from 7-day submerged rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - A time-course study showed that **OsGGT**-gene expression increased in FR13A during submergence but decreased in IR42 (submergence-intolerant cultivar, Indica).
   - These results suggest that the **OsGGT** gene could be related to submergence stress and associated with a general defensive response to various environmental stresses.
   - Identification and cloning of a submergence-induced gene **OsGGT** (glycogenin glucosyltransferase) from rice (Oryza sativa L.) by suppression subtractive hybridization.
   - The expression of the **OsGGT** gene in FR13A was induced by salicylic acid and benzyladenine.
