## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os01g55974](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os01g55974)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0765000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0765000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** ST2,OsDCD,ALR
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Subcellular localization assay showed that the **ST2** protein was located in mitochondria.
   - The **ST2** gene was finely confined to a 27-kb region on chromosome 1 by the map-based cloning strategy and a 5-bp deletion in Os01g0765000 was identified by sequence analysis.
   - The expression of nuclear and plastid genome replication genes was down-regulated under decreased dTTP, and together with decreased cell proliferation and defective chloroplast development in the **ALR** mutant this demonstrated the molecular and physiological roles of DCD-mediated dNTP pool balance in plant development.
   - **ALR** encoding dCMP deaminase is critical for DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression and plant development in rice..
   - Map-based cloning and complementation revealed that **ALR** encodes a DCD protein.
