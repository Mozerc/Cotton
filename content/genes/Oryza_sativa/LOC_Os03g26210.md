## Functional Descriptions:
   - RESULTS: Transcript abundance of one nuclear located basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor, **OsIRO3**, is up-regulated from 25- to 90-fold under Fe deficiency in both root and shoot respectively.
   - CONCLUSION: A novel Fe regulated bHLH transcription factor (**OsIRO3**) that plays an important role for Fe homeostasis in rice was identified.
   - Furthermore, the Fe concentration in shoots of transgenic rice plants over-expressing **OsIRO3** was less than that in wild-type plants.
   - **OsIRO3** is expressed in the roots, leaves, and base nodes, with a higher level in leaf blades at the vegetative growth stage.
   - Knockout of **OsIRO3** resulted in a hypersensitivity to Fe deficiency, with severe necrosis on young leaves and defective root development.
   - **OsIRO3** Plays an Essential Role in Iron Deficiency Responses and Regulates Iron Homeostasis in Rice.
   - However, the molecular mechanisms by which **OsIRO3** regulate Fe homeostasis is unclear.
   - Here, we report that **OsIRO3** is essential for responding to Fe deficiency and maintaining Fe homeostasis in rice.
   - Thus, we conclude that **OsIRO3** plays a key role in responding to Fe deficiency and regulates NA levels by directly, negatively regulating the OsNAS3 expression.
   - A Model to Incorporate the bHLH Transcription Factor **OsIRO3** within the Rice Iron Homeostasis Regulatory Network.
   - We place our results in the context of the existing literature and generate a model describing the role of **OsIRO3** in rice Fe homeostasis and reinforce the essential function of **OsIRO3** in the rice Fe deficiency response.
   - Further analysis revealed that **OsIRO3** directly regulated the expression of IRON-RELATED BHLH TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 2 (OsIRO2), which encodes a positive regulator of the Fe uptake system.
   - Loss-of-function of **OsIRO3** caused upregulation of Fe deficiency-associated genes in the root.
   - **OsIRO3** negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2.
   - Further investigation demonstrated that **OsIRO3** interacted with POSITIVE REGULATOR OF IRON HOMEOSTASIS 1(OsPRI1) and OsPRI2, and.
   - This work sheds light on the molecular mechanism by which **OsIRO3** modulates Fe homeostasis in rice.
   - **OsIRO3** negatively regulates Fe homeostasis by repressing the expression of OsIRO2.
