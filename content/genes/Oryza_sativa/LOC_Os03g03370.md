## Functional Descriptions:
   - To identify critical genes for drought resistance in rice (Oryza sativa), we screened T-DNA mutants and identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant, **DSM2**.
   - The amounts of zeaxanthin and ABA were significantly reduced in two allelic **DSM2** mutants after drought stress compared with the wild type.
   - Overexpression of **DSM2** in rice resulted in significantly increased resistance to drought and oxidative stresses and increases of the xanthophylls and nonphotochemical quenching.
   - We conclude that the **DSM2** gene significantly contributes to control of the xanthophyll cycle and ABA synthesis, both of which play critical roles in the establishment of drought resistance in rice.
   - Characterization of the beta-carotene hydroxylase gene **DSM2** conferring drought and oxidative stress resistance by increasing xanthophylls and abscisic acid synthesis in rice.
   - **DSM2** is a chloroplast protein, and the response of **DSM2** to environmental stimuli is distinctive from the other two BCH members in rice.
