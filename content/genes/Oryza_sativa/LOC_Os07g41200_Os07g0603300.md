## Functional Descriptions:
   - OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the **GW7** promoter and repressed its expression.
   - Upregulation of **GW7** expression was correlated with the production of more slender grains, as a result of increased cell division in the longitudinal direction and decreased cell division in the transverse direction.
   - Copy number variation at the **GL7** locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice..
   - 1-kb segment at the **GL7** locus leads to upregulation of **GL7** and downregulation of its nearby negative regulator, resulting in an increase in grain length and improvement of grain appearance quality.
   - Sequence analysis indicates that allelic variants of **GL7** and its negative regulator are associated with grain size diversity and that the CNV at the **GL7** locus was selected for and used in breeding.
   - **GL7** encodes a protein homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana LONGIFOLIA proteins, which regulate longitudinal cell elongation.
   - Our work suggests that pyramiding beneficial alleles of **GL7** and other yield- and quality-related genes may improve the breeding of elite rice varieties.
   - Natural Variations in **SLG7** Regulate Grain Shape in Rice..
   - The **SLG7** allele from Azucena produces longer and thinner grains, while has no influence on grain weight and yield production.
   - Our findings show that the functions of **SLG7** family members are conserved across monocots and dicots, and the **SLG7** allele could be applied in breeding to modify rice grain appearance.
   - Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that **SLG7** produces slender grains by longitudinally increasing cell length, while transversely decreasing cell width, which is independent from cell division.
   - **SLG7** is constitutively expressed in various tissues in rice, and the **SLG7** protein is located in plasma membrane.
   - Development of a specific molecular marker for **SLG7** on high-quality rice breeding..
   - The **SLG7** gene is a novel gene responsible for slender grain shape in rice.
   - The accessions, which possessed the **SLG7** allele with 11-bp deletion in the promoter region, had longer grain length and better quality.
   - Here, we recommend the use of the simple, inexpensive assay for routine genotyping of slender grain and lower chalkiness in the breeding population for discrimination of **SLG7** genotype in rice germplasm.
