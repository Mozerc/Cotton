- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os09g0571200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os09g0571200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsC2DP
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knockout of **OsC2DP** did not affect Na+ concentration in the roots, but increased shoot Na+ concentration, resulting in a significant sensitivity of rice to salt stress.
   - Here, we reported a novel C2 domain-containing protein, **OsC2DP** required for salt tolerance in rice.
   - **OsC2DP** was predominately expressed in the roots and its expression was repressed by salt stress.
   - Immunostaining further showed that **OsC2DP** was able to translocate from the cytosol to plasma membrane under salt conditions.
   - These results indicate that **OsC2DP** has an important role in salt tolerance and these findings provide new insights into the regulation of **OsC2DP** gene for rice breeding with high salt tolerance.
   - **OsC2DP** is a cytosolic protein containing a C2 domain recently identified in rice, which is translocated to the plasma membrane in response to salt stress.
   - These results indicated that the subcellular localization was determined by C2 domain of **OsC2DP** under normal conditions and that both N- and C-terminus of **OsC2DP** are essential for its cytosol-plasma membrane translocation in response to salt stress.
