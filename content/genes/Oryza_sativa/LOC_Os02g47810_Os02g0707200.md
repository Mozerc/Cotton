## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice Transcription Factor **OsDOF11** Modulates Sugar Transport by Promoting Expression of Sucrose Transporter and SWEET genes..
   - Although sucrose enhanced root elongation in young wild-type (WT) seedlings, this did not occur in **OsDOF11** seedlings due to reduced sucrose uptake.
   - Sugar transport rate analyses revealed that less sugar was transported in **OsDOF11** plants than in the WT.
   - We also observed that **OsDOF11** mutant plants were less susceptible to infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pathovar oryzae, suggesting that **OsDOF11** participates in sugar distribution during pathogenic invasions.
   - Collectively, these results suggest that **OsDOF11** modulates sugar transport by regulating expression of SUT and SWEET genes in rice.
   - Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that **OsDOF11** directly binds to the promoter regions of SUT1, OsSWEET11, and OsSWEET14, indicating that **OsDOF11** coordinately controls transporters that are responsible for sucrose transport via apoplastic loading.
   - **OsDOF11** Affects Nitrogen Metabolism by Sucrose Transport Signaling in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - Here, we note that **OsDOF11** promotes nitrogen uptake and then maintains the ratio of fresh weight to dry weight in seedling plants and the effective leaf blade at flowering stages.
   - Both sugar and organic nitrogen changes caused the ratio of fresh weight to dry weight to decrease in **OsDOF11** mutant seedling plants and mature leaves, which might result in vigorous reduced metabolic activity and become less susceptible to stress.
   - These results demonstrated that **OsDOF11** affected nitrogen metabolism by sugar distribution in rice, which provided new insight that **OsDOF11** coordinated with C and N balance to maintain plant growth activity.
   - Mutants of the sucrose transporter gene OsSWEET14 displayed a phenotype similar to that of **OsDOF11**.
   - The sucrose transport regulator **OsDOF11** mediates cytokinin degradation during rice development..
   - Here, we found that **OsDOF11** loss-of-function mutants showed a semi-dwarf phenotype with a smaller cell length due to increased cytokinin content in source tissues.
   - RNA sequencing and reverse transcription quantitative PCR analyses revealed that genes involved in cytokinin signaling and metabolism were affected in **OsDOF11** mutants.
   - sativa VIN3-LIKE 2 caused an increase in active cytokinin levels and induced **OsDOF11** transcript levels.
   - We note that the loss function of **OsDOF11** displays the reduced crown roots number, low activity of nitrogen assimilation and low content of cytokinin and auxin.
   - **OsDOF11** Promotes Crown Root Formation via Cytokinin in Oryza Sativa..
   - RESULTS: We demonstrate the role of **OsDOF11** in root development.
   - 0% sucrose (MS30) by **OsDOF11** in rice root.
   - CONCLUSIONS: **OsDOF11** promotes crown root formation via cytokinin in oryza sativa.
   - These results provide a physiological basis for further analysis of the **OsDOF11** function of in rice root development.
   - Exogenous application of cytokinin and [13C] sucrose labeled stable isotope uptake experiments help us to explain the relationship between **OsDOF11** and cytokinin.
