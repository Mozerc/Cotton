- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0302200](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0302200)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsHIRP1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcription of the **OsHIRP1** was upregulated in response to heat and drought treatment.
   - **OsHIRP1** is an E3 ligase that acts as a positive regulator in the plant response to heat stress, thus providing important information relating to adaptation and regulation under heat stress in plant.
   - Two interacting partners, OsARK4 and OsHRK1, were identified via yeast-two-hybrid screening, which were mainly targeted to the nucleus (OsARK4) and cytosol (OsHRK1), and their interactions with **OsHIRP1** were confirmed by biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC).
