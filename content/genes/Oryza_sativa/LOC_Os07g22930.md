- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OsGBSSII</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsGBSSII** was mainly expressed in leaves and its protein was exclusively bound to starch granules in rice leaves, which suggests that the amylose in rice leaves is synthesized by **OsGBSSII**.
   - N-starvation-induced expression of **OsGBSSII** could be repressed by supplying nitrate, ammonia or amino acid (glutamic acid or glutamine), glucosamine (an inhibitor of hexokinase) or dark conditions.
   - 21) was cloned and defined as **OsGBSSII** based on a Nitrogen (N)-starvation-induced cDNA library constructed using the rapid subtraction hybridization method.
