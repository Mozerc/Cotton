## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os07g43010](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os07g43010)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** None  
- **Gene Symbol:** DTM1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in **DTM1** anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis.
   - However, expression of MSP1 and MEL1, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the **DTM1** mutant.
   - Moreover, transcripts of **DTM1** were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants.
   - Here we identified a rice gene, DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (**DTM1**), which controls the early stages of that development.
   - These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that **DTM1** plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1.
   - The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (**DTM1**) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis.
   - RNA in-situ hybridization analyses showed that **DTM1** transcripts were most abundant in tapetal cells at stages 6 and 7, and moderately in the pollen mother cells and meiocytes.
