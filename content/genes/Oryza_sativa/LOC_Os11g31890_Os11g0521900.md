- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Loss of **OsCPL3** function resulted in higher OsGSK2 abundance and lower OsBZR1 levels, leading to decreased BR responsiveness and alterations in plant morphology including semi-dwarfism, leaf erectness and grain size, which are of fundamental importance to crop productivity.
   - **OsCPL3** localized to the nucleus, where it dephosphorylated OsGSK2 at the Ser-222 and Thr-284 residues to modulate its protein turnover and kinase activity, in turn affecting the degradation of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and BR signaling.
   - **OsCPL3** is involved in brassinosteroid signaling by regulating OsGSK2 stability..
   - **OsCPL3** expression was widely detected in various tissues and organs including roots, leaves and lamina joints, and was induced by exogenous BR treatment.
   - These results reveal a previously unrecognized role for **OsCPL3** and add another layer of complexity to the tightly controlled BR signaling pathway in plants.
