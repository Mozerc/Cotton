## Functional Descriptions:
   - The WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene **WOX11** is required to activate shoot-borne crown root development in rice.
   - Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results showed that expression levels of WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, **WOX11**, and some flowering regulators were promoted in the OsMADS15 overexpression transgenic plants, indicating that OsMADS15 had a wide range of regulations.
   - In this work, we show that a WUSCHEL-related Homeobox (WOX) gene, **WOX11**, is involved in the activation of crown root emergence and growth.
   - The expressions of auxin- and cytokinin-responsive genes were affected in **WOX11** overexpression and RNA interference transgenic plants.
   - The results suggest that **WOX11** may be an integrator of auxin and cytokinin signaling that feeds into RR2 to regulate cell proliferation during crown root development.
   - **WOX11** was found to be expressed in emerging crown roots and later in cell division regions of the root meristem.
   - Further analysis showed that **WOX11** directly repressed RR2, a type-A cytokinin-responsive regulator gene that was found to be expressed in crown root primordia.
   - Here, we report that ectopic expression of **WOX11** gene driven by the promoter of OsHAK16 encoding a low-K-enhanced K transporter led to an extensive root system and adventitious roots and more effective tiller numbers in rice.
   - The results suggest that enlarging root growth and development by the expression of **WOX11** in roots could provide a useful option for increasing K acquisition efficiency and cereal crop productivity in low K soil.
   - The Interaction between Rice ERF3 and **WOX11** Promotes Crown Root Development by Regulating Gene Expression Involved in Cytokinin Signaling.
   - However, the nature of **WOX11** function in crown root development has remained elusive.
   - Here, we identified a rice AP2/ERF protein, ERF3, which interacts with **WOX11** and was expressed in crown root initials and during crown root growth.
   - Downregulation of ERF3 in **WOX11** mutants produced a more severe root phenotype.
   - The expression of ERF3 and **WOX11** only partially overlapped, underlining a spatio-temporal control of RR2 expression and crown root development.
   - WUSCHEL-related homeobox gene **WOX11** increases rice drought resistance by controlling root hair formation and root system development.
   - In this study, we further analyzed the root phenotypes of **WOX11** transgenic plants and revealed that **WOX11** also actes in controlling root hair development and enhancing rice drought resistance, in addition to its roles in regulating crown root and lateral root development.
   - Based on this new finding, we proposed the mechanism of that **WOX11** is involved in drought resistance by modulating rice root system development.
   - Rice Homeodomain Protein **WOX11** Recruits a Histone Acetyltransferase Complex to Establish Programs of Cell Proliferation of Crown Root Meristem.
   - Previous work has shown that the Wuschel-related homeobox gene **WOX11** is necessary and sufficient to promote rice (Oryza sativa) crown root emergence and elongation.
   - Here, we show that **WOX11** recruits the ADA2-GCN5 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) module to activate downstream target genes in crown root meristem.
   - **WOX11** and ADA2-GCN5 commonly target and regulate a set of root-specific genes involved in energy metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, and hormone response, some of which are known to be important for root development.
   - The results indicate that the recruitment of ADA2-GCN5 by **WOX11** establishes gene expression programs of crown root meristem cell division and suggest that permissive chromatin modification involving histone acetylation is a strategy for **WOX11** to stimulate root meristem development.
   - Transcriptional regulatory network of **WOX11** is involved in the control of crown root development, cytokinin signals, and redox in rice.
   - In addition to specifically activating crown root development, **WOX11** is also involved in lateral root initiation, root hair formation, and abiotic stresses.
   - Here, we studied the transcriptome of **WOX11** root tips by RNA-Seq and determined direct **WOX11**-binding targets by bioinformatic and biochemical analysis.
   - The analysis identified several genes that acted downstream of **WOX11** in controlling crown root formation, cytokinin signaling, stress response, and redox metabolism.
   - This work built a hierarchical regulatory model of **WOX11** in rice crown root development.
   - The results suggest that recruitment of JMJ705 to specific developmental pathway genes is promoted by DNA-binding transcription factors and that **WOX11** functions to stimulate shoot growth through epigenetic reprogramming of genes involved in meristem development and energy-generating pathways.
   - Genetic analysis indicates that **WOX11** and JMJ705 cooperatively control shoot growth and commonly regulate the expression of a set of genes involved in meristem identity, chloroplast biogenesis, and energy metabolism in the shoot apex.
   - **WOX11** recruits a histone H3K27me3 demethylase to promote gene expression during shoot development in rice.
   - Here, we show that **WOX11** interacts with the H3K27me3 demethylase JMJ705 to activate gene expression during shoot development in rice.
   - We find that YUC overexpression-induced crown root proliferation requires the presence of the transcription factor **WOX11**.
   - Auxin activates **WOX11** transcription, which subsequently drives crown root initiation and development, establishing the YUC-Auxin-**WOX11** module for crown root development in rice.
   - Moreover, the crown rootless phenotype of taa1 mutants was partially rescued by overexpression of **WOX11**.
   - A Non-canonical MITE in **WOX11** Promoter is Associated With Robust Crown Root in Rice.
   - As an important regulator of rice crown root development, **WOX11** is essential for crown root formation and its transcript level is positively correlated with crown roots biomass.
   - However, how **WOX11** is regulated during crown root primordium emergence and outgrowth still remains unknown.
   - Furthermore, p**WOX11**(ncMITE+):**WOX11**-FLAG in **WOX11** background could complement crown root number and length compared to those of wild type (WT), while p**WOX11**(ncMITE-):**WOX11**-FLAG could not.
   - This work provides novel insight into **WOX11** expression regulation and reveals a promising target for genetic improvement of root architecture in rice.
   - Analysis of **WOX11** promoter driven reporter gene GUS (Î²-glucuronidase) transgenic plants p**WOX11**(ncMITE+):GUS and p**WOX11**(ncMITE-):GUS uncovered higher GUS expression level in crown roots of p**WOX11**(ncMITE+):GUS plants.
   - These results suggested that the ncMITE was positively associated **WOX11** transcripts in rice crown roots.
   - RESULTS: We demonstrated that **WOX11** was required to maintain ROS homeostasis by upregulating peroxidase genes in the crown root meristem.
   - Finally, acetylproteomic analysis of wild type and **WOX11** roots treated with or without potassium iodide (KI) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was used to study the effects of ROS on protein acetylation in rice CR cells.
   - **WOX11** and CRL1 act synergistically to promote crown root development by maintaining cytokinin homeostasis in rice.
   - Eletrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transient expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) suggested that **WOX11** and CRL1 directly bind to OsCKX4 to regulate its expression during crown root development.
   - CRL1 enhances OsCKX4 activation through direct interaction with **WOX11** at root emergence and elongation stages.
   - Increased expression of OsCKX4 could partially complement the crown root phenotypes of both crl1 and **WOX11** mutants.
   - Furthermore, cytokinin can promote **WOX11** protein accumulation in root meristem.
   - Importantly, these results reveal an intrinsic link between **WOX11** protein accumulation and cytokinin to maintain crown root growth.
   - Transcription factor **WOX11** regulates protein translation via ribosome protein acetylation in rice roots.
