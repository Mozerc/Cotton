## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **OsGLP2-1** quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast, panicle blast and bacterial blight.
   - The germin-like protein **OsGLP2-1** enhances resistance to fungal blast and bacterial blight in rice.
   - In addition to its resistance to blast and bacterial blight, **OsGLP2-1** has also been reported to co-localize with a QTLs for sheath blight resistance in rice.
   - These suggest that the disease resistance provided by **OsGLP2-1** is quantitative and broad spectrum.
   - Together, these results suggest that **OsGLP2-1** functions as a positive regulator to modulate disease resistance.
   - Moreover, **OsGLP2-1** was significantly induced by jasmonic acid (JA).
   - Higher endogenous level of JA was also identified in **OsGLP2-1** overexpressing plants than in control plants both before and after pathogen inoculation.
   - Compared with empty vector transformed (control) plants, the **OsGLP2-1** overexpressing plants exhibited higher levels of H2O2 both before and after pathogen inoculation.
   - Overexpression of **OsGLP2-1** induced three well-characterized defense-related genes which are associated in JA-dependent pathway after pathogen infection.
   - We provide evidence that **OsGLP2-1** is antagonistically controlled at the transcriptional level by ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) and GAMYB transcription factors.
   - We conclude that **OsGLP2-1** acts as a buffer, maintaining appropriate equilibrium for the regulation of primary dormancy during seed development in rice.
   - Conversely, overexpression of **OsGLP2-1** driven by the **OsGLP2-1** native promoter led to greater seed dormancy.
   - Seed scutellum-specific expression of **OsGLP2-1** was increased by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but decreased with gibberellic acid (GA) treatment.
   - Using artificial microRNA (miRNA) and CRISPR/CAS9 approaches, suppression of **OsGLP2-1** expression in rice resulted in the release of dormancy in immature seeds.
