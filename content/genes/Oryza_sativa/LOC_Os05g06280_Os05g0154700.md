## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and **SRS3**, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants.
   - The causal gene of a novel small and round seed mutant phenotype (**SRS3**) in rice was identified by map-based cloning and named the **SRS3** gene.
   - Using scanning electron microscopy, we determined that the cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction in **SRS3** is shorter than that in the wild type.
   - The number of cells of seeds in the longitudinal direction in **SRS3** was not very different from that in the wild type.
   - The result suggests that the small and round seed phenotype of **SRS3** is due to a reduction in cell length of seeds in the longitudinal direction.
   - Thus, our results suggest that **OsKINESIN-13A** utilizes its microtubule depolymerization activity to promote microtubule turnover, which may not only influence transverse orientation of cortical microtubules but also facilitate vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, and thus affects cellulose microfibril orientation and cell elongation.
   - **OsKINESIN-13A** Is an Active Microtubule Depolymerase Involved in Glume Length Regulation via Affecting Cell Elongation..
   - An EMS-induced new sequence variant, TEMS5032, in the coding region of **SRS3** gene leads to shorter grain length in rice (Oryza sativa L.)..
   - In the present study, we characterized and mapped a short and bold grained mutant and named it as TEMS5032, as the mutant is a result of EMS-induced transition from C to T at the 5032nd bp of **SRS3** gene, which is known to affect grain size in rice.
   - **BHS1** was down-regulated at RNA and protein level upon exogenous BR treatment, and proteasome inhibitor MG132 delayed the **BHS1** degradation, indicating that both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation machineries are involved in **BHS1**-mediated regulation of plant growth and development.
   - **BHS1** encodes the kinesin-13a protein and regulates grain length.
   - We found that **BHS1** was hypersensitive to BR, while **BHS1**-overexpression was less sensitive to BR compare to WT.
   - Together, these results suggest that **BHS1** is a novel component which is involved in negative regulation of the BR signaling downstream player of BRI1.
