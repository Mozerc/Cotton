## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Pb1** encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NB-LRR) protein and confers durable, broad-spectrum resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae races.
   - Panicle blast 1 (**Pb1**) is a blast-resistance gene derived from the indica cultivar 'Modan'.
   - **Pb1**-mediated resistance, which is characterized by durability of resistance and adult/panicle blast resistance, has been introduced into elite varieties for commercial cultivation.
   - We discuss possible determinants for the durability of **Pb1**-mediated blast resistance.
   - Durable panicle blast-resistance gene **Pb1** encodes an atypical CC-NBS-LRR protein and was generated by acquiring a promoter through local genome duplication.
   - Panicle blast 1 (**Pb1**) is a panicle blast resistance gene derived from the indica rice cultivar Modan.
   - Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying **Pb1**-mediated blast resistance.
   - **Pb1**-mediated panicle blast resistance was largely compromised when WRKY45 was knocked down in a **Pb1**-containing rice cultivar.
   - Leaf-blast resistance by **Pb1** overexpression (**Pb1**-ox) was also compromised in WRKY45 knockdown/**Pb1**-ox rice.
   - Blast infection induced higher accumulation of WRKY45 in **Pb1**-ox than in control Nipponbare rice.
   - Overexpression of **Pb1**-Quad, a coiled-coil domain mutant that had weak interaction with WRKY45, resulted in significantly weaker blast resistance than that of wild-type **Pb1**.
   - Overexpression of **Pb1** with a nuclear export sequence failed to confer blast resistance to rice.
   - These results suggest that the blast resistance of **Pb1** depends on its interaction with WRKY45 in the nucleus.
   - In a transient system using rice protoplasts, coexpression of **Pb1** enhanced WRKY45 accumulation and increased WRKY45-dependent transactivation activity, suggesting that protection of WRKY45 from ubiquitin proteasome system degradation is possibly involved in **Pb1**-dependent blast resistance.
   - Blast resistance of CC-NB-LRR protein **Pb1** is mediated by WRKY45 through protein-protein interaction.
   - Based on the cosegregation of the resistant genotypes of **Pb1** and Stvb-i, a rice stripe virus (RSV) resistance gene derived from an Indica cultivar Modan, we examined the linkage relationships between **Pb1** and 13 Stvb-i-linked RFLP markers located on the long arm of chromosome 11.
   - **Pb1** transcript levels increased during the development of **Pb1**+ cultivars; this expression pattern accounts for their adult/panicle resistance.
   - The **Pb1** protein interacted with WRKY45, a transcription factor involved in induced resistance via the salicylic acid signaling pathway that is regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system.
   - We precisely mapped the **Pb1** locus for the panicle blast resistence of a quantitative nature on rice chromosome 11 using RFLP markers.
   - Identification of a RFLP Marker Tightly Linked to the Panicle Blast Resistance Gene, **Pb1**, in Rice.
   - **Pb1** is classified as a quantitative resistance gene and it does not have fungal specificity.
   - Mapping of QTL related to Chr7 confirmed the existence of factors that were required for the resistance of **Pb1** in the 22 to 23 Mbp region of the rice genome.
   - We clarified how the K209 cultivar is vulnerable to the blast disease despite possessing **Pb1** and found the DNA marker responsible for the quantitative resistance of **Pb1**.
   - We found that the expression of WRKY45 gene downstream of **Pb1** was weakly induced by rice blast inoculation at the full heading stage in K209.
