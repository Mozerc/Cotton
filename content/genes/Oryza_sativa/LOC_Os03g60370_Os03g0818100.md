## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g60370](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g60370)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0818100](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0818100)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsPHY2
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Prokaryotic expressed **OsPHY2** has a strong function on degradation of phytate, with optimal temperature of 47Â°C and optimal pH of 3.
   - Under the guidance of patatin signal peptide (PSP) of potato, the **OsPHY2** expressed in tobacco could be secreted by the rhizosphere and hydrolyze the phytate into Pi, leading to a significantly more inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulated and growth improved in plants under the condition using phytate as the sole phosphorus source.
   - During the seed germination, the transcripts of **OsPHY2** were much more detected in the germinated seeds than in the primary roots and the leaves.
   - Therefore, as one HAP type of the phytase genes, **OsPHY2** plays a critical role on the degradation of the phytins during the seed germination and has a potential application on the generation of elite crop germplasms with high use of efficiency of phytate and a large quantity of organic phosphate compounds in the arable land.
   - **OsPHY2** contains HP_HAP_like domain, a 24-aa signal peptide at the N-terminal and was targeted to the cytoplasm membrane after ER sorted.
