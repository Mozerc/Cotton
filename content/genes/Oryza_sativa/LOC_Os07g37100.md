## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **OsENT2** promoter drove the expression of the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene in the scutellum during germination and in vascular tissues in germinated plants, suggesting a participation of **OsENT2** in the retrieval of endosperm-derived nucleosides by the germinating embryo and in the long-distance transport of nucleosides in growing plants, respectively.
   - **OsENT2**-mediated adenosine transport was resistant to the typical inhibitors of mammalian ENTs, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, dilazep, and dipyridamole.
   - Growth analysis of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells expressing OsENTs showed that **OsENT2** transported adenosine and uridine with high affinity (adenosine, K(m) = 3.
   - In competition experiments with various cytokinins, adenosine transport by **OsENT2** was inhibited by isopentenyladenine riboside (iPR).
   - Direct measurements with radiolabeled cytokinins demonstrated that **OsENT2** mediated uptake of iPR (K(m) = 32 microm) and trans-zeatin riboside (K(m) = 660 microm), suggesting that **OsENT2** participates in iPR transport in planta.
   - Functional characterization and expression analysis of a gene, **OsENT2**, encoding an equilibrative nucleoside transporter in rice suggest a function in cytokinin transport.
   - In mature plants, **OsENT2** was predominantly expressed in roots.
