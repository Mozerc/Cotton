## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Os-AKT1 Channel Is Critical for K+ Uptake in Rice Roots and Is Modulated by the Rice CBL1-CIPK23 Complex.
   - Here, we report that **OsCBL1** also modulates nitrate signaling to regulate rice seedlings growth.
   - The calcium sensor **OsCBL1** modulates nitrate signaling to regulate seedling growth in rice..
   - Overall, our results showed a novel role for **OsCBL1** in the regulation of nitrate signaling and nitrate-mediated rice growth.
   - Here, we found that a protein **OsCBL1** (Calcineurin B-like protein 1) is involved in the regulation of nitrogen and phosphorus signaling in rice.
   - Compared with the wild type, knockdown of **OsCBL1** inhibit the growth of rice to the same extent, when nitrogen is deficient or nitrogen is present in the form of ammonium-nitrate mixture.
   - These results suggest that **OsCBL1** may be involved in the response of rice to nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition in the environment, as well as the regulation of rice growth by environmental nutrition.
   - **OsCBL1** affects rice seedling growth by modulating nitrate and phosphate responses.
