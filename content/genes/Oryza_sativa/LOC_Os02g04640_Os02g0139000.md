## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, unlike OsPHR2-overexpressing lines, which exhibited growth retardation under normal or Pi-deficient conditions, **OsPHR3**-overexpressing plants exhibited significant tolerance to low Pi stress but normal growth rates under normal Pi conditions, suggesting that **OsPHR3** would be useful for molecular breeding to improve Pi uptake/use efficiency under phosphate-deficient conditions.
   - We propose that OsPHR1, OsPHR2 and **OsPHR3** form a network and play diverse roles in regulating Pi signaling and homeostasis in rice.
   - **OsPHR3** affects the traits governing nitrogen homeostasis in rice..
   - During vegetative growth phase, compared with the wild-type, **OsPHR3** mutants showed significant variations in the adventitious root development, influx rates of 15N-NO3- and 15N-NH4+, concentrations of total N, NO3- and NH4+ in different tissues, and the relative expression levels of OsNRT1.
   - The effects of the mutation in **OsPHR3** was also explicit on the seed-set and grain yield during growth in a pot soil.
   - Here the role of **OsPHR3** was examined in regulating the homeostasis of N under different Pi regimes.
   - **OsPHR3** plays a pivotal role in regulating the homeostasis of N independent of Pi availability.
   - Overexpression of **OsPHR3** improves growth traits and facilitates nitrogen use efficiency under low phosphate condition.
   - Furthermore, overexpression of **OsPHR3** increased N use efficiency, 1000-grain weight and grain yield under different Pi conditions.
   - The overexpression of **OsPHR3** increased N uptake under Pi stress regimes.
   - ), **OsPHR3** is one of the four paralogs of PHR1, which acts as a central regulator of phosphate (Pi) homeostasis, as well being involved in N homeostasis.
   - However, the functions of **OsPHR3** in N utilization under different Pi conditions have yet to be fully studied.
