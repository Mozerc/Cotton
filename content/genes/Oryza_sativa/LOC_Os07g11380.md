## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of the 16-kDa α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor **RAG2** improves grain yield and quality in rice.
   - Overexpression of **RAG2** significantly increased grain size and improved grain quality and yield simultaneously.
   - These results imply that **RAG2** might play an important role in regulating grain weight and seed quality in rice.
   - The functional characterization of rice **RAG2** facilitates a further understanding of the mechanisms involved in grain size and seed quality, and may be helpful for improving grain yield and quantity in cereal crops.
   - **RAG2** is a member of 14-16 kDa α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors in rice, which belong to the albumin of seed storage proteins.
   - We found that **RAG2** was specifically expressed in ripening seed and its transcription peak was between 14 and 21 days after flowering.
