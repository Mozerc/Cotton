## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsMADS6** was initially named as MFO1 for mosaic floral organs based on its moderate mutant phenotypes.
   - Here, we report a null allele of **OsMADS6** (**OsMADS6**-5), which exhibited a strong mutant phenotype in spikelet without affecting vegetative traits, causing all floral organs except lemma homeotically transformed into lemma-like organs (LLOs) as well as an indeterminate floral meristem, thus resulting in a mutant floret consisting of reiterating whorls of lemma and LLOs.
   - Here, we describe an AGL6-like gene in rice (Oryza sativa), MOSAIC FLORAL ORGANS1 (**MFO1**/MADS6), that regulates floral organ identity and floral meristem determinacy.
   - Furthermore, the determinacy of the floral meristem was lost, and extra carpels or spikelets developed in **MFO1** florets.
   - So far, four moderate or weak mutant alleles of **OsMADS6** have been described, providing valuable insights into its role in flower development.
   - Taken together, our results revealed that **OsMADS6** acts as a critical regulator for early flower development in rice and provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of **OsMADS6**.
   - Characterization of **OsMADS6**-5, a null allele, reveals that **OsMADS6** is a critical regulator for early flower development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
   - OsMADS17 has been shown to play a minor role in floral development and appears to result from a duplication of **OsMADS6**.
   - Here, we show the biological role of the AGL6-like gene, **OsMADS6**, in specifying floral organ and meristem identities in rice (Oryza sativa L.
   - **OsMADS6** was strongly expressed in the floral meristem at early stages.
   - Compared to wild type plants, **OsMADS6** mutants displayed altered palea identity, extra glume-like or mosaic organs, abnormal carpel development and loss of floral meristem determinacy.
   - Strikingly, mutation of a SEPALLATA (SEP)-like gene, OsMADS1 (LHS1), enhanced the defect of **OsMADS6** flowers, and no inner floral organs or glume-like structures were observed in whorls 2 and 3 of osmads1-z **OsMADS6**-1 flowers.
   - Furthermore, the osmads1-z **OsMADS6**-1 double mutants developed severely indeterminate floral meristems.
   - Our finding, therefore, suggests that the ancient **OsMADS6** gene is able to specify floral state by determining floral organ and meristem identities in monocot crop rice together with OsMADS1.
   - The AGL6-like gene **OsMADS6** regulates floral organ and meristem identities in rice.
   - Subsequently, **OsMADS6** transcripts were mainly detectable in paleas, lodicules, carpels and the integument of ovule, as well as in the receptacle.
   - Further investigation shows that ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase genes, encoding the rate-limiting step enzyme in the starch synthesis pathway, are subject to the regulation of **OsMADS6**.
   - Auxin-responsive OsMGH3, a common downstream target of OsMADS1 and **OsMADS6**, controls rice floret fertility.
   - In the flower of **MFO1** mutants, the identities of palea and lodicule are disturbed, and mosaic organs were observed.
   - Whereas single mutants in either **MFO1** or the SEPALLATA-like gene LHS1 showed moderate phenotypes, the **MFO1** lhs1 double mutant showed a severe phenotype, including the loss of spikelet meristem determinacy.
   - OsMGH3/OsGH3-8 is expressed abundantly in rice florets and is regulated by two related and redundant transcription factors, OsMADS1 and **OsMADS6**, but its contribution to flower development is not known.
   - In consistently, over-expression of **OsMADS6** led to additional lodicule-, stamen- and carpel-like organs.
   - Expression analysis showed that **OsMADS6** controls the formation of the incipient primordia of lodicule, stamen and carpel via regulating the expression of class B, C and SEP-like MADS-box genes.
   - Here, we report that **OsMADS6** is highly expressed in flower and endosperm in Oryza sativa (rice).
   - **OsMADS6** plays an essential role in endosperm nutrient accumulation and is subject to epigenetic regulation in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - However, in contrast to other **OsMADS6** alleles, the afg1 mutant showed altered grain size and grain quality, with decreased total starch and amylose contents, and increased protein and soluble sugar contents.
   - The analysis of transcriptional activity suggested that **AFG1** is a transcriptional activator and may affect grain size by regulating the expression levels of several genes related to cell expansion and proliferation in the **AFG1** mutant.
   - These results revealed that **AFG1** plays an important role in determining palea identity and affecting grain yield and quality in rice.
   - Similar to previously characterized **OsMADS6** alleles, in the afg1 floret, the palea lost its marginal region and acquired the lemma identity.
   - We show here that the rice homeotic transcription factor OsMADS32 regulates floral patterning by interacting synergistically with E class protein **OsMADS6** in a dosage-dependent manner.
