- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We overexpressed both rice and Arabidopsis **CFL1** in Arabidopsis thaliana; these transgenic plants showed severely impaired cuticle development, similar to that in **CFL1** rice.
   - Reduced expression of At **CFL1** resulted in reinforcement of cuticle structure.
   - Suppression of HDG1 function resulted in similar defective cuticle phenotypes in wild-type Arabidopsis but much alleviated phenotypes in At **CFL1**-1 mutants.
   - The expression of two cuticle development-associated genes, BDG and FDH, was downregulated in At **CFL1** overexpressor and HDG1 suppression plants.
   - Our results suggest that rice and Arabidopsis **CFL1** negatively regulate cuticle development by affecting the function of HDG1, which regulates the downstream genes BDG and FDH.
   - **CFL1**, a WW domain protein, regulates cuticle development by modulating the function of HDG1, a class IV homeodomain transcription factor, in rice and Arabidopsis.
   - Biochemical evidence showed that At **CFL1** interacts with HDG1, a class IV homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor.
   - We identified a rice (Oryza sativa) dominant curly leaf mutant, curly flag leaf1 (**CFL1**), and cloned **CFL1**, which encodes a WW domain protein.
