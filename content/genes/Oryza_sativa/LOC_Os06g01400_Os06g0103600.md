## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os06g01400](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os06g01400)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os06g0103600](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os06g0103600)  
- **Gene Symbol:** RA1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - By transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, we found that **RA1** protein was localized in the chloroplast.
   - RNA analysis revealed biogenesis of chloroplast rRNAs was abnormal in **RA1**.
   - These results suggest that **RA1** is involved in early chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.
   - Expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthesis and plastid development related genes were disordered in the **RA1** mutant.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that **RA1** gene encodes a glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), which was confirmed by genetic complementation and knockout by Crispr/Cas9 technology.
