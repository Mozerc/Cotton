## Functional Descriptions:
   - The OsIAGLU gene driven by the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter was transformed into a rice cultivar to generate transgenic rice plants constitutively over-expressing this gene.
   - To decrease IAA levels, we selected the rice IAA-glucose synthase gene (OsIAGLU) from the rice genome database based on high sequence homology with IAA-glucose synthase from maize (ZmIAGLU), which is known to generate IAAglucose conjugate from free IAA.
   - Tiller formation in rice is altered by overexpression of OsIAGLU gene encoding an IAA-conjugating enzyme or exogenous treatment of free IAA.
   - The number of tillers and leaf angle was significantly increased with a concomitant decrease in plant height and panicle length in the transgenic rice lines overexpressing **OsIAAGLU** compared to the wild-type (WT) plants.
   - Furthermore, overexpression of **OsIAAGLU** resulted in reduced sensitivity to IAA/NAA and altered gravitropic response of the roots in the transgenic plants.
   - Overexpression of **OsIAAGLU** in rice resulted in altered rice shoot architecture and root gravitropism.
   - These results support that **OsIAAGLU** could play a regulatory role in IAA homeostasis and rice architecture.
   - **OsIAAGLU** could catalyze the reaction of IAA with glucose to generate IAA-glucose.
   - Expression of **OsIAAGLU** could be induced by IAA and NAA.
   - Overexpression of **OsIAAGLU** reveals a role for IAA-glucose conjugation in modulating rice plant architecture.
   - Consistently, ectopic expression of **OsIAGT1** leads to declined endogenous IAA content, as well as upregulated auxin synthesis genes and reduced expression of auxin-responsive genes, which likely leads to the reduced plant stature and root length in **OsIAGT1** overexpression lines.
   - Our result indicated that **OsIAGT1** plays an important role in mediating auxin homeostasis by catalyzing auxin glucosylation, and by which **OsIAGT1** regulates growth and development in rice.
   - In vitro enzymatic analysis showed that recombinant **OsIAGT1** was capable of catalyzing glucosylation of IAA, IBA and other auxin analogs, and that **OsIAGT1** is quite tolerant to a broad range of reaction conditions with peak activity at 30 <a1>ã§³ and pH<U+2009>8.
   - Further study indicated that expression of **OsIAGT1** can be upregulated by auxin in rice, and with **OsIAGT1** overexpressing lines we confirmed that **OsIAGT1** is indeed able to glucosylate IAA in vivo.
   - Indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase OsIAGLU regulates seed vigor through mediating crosstalk between auxin and abscisic acid in rice.
   - In this study, indole-3-acetate beta-glucosyltransferase OsIAGLU was cloned in rice, and its roles on seed vigor were mainly investigated.
   - Disruption of OsIAGLU resulted in low seed vigor in rice.
   - Transcriptome analysis revealed that the IAA- and ABA-related genes were involved in the OsIAGLU regulation of seed vigor in rice.
   - When treated with exogenous IAA and ABA, the osiaglu mutants and WT plants showed sensitivity to ABA while not IAA, but the exogenous IAA amplified ABA-induced reduction of seed vigor in rice.
   - The regulation of seed vigor by OsIAGLU might be through modulating IAA and ABA levels to alert OsABIs expression in germinating seeds in rice.
   - Based on analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphism data of rice accessions, two haplotypes of OsIAGLU that positively correlated with seed vigor were identified in indica accessions.
   - This study provides important insights into the roles of OsIAGLU on seed vigor and facilitates the practical use of OsIAGLU in rice breeding.
   - The higher levels of free IAA and ABA were identified in germinating seeds of osiaglu mutants compared to wide-type (WT) plants.
   - The continuously higher expressions of ABA INSENSITIVE 3 (OsABI3) and OsABI5 occurred in germinating seeds of osiaglu mutants compared to WT plants.
   - Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expressions of OsIAGLU were relatively higher in the late developing and the early germinating seeds and were significantly induced by indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA).
