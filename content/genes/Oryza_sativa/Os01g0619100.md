- **Gene Symbol:** OsTCL1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ectopic expression of R3 MYB transcription factor gene **OsTCL1** in Arabidopsis, but not rice, affects trichome and root hair formation.
   - Consistent with these observations, expression levels of GL2, R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene GLABRA1 (GL1) and several R3 MYB genes were greatly reduced, indicating that **OsTCL1** is functional R3 MYB.
   - Expressing **OsTCL1** in Arabidopsis inhibited trichome formation and promoted root hair formation, and **OsTCL1** interacted with GL3 when tested in Arabidopsis protoplasts.
   - However, trichome and root hair formation in transgenic rice plants overexpressing **OsTCL1** remained largely unchanged, and elevated expression of OsGL2 was observed in the transgenic rice plants, indicating that rice may use different mechanisms to regulate trichome formation.
