## Functional Descriptions:
   - **EAT1** exhibits delayed tapetal cell death and aborted pollen formation.
   - **EAT1** promotes tapetal cell death by regulating aspartic proteases during male reproductive development in rice.
   - A novel rice bHLH transcription factor, **DTD**, acts coordinately with TDR in controlling tapetum function and pollen development.
   - **EAT1** transcription factor, a non-cell-autonomous regulator of pollen production, activates meiotic small RNA biogenesis in rice anther tapetum.
   - This study indicates that **EAT1** is one of key regulators triggering meiotic phasiRNA biogenesis in anther tapetum, and that other bHLH proteins, TIP2 and UDT1, also play some important roles in this process.
   - In this study, **EAT1**-dependent non-cell-autonomous regulation of male meiosis was evidenced from microscopic observation of the **EAT1** mutant, in which meiosis with aberrantly decondensed chromosomes was retarded but accomplished somehow, eventually resulting in abortive microspores due to an aberrant tapetal PCD.
   - **EAT1** protein accumulated in tapetal-cell nuclei at early meiosis and postmeiotic microspore stages.
   - The transient assay also demonstrated that UNDEVELOPED TAPETUM1 (UDT1)/bHLH164 is a potential interacting partner of both **EAT1** and TIP2 during early meiosis.
   - Meiotic **EAT1** promoted transcription of 24-PHAS RNAs at 101 loci, and importantly, also activated DICER-LIKE5 (DCL5, previous DCL3b in rice) mRNA transcription that is required for processing of double-stranded 24-PHASs into 24-nt lengths.
   - UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and **EAT1** are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development.
