- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os01g0578000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os01g0578000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** RAD51C
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - These results suggest that **RAD51C** is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells.
   - The rice **RAD51C** gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells.
   - Transferring **RAD51C** to the **RAD51C**-KO line restored fertility.
   - The **RAD51C**-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the **RAD51C**-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development.
   - Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of **RAD51C**-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs).
   - Knockout (KO) of **RAD51C** resulted in both female and male sterility in rice.
