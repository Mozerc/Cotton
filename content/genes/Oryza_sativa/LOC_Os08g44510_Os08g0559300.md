## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two genes identified from the cDNA-RAPD were **OsSPY** and 14-3-3, possibly associated with stem height variations of the semidwarf and spindly mutants, respectively.
   - These results indicate that changes of **OsSPY** and 14-3-3 expression could affect internode elongation and cause the phenotypic changes of semidwarf and spindly rice mutants, respectively.
   - In addition to the GA-related phenotypes, **OsSPY** antisense and RNAi plants showed increased lamina joint bending, which is a brassinosteroid-related phenotype, indicating that **OsSPY** may play roles both in GA signaling and in the brassinosteroid pathway.
   - Expression analysis of **OsSPY**, 14-3-3, RSG, KO, and SLR1 was confirmed in rice internode tissues during the reproductive stage of the plants by semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique.
   - The **OsSPY** gene encoded the SPY protein which is considered to be a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA).
   - To understand the function of SPY in GA signaling in rice, we isolated a rice SPINDLY homolog (**OsSPY**) and produced knockdown transgenic plants in which **OsSPY** expression was reduced by introducing its antisense or RNAi construct.
   - In knockdown plants, the enhanced elongation of lower internodes was correlated with decreased levels of **OsSPY** expression, similar to the spindly phenotype of Arabidopsis spy mutants, suggesting that **OsSPY** also functions as a negative factor in GA signaling in rice.
   - The suppressive function of **OsSPY** in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of **OsSPY** function.
   - This indicates that the function of **OsSPY** in GA signaling is not via changes in the amount or stability of SLR1, but probably involves control of the suppressive function of SLR1.
   - Expression of **OsSPY** and 14-3-3 genes involved in plant height variations of ion-beam-induced KDML 105 rice mutants.
   - Further population genetics analysis demonstrated that the functional allele of **OsSPY** associated with semidwarfism and small panicles was selected in the process of rice breeding.
