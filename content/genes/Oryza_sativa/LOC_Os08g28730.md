## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Rice **BZ1** Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and  Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.
   - Molecular and biochemical analysis revealed that **BZ1** encodes a functional UDP-galactose/glucose epimerase (UGE) and is ubiquitously expressed with higher expression in stem and leaf tissues.
   - Lipid profiling assay showed that the amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDG), a major chloroplast membrane glycolipid, was significantly decreased in **BZ1**.
   - Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate that **BZ1** participates in UDP-galactose supply for the sugar chains biosynthesis of AGPs and MGDG, which thereby, respectively, results in altered cell wall and abnormal chloroplast development.
   - Due to inferior mechanical strength and reduced photosynthesis, **BZ1** plants displayed detrimental agronomic traits, whereas **BZ1** overexpressing lines showed enhanced plant growth.
   - Transcriptome analysis of stems and leaves further showed that numerous key genes involved in AGPs biosynthesis and photosynthesis metabolism were substantially suppressed in **BZ1**.
   - CONCLUSIONS: Our finding identifies **BZ1** as a dual-targeting UGE protein for glycosylation of AGPs and MGDG and suggests a strategy for breeding robust elite  crops.
   - Multiple techniques analyses, including immunoblots, immuno-gold, and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy, demonstrated a significantly impaired glycosylation of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) and disordered cellulose microfibril deposition in **BZ1**.
   - The Rice **BZ1** Locus Is Required for Glycosylation of Arabinogalactan Proteins and Galactolipid and Plays a Role in both Mechanical Strength and Leaf Color.
