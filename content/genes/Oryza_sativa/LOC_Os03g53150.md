## Functional Descriptions:
   - Earlier, we reported the isolation of **OsiIAA1** cDNA, first monocot member of Aux/IAA gene family from rice.
   - Extending this work further, we have isolated the **OsiIAA1** gene from rice localized on chromosome 3.
   - The increased accumulation of **OsiIAA1** transcript in auxin-treated rice coleoptiles even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, suggested that **OsiIAA1** is a primary auxin response gene; the expression of **OsiIAA1** gene was also upregulated in the presence of cycloheximide alone.
   - The **OsiIAA1** transcript levels were down-regulated in etiolated rice coleoptiles irradiated with far-red, red and blue light, suggesting the existence of a cross-talk between auxin and light signaling.
   - The antibodies raised against His6-**OsiIAA1** recombinant protein could detect the **OsiIAA1** protein in the plant extract only in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, indicating that **OsiIAA1** is rapidly degraded by proteasome complex.
   - Also, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized the purified His6-**OsiIAA1** protein to some extent in the cell-free extracts of rice coleoptiles.
   - The **OsiIAA1** protein harbors two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), one bipartite and the other resembling SV40 type NLS.
   - These studies indicate that nuclear localization of **OsiIAA1** could be a prerequisite for its role in auxin signal transduction.
   - Exogenous auxin enhances the degradation of a light down-regulated and nuclear-localized **OsiIAA1**, an Aux/IAA protein from rice, via proteasome.
   - In this study, we newly isolated and characterized a rice gain-of-function mutant, **OsIAA13**, containing a single amino acid substitution in the core sequence required for the degradation of the **OsIAA13** protein.
   - The **OsIAA13** mutant displayed typical auxin-related phenotypes: the number of lateral roots was significantly reduced and the root gravitropic response was defective.
   - **OsIAA13** mutants also exhibited altered GUS staining controlled by the DR5 promoter in lateral root initiation sites.
   - Furthermore, expression levels of several genes that might be associated with lateral root initiation were altered in **OsIAA13**.
   - Taken together, our results indicate that **OsIAA13** is involved in auxin signaling and controls the expression of genes that are required for lateral root initiation in rice.
   - **OsIAA13**-mediated auxin signaling is involved in lateral root initiation in rice.
