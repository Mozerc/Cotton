## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of OsBIERF1, **OsBIERF3** and OsBIERF4 was induced by treatments with BTH and salicylic acid, chemical inducers capable of inducing disease resistance response in rice.
   - In the BTH-treated rice seedlings, expression of OsBIERF1, **OsBIERF3** and OsBIERF4 was further induced by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, the rice blast fungus, as compared with those in water-treated seedlings.
   - The rice **OsBIERF3** encodes a protein belonging to the ethylene-responsive element binding protein (EREBP) transcription factor family and was shown to be induced by treatments with chemical inducers of disease resistance response, infection with the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea, and by treatments with some abiotic stress conditions, e.
   - In contrast, grain yield in OsCc1:**AP59** plants in the field was reduced by 23% to 43% compared with controls under both normal and drought stress conditions.
   - To better understand the function of **OsBIERF3** in disease resistance response and abiotic tolerance, we overexpressed the **OsBIERF3** gene in tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation with a construct containing the **OsBIERF3** ORF under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter.
   - Moreover, OsBIERF1, **OsBIERF3** and OsBIERF4 were also up-regulated by salt, cold, drought and wounding.
   - The overexpression of AP37 and **AP59** in rice under the control of the constitutive promoter OsCc1 increased the tolerance to drought and high salinity at the vegetative stage.
   - Our results suggest that **OsBIERF3** may play important roles in disease resistance response and salt tolerance.
   - Overexpression of the rice EREBP-like gene **OsBIERF3** enhances disease resistance and salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco.
   - Moreover, the **OsBIERF3**-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants also showed increased tolerance to salt stress.
   - ERF Transcription Factor **OsBIERF3** Positively Contributes to Immunity against Fungal and Bacterial Diseases but Negatively Regulates Cold Tolerance in Rice.
   - We previously showed that overexpression of the rice ERF transcription factor gene **OsBIERF3** in tobacco increased resistance against different pathogens.
   - Here, we report the function of **OsBIERF3** in rice immunity and abiotic stress tolerance.
   - These data demonstrate that **OsBIERF3** positively contributes to immunity against M.
