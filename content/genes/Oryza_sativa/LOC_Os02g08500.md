## Functional Descriptions:
   - Although meiosis initiates normally, as indicated by staining of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the meiotic chromosomes in **LEPTO1** mutant pollen mother cells (PMCs) fail to form the thin thread-like structures that are typical of leptotene chromosomes in wild-type PMCs.
   - **LEPTO1** is also essential for programmed cell death in tapetal cells.
   - Furthermore, **LEPTO1** mutants fail to form chromosomal double-strand breaks, do not recruit meiosis-specific proteins to the meiotic chromosomes, and show disrupted callose deposition.
   - **DLC1** is strongly expressed in the pollen mother cells (PMCs) and tapetum and encodes a nucleus-located rice type-B response regulator (RR) with transcriptional activity.
   - Further investigations show that **DLC1** interacts with all five putative rice histidine phosphotransfer proteins (HPs) in yeast and planta cells, suggesting a possible participation of the two-component signalling systems (TCS) in rice meiosis.
   - Our results demonstrate that **DLC1** is required for rice meiosis and fertility, providing useful information for the role of TCS in rice meiosis.
   - The **DLC1** mutant is sterile in both male and female gametophytes due to an earlier defect in the leptotene chromosome and subsequent abnormalities at later stages.
