## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os09g23200](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os09g23200)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os09g0395300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os09g0395300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** RL9,SLL1,AH2,OsADD1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **RL9** is mainly expressed in roots, leaves, and flowers.
   - The **SLL1** gene was expressed at the lateral root tip, whereas **SLL1** expression was not detected in the elongation zone of the crown roots.
   - These results indicate that the lateral root specific defect in **SLL1** mutant is caused by the different expression patterns of **SLL1** in lateral and crown roots.
   - In this study, we characterized two rice (Oryza sativa) allelic rolled-leaf mutants, rolled leaf 9-1 (**RL9**-1) and **RL9**-2, which display very similar phenotypes with completely adaxialized leaves and malformed spikelets.
   - Here, we show the isolation and functional characterization of SHALLOT-LIKE1 (**SLL1**), a key gene controlling rice leaf rolling.
   - **SLL1** is transcribed in various tissues and accumulates in the abaxial epidermis throughout leaf development.
   - Our findings identify the role of **SLL1** in the modulation of leaf abaxial cell development and in sustaining abaxial characteristics during leaf development.
   - An **SLL1** mutant has decreased lateral root growth due to a defect in the cell elongation.
   - **SLL1** encodes a SHAQKYF class MYB family transcription factor belonging to the KANADI family.
   - We have identified a gene, SHORT LATERAL ROOT LENGTH1 (**SLL1**), which is important for the elongation of lateral roots in rice.
   - In addition, **SLL1** over-expressers produced significantly longer lateral roots compared to the wild-type, and thus **SLL1** gene would be very useful for improving rice root architecture.
   - **SLL1**, which encodes a member of the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein fatty acid desaturase family, is involved in cell elongation in lateral roots via regulation of fatty acid content in rice.
   - **SLL1** deficiency leads to defective programmed cell death of abaxial mesophyll cells and suppresses the development of abaxial features.
   - We measured the fatty acid content and found that the 18:0 content in the **SLL1** mutant root was approximately 4 times that in the wild-type root.
   - The transient expression of a **RL9**-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein has indicated that **RL9** protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that **RL9** acts as a putative transcription factor.
   - Additionally, **SLL1** deficiency results in increased chlorophyll and photosynthesis.
   - **AH2** encodes a MYB domain protein that determines hull fate and affects grain yield and quality in rice..
   - In the study, **AH2** encodes a MYB domain protein, and functions in the development of hull and grain.
   - Mutation of **AH2** produces smaller grains and alters grain quality including decreased amylose content and gel consistency, and increased protein content.
   - Our results revealed that **AH2** plays an important role in the determination of hull epidermis development, palea identity, and grain size.
   - Meantime, part of the hull lost the outer silicified cells, and induces a transformation of the outer rough epidermis to inner smooth epidermis cells, and the body of the palea was reduced in the **AH2** muant.
