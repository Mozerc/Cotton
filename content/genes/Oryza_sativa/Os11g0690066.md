## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** None  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os11g0690066](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os11g0690066)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsWAK1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsWAK1** was also induced after treatment by mechanical wounding, SA and MeJA, but not by ABA.
   - However, **OsWAK1** expression was undetectable in leaves, stems and flowers but very weak in roots under normal growth conditions.
   - Northern blotting analysis showed that infection of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae significantly induced the **OsWAK1** transcripts, and the accumulation of **OsWAK1** mRNA occurred earlier and was more abundant in rice leaves infected with an incompatible race than with a compatible race of the blast fungus.
   - This provides functional evidence that induction of **OsWAK1** as a novel RLK plays important roles in plant disease resistance.
   - A novel wall-associated receptor-like protein kinase gene, **OsWAK1**, plays important roles in rice blast disease resistance.
   - **OsWAK1** not only has the ability of autophosphorylation but also can phosphorylate OsRFP1, a putative transcription regulator recently identified in rice.
   - Plasmolysis experiments further revealed **OsWAK1** is associated with the cell wall.
   - These results imply that **OsWAK1** is a novel gene involved in plant defense.
   - Furthermore, six transgenic rice lines with constitutive expression of **OsWAK1** became resistant to the compatible race.
