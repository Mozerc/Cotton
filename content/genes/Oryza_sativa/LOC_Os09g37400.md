- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice lines overexpressing **OsSAUR45** displayed pleiotropic developmental defects including reduced plant height and primary root length, fewer adventitious roots, narrower leaves, and reduced seed setting.
   - This research is the first to demonstrate that **OsSAUR45** is involved in plant growth though affecting auxin synthesis and transport by repressing OsYUCCA and OsPIN gene expression in rice.
   - These results demonstrate that **OsSAUR45** is involved in plant growth by affecting auxin synthesis and transport through the repression of OsYUCCA and OsPIN gene expression in rice.
   - The small auxin-up RNA **OsSAUR45** affects auxin synthesis and transport in rice.
   - Auxin levels and transport were reduced in the **OsSAUR45** overexpression lines, potentially because of decreased expression of Flavin-binding monooxygenase family proteins (OsYUCCAs) and PIN-FORMED family proteins (OsPINs).
   - Exogenous auxin application rapidly induced **OsSAUR45** expression and partially restored the phenotype of rice lines overexpressing **OsSAUR45**.
   - **OsSAUR45** is expressed in a tissue-specific pattern and is localized to the cytoplasm.
