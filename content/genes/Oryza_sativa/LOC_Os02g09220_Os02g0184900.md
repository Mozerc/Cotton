## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsCYP71D8L** as a key regulator involved in growth and stress response by mediating gibberellins homeostasis in rice..
   - Thus, our results suggest that **OsCYP71D8L** plays important roles in regulating rice growth and stress responses by coordinating GAs and CKs homeostasis, and it is useful to engineer stress-tolerant rice.
   - We found that its gain-of-function mutant (cyp71d8l) and transgenic plants overexpressing **OsCYP71D8L** (**OsCYP71D8L**-OE) displayed similar phenotypes including dwarfed plant, reduced panicle length and grain number per panicle, and their endogenous GAs levels were notably decreased as compared to wild type (WT), respectively.
