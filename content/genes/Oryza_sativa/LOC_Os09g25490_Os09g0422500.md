## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [LOC_Os09g25490](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os09g25490)  &nbsp;,&nbsp; [Os09g0422500](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os09g0422500)  
- **Gene Symbol:** Bc6,OsCesA9
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In rice expressing a reporter construct, **Bc6** promoter activity was detected in the culms, nodes, and flowers, and was localized primarily in xylem tissues.
   - These results indicate that **OsCesA9** plays an important role in cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth.
   - Bc6 encodes a cellulose synthase catalytic subunit, **OsCesA9**, and has a missense mutation in its highly conserved region.
   - Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that **Bc6** mutation reduced the cell wall thickness of sclerenchymal cells in culms.
   - These results indicate that **Bc6** is a secondary cell wall-specific CesA that plays an important role in proper deposition of cellulose in the secondary cell walls.
   - In culms of the **Bc6** mutant, the proportion of cellulose was reduced by 38%, while that of hemicellulose was increased by 34%.
   - Introduction of the semi-dominant **Bc6** mutant gene into wild-type rice significantly reduced the percentage of cellulose, causing brittle phenotypes.
   - The **OsCesA9** gene is predominantly expressed in the culms of mature stage plants, consistent with the brittle phenotype in the culm.
   - Genetic analysis and map-based cloning showed that all the phenotype of S1-60 mutant was caused by a recessive point mutation in the **OsCesA9** gene, which encodes the cellulose synthase A subunit 9.
   - We show here that the genes responsible for three distinct brittle mutations of rice, induced by the insertion of the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, correspond to CesA (cellulose synthase catalytic subunit) genes, OsCesA4, OsCesA7 and **OsCesA9**.
   - **OsCesA9** conserved-site mutation leads to largely enhanced plant lodging resistance and biomass enzymatic saccharification by reducing cellulose DP and crystallinity in rice..
   - A Semi-Dominant Mutation in **OsCesA9** Improves Salt Tolerance and Favors Field Straw Decay Traits by Altering Cell Wall Properties in Rice.
