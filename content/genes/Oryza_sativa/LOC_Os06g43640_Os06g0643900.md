## Functional Descriptions:
   - Their stress-inducible expression provided the protection against yield loss in transgenic plants, indicating the agronomic relevance of **OsSAP1**1 and OsRLCK253 in conferring abiotic stress tolerance.
   - Functionally, both **OsSAP1**1 and OsRLCK253 could improve the water-deficit and salt stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants via a signaling pathway affecting the expression of several common endogenous genes.
   - While the abundance of **OsPAP26** transcript is not affected by Pi supply, it is upregulated during leaf senescence.
   - Furthermore, Pi deprivation and leaf senescence greatly increased the abundance of **OsPAP26** protein.
   - Overexpression or RNA interference (RNAi) of **OsPAP26** in transgenic rice significantly increased or reduced APase activities in leaves, roots and growth medium, respectively.
   - Western blot analysis of protein extracts from callus growth medium confirmed that **OsPAP26** is a secreted PAP.
   - **OsPAP26**-overexpressing plants were capable of converting more ATP into inorganic Pi in the growth medium, which further supported the potential role of **OsPAP26** in utilizing organic P in rhizosphere.
   - In summary, we concluded that **OsPAP26** perform dual functions in plants: Pi remobilization from senescing to non-senescing leaves and organic P utilization.
   - **OsPAP26** encodes a major purple acid phosphatase and regulates phosphate remobilization in rice..
