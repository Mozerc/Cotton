- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we show that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) **Ghd7**, isolated from an elite rice hybrid and encoding a CCT domain protein, has major effects on an array of traits in rice, including number of grains per panicle, plant height and heading date.
   - Enhanced expression of **Ghd7** under long-day conditions delays heading and increases plant height and panicle size.
   - Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (**Ghd7**) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions.
   - Ehd1 and Hd3a can also be down-regulated by the photoperiodic flowering genes **Ghd7** and Hd1 (a rice ortholog of CONSTANS).
   - By using near-isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering-time genes, we observed significant digenetic interactions between Hd16 and four other flowering-time genes (**Ghd7**, Hd1, DTH8 and Hd2).
   - These results demonstrate that Hd16 acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of the phosphorylation of **Ghd7**.
   - Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (**Ghd7**), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice's photoperiodic flowering pathway.
   - On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT-like genes and by downregulation of Ehd1 by the flowering repressor **Ghd7** - a unique pathway in rice.
   - Furthermore, Ehd3 **Ghd7** plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 **Ghd7** plants, suggesting a **Ghd7**-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1.
   - We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and Ehd1) and negative (Hd1, phyB and **Ghd7**) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice.
   - **Ghd7** (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning.
   - However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (**Ghd7**) pathway was altered in ostrx1.
   - Increased transcription of **Ghd7** under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of **Ghd7** in floral induction.
   - rufipogon) was used to analyze the evolution and association of **Ghd7** with plant height, heading date, and yield.
   - Meanwhile, the transcription of DTH8 has been proved to be independent of **Ghd7** and Hd1, and the natural mutation of this gene caused weak photoperiod sensitivity and shorter plant height.
   - Analyses using a rice phytochrome chromophore-deficient mutant, photoperiod sensitivity5, have so far revealed that within this network, phytochromes are required for expression of Grain number, plant height and heading date7 (**Ghd7**), a floral repressor gene in rice.
   - Similarly, in the homozygous Koshihikari genetic background at **Ghd7**, the difference in heading date caused by different alleles at Hd2 was smaller than in plants homozygous for the Hayamasari **Ghd7** allele.
   - In addition, QTLs near Hd2, Hd16, and **Ghd7**, which are involved in inhibition of heading under long-day conditions, function in the same pathway that controls heading date.
   - SNP changes between haplotypes indicated that **Ghd7** evolved from two distinct ancestral gene pools, and independent domestication processes were detected in indica and japonica varietals respectively.
   - Thus, two distinct gating mechanisms--of the floral promoter Ehd1 and the floral repressor **Ghd7**--could enable manipulation of slight differences in day length to control Hd3a transcription with a critical day-length threshold.
   - Transcript levels of OsGI, phytochrome genes, and Early heading date3 (Ehd3), which function upstream of **Ghd7**, were unchanged in the mutant.
   - Moreover, phyB and phyA can affect **Ghd7** activity and Early heading date1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively.
   - These associations provide the potential for flexibility of **Ghd7** application in rice breeding programs.
   - Notably, the japonica varieties harboring nonfunctional alleles of both **Ghd7**/Hd4 and PRR37/Hd2 flower extremely early under natural long-day conditions, and are adapted to the northernmost regions of rice cultivation, up to 53 degrees N latitude.
   - Genetic analysis revealed that the effects of PRR37 and **Ghd7** alleles on heading date are additive, and PRR37 down-regulates Hd3a expression to suppress flowering under long-day conditions.
   - Thus, **Ghd7** has played crucial roles for increasing productivity and adaptability of rice globally.
   - Natural variation in **Ghd7** is an important regulator of heading date and yield potential in rice.
   - The enhanced expression of **Ghd7** decreased chlorophyll content, mainly through down-regulating the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chloroplast.
   - We employed a map-based cloning approach to isolate a heading date gene, which coordinated the interaction between **Ghd7** and Ghd8 to greatly delay rice heading.
   - Map-based cloning demonstrated that the gene largely affecting the interaction between **Ghd7** and Ghd8 was Hd1.
   - Here, we report biological interactions between **Ghd7** and Hd1, which together repress Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), a key floral inducer under non-inductive long-day (LD) conditions.
   - These findings imply that Hd1, an evolutionally conserved transcriptional activator, can function as a strong transcriptional repressor within a monocot-specific flowering-time pathway through with **Ghd7**.
   - These findings suggest that Hd1 alone essentially acts as a promoter of heading date, and the protein interaction between **Ghd7** and Hd1 determines photoperiod sensitivity and integrated Hd1-mediated and Ehd1-mediated flowering pathways in rice.
   - Importance of the Interaction between Heading Date Genes Hd1 and **Ghd7** for Controlling Yield Traits in Rice..
   - In this study, influences of interaction between Hd1 and **Ghd7** on flowering time and yield traits were analyzed using near isogenic lines derived from a cross between indica rice cultivars ZS97 and MY46.
   - **Ghd7** is a major regulator of flowering time in rice, which strongly delays flowering under LD.
   - We also found that co-expressing OsGI with **Ghd7** causes reduced accumulation of **Ghd7** protein and partially suppresses the delayed flowering phenotype in the wild type background, suggesting that phytochromes and OsGI play antagonist roles in regulating **Ghd7** protein stability and flowering time.
   - This study was carried out to explore the transcription factor binding site (TFBS) architecture of the **Ghd7** promoter to identify the regulatory dynamics of **Ghd7** transcription.
   - In addition to the previously identified 8 cis-elements, 448 novel cis-elements were identified in the **Ghd7** promoter that provide binding sites for 25 transcription factor families.
   - The identified transcription factor families include key transcription factors involved in both development and abiotic stress responses, revealing the regulatory dynamics of **Ghd7**.
   - The architecture of the **Ghd7** promoter reveals the roles of **Ghd7** in growth, development and the abiotic stress response in rice..
   - **Ghd7** delays the plant's flowering under long-day conditions, which ultimately results in increased yield.
   - Recent findings indicate that **Ghd7** also plays a major role in the abiotic stress response; however, the fine regulatory mechanisms controlling **Ghd7** expression have yet to be uncovered.
   - This study supports the model that **Ghd7** acts as a central regulator of rice growth, development, and the abiotic stress response.
   - Os**Ghd7** is a functional allele of the **Ghd7** gene family; knockouts of Os**Ghd7** generated by CRISPR-Cas9 significantly accelerated flowering time and the earliness of the flowering time depended on field location.
   - Genetic effect of a new allele for the flowering time locus **Ghd7** in rice.
   - Segregation analysis using an F2 population derived from the cross between Hoshinoyume and Sorachi demonstrated that the **Ghd7** locus contributed to extremely early flowering time in Sorachi.
   - This **Ghd7** allele in Sorachi showed a weak function in terms of delay of flowering time, compared with loss-of-function allele, and a distinct distribution in northern Japan.
   - We also revealed that PhyB can control **Ghd7** repressor activity as a temperature sensor to inhibit Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 at lower temperatures, likely through a post-transcriptional regulation, despite inductive photoperiod conditions.
   - In addition to delayed flowering because of low growth rates, we found that photoperiodic flowering is clearly enhanced by both Hd1 and **Ghd7** genes under low-temperature conditions in rice.
   - The rising of ambient temperatures in early summer would contribute to inhibition of **Ghd7** repressor activity, resulting in the appropriate floral induction of rice in temperate climates.
   - A **Ghd7** involved transcriptional regulatory network has been established, but its translational regulatory pathway is poorly understood.
   - **Ghd7** is an important gene involving in photoperiod flowering pathway in rice.
   - These findings are helpful to deeply understand the **Ghd7** involved photoperiod flowering pathway and promote the elucidation of rice heading.
