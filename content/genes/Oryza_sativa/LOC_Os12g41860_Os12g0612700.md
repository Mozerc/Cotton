## Functional Descriptions:
   - p**OsHox33**::GUS fusion expression and RT-PCR revealed that **OsHox33** is highly expressed in young organs, especially in young meristems such as shoot apical meristems, intercalary meristems, and young callus.
   - In this study, we analyzed a HD-Zip III member, **OsHox33**, and demonstrated that it plays an important role in age-dependent leaf senescence in rice.
   - Transgenic plants harboring either RNAi construct displayed similar phenotypes of precocious leaf senescence symptoms, suggesting that knockdown of **OsHox33** accelerates leaf senescence in rice.
   - Finally, real-time PCR studies showed that **OsHox33** can regulate the expression of GS1 and GS2, two senescence-associated genes.
   - Knockdown of **OsHox33**, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice.
   - Plants ectopically expressing microRNA166-resistant versions of the **OSHB3** gene exhibited severe defects, including the ectopic production of leaf margins, shoots, and radialized leaves.
   - To further investigate **OsHox33** function, we analyzed chloroplast ultrastructure in different-aged leaves of RNAi plants, and found that **OsHox33** knockdown accelerated chloroplast degradation, which is consistent with RNAi phenotypes.
   - Furthermore, this ectopic expression of **OSHB3** was correlated with leaf initiation defects.
   - The treatment of seedlings with auxin quickly induced ectopic **OSHB3** expression in the entire region of the SAM, but not in other tissues.
