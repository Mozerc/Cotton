## Functional Descriptions:
   - To investigate gibberellin (GA) signaling using the rice (Oryza sativa) GA receptor GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (**GID1**) mutant **GID1**-8, we isolated a suppressor mutant, Suppressor of **GID1**-1 (Sgd-1).
   - GA perception by **GID1** causes SLR1 protein degradation involving the F-box protein GID2; this triggers GA-associated responses such as shoot elongation and seed germination.
   - Thermodynamic characterization of **OsGID1**-gibberellin binding using calorimetry and docking simulations.
   - An exception is the GA-insensitive F-box mutant gid2, which shows milder dwarfism than mutants such as **GID1** and cps even though it accumulates higher levels of SLR1.
   - The level of SLR1 protein in gid2 was decreased by loss of **GID1** function or treatment with a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, and dwarfism was enhanced.
   - Conversely, overproduction of **GID1** or treatment with GA(3) increased the SLR1 level in gid2 and reduced dwarfism.
   - Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes **GID1** (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), GID2 and SLR1.
   - Previously, a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay revealed that the **GID1**-GA complex directly interacts with SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor protein in GA signaling.
   - GA(4) was found to have the highest affinity to **GID1** in Y2H assays and is the most effective form of GA in planta.
   - To identify the important regions of **GID1** for GA and SLR1 interactions, we used many different mutant versions of **GID1**, such as the spontaneous mutant **GID1**s, N- and C-terminal truncated **GID1**s, and mutagenized **GID1** proteins with conserved amino acids replaced with Ala.
   - The amino acid residues important for SLR1 interaction completely overlapped the residues required for GA binding that were scattered throughout the **GID1** molecule.
   - GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (**GID1**) encodes a soluble gibberellin (GA) receptor that shares sequence similarity with a hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).
   - It is assumed that interaction between GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (**GID1**) and the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 triggers F-box protein GID2-mediated SLR1 degradation.
   - Under normal growth conditions, there was more PBZ1 protein in **GID1** than in the wild type.
   - A recessive gibberellin (GA)-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, gibberellin-insensitive dwarf1 (**GID1**), has been identified, which shows a severe dwarf phenotype and contains high concentrations of endogenous GA.
   - **GID1**, a gibberellin-insensitive dwarf mutant, shows altered regulation of probenazole-inducible protein (PBZ1) in response to cold stress and pathogen attack.
   - The entcopalyl diphosphate synthase (OsCPS) genes, which encode enzymes at the branch point between GA and phytoalexin biosynthesis, were expressed differentially in **GID1** relative to the wild type.
   - Specifically, OsCPS1, which encodes an enzyme in the GA biosynthesis pathway, was down-regulated and OsCPS2 and OsCPS4, which encode enzymes in phytoalexin biosynthesis, were up-regulated in **GID1**.
   - These results suggest that the expression of PBZ1 is regulated by GA signalling and stress stimuli, and that **GID1** is involved in tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus.
   - When the gibberellin (GA) receptor GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (**GID1**) binds to GA, **GID1** interacts with DELLA proteins, repressors of GA signaling.
   - Molecular interactions of a soluble gibberellin receptor, **GID1**, with a rice DELLA protein, SLR1, and gibberellin.
   - In addition, **GID1** showed increased tolerance to cold stress and resistance to blast fungus infection.
   - Together, our results indicate that **GID1** is a soluble receptor mediating GA signalling in rice.
   - A rice **GID1** suppressor mutant reveals that gibberellin is not always required for interaction between its receptor, **GID1**, and DELLA proteins.
   - This activity was suppressed by the GA-dependent **GID1**-SLR1 interaction, which may explain why GA responses are induced in the presence of GA.
   - Our results indicate that the N-terminal region of SLR1 has two roles in GA signaling: interaction with **GID1** and transactivation activity.
   - These results indicate that derepression of SLR1 repressive activity can be accomplished by GA and **GID1** alone and does not require F-box (GID2) function.
   - Evidence for GA signaling without GID2 was also provided by the expression behavior of GA-regulated genes such as GA-20oxidase1, **GID1**, and SLR1 in the gid2 mutant.
   - Here we report the isolation and characterization of a new GA-insensitive dwarf mutant of rice, **GID1**.
   - In rice, the initial GA-signaling events involve the binding of a GA to the soluble GA receptor protein, **GID1**.
   - Herein, we present a study aimed at defining the types of forces important to binding via a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and computational docking studies that employed rice GID1 (**OsGID1**), **OsGID1** mutants, which were designed to have a decreased possible number of hydrogen bonds with bound GA, and GA variants.
   - We find that, in general, GA binding is enthalpically driven and that a hydrogen bond between the phenolic hydroxyl of **OsGID1** Tyr134 and the C-3 hydroxyl of a GA is a defining structural element.
   - **GID1** modulates stomatal response and submergence tolerance involving ABA and GA signaling in rice.
   - Interestingly, the **GID1** mutant had increased levels of chlorophyll and carbohydrates under submergence condition, and showed enhanced ROS-scavenging ability and submergence tolerance compared with the wild-type.
   - Further analyses suggested that the function of **GID1** in submergence responses is partially dependent on ABA, and GA signaling by **GID1** is involved in submergence tolerance by modulating carbohydrate consumption.
   - Taken together, these findings suggest **GID1** plays distinct roles in stomatal response and submergence tolerance through both the ABA and GA signaling pathways in rice.
   - The **GID1** mutant showed impaired biosynthesis of endogenous ABA under drought stress condition, but it exhibited enhanced sensitivity to exogenous ABA.
   - Scanning electron microscope and infrared thermal image analysis indicated an increase in the stomatal conductance in the **GID1** mutant under drought condition.
   - Overexpression of **OsGID1** Enhances the Resistance of Rice to the Brown Planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.
   - The overexpression of **OsGID1** (oe-GID1) decreased BPH-induced levels of SA, H<U+2082>O<U+2082>, and three SA-pathway-related WRKY transcripts, but enhanced BPH-induced levels of ethylene.
   - Viral proteins encoded by different types of rice viruses all directly trigger the rapid degradation of SLR1 by promoting association with the GA receptor **OsGID1**.
