## Functional Descriptions:
   - WD40-domain protein **GORI** is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice..
   - **GORI** encodes a seven-WD40-motif protein that interacts with an AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH)-domain protein, which modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and regulates Rac6 activity in the apical plasma membrane of elongating pollen tubes.
   - Loss of function of **GORI** or Rac6 reduces pollen germination and tube growth, thereby resulting in male sterility in rice.
   - In contrast, overexpression of Rac6 increases pollen tube elongation, with this effect being rescued by **GORI** overexpression.
   - Our findings demonstrated that the **GORI** protein is a positive regulator of pollen germination and tube growth, serving as a link between Rac6 activity regulation and ANTH-mediated endocytosis.
   - Root ion concentrations indicated that **OsABT** overexpression lines could maintain lower Na(+) and higher K(+)/Na(+) ratios and upregulated expression of salt-related genes OsSOS1 and OsHAK5 compared with the wild-type (WT) Nipponbare plants.
   - A transcriptome analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between **OsABT** overexpression lines and WT plants were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, including ABA signaling pathway under salt stress.
   - **OsABT** Is Involved in Abscisic Acid Signaling Pathway and Salt Tolerance of Roots at the Rice Seedling Stage..
   - Thus, **OsABT** can improve the salt tolerance in rice seedling roots by inhibiting reactive oxygen species accumulation, thereby regulating the intracellular Na(+)/K(+) balance, ABA content, and ABA signaling pathway.
   - Furthermore, Overexpression of **OsABT** decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, while downregulating the ABA synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 and upregulating the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2.
   - The yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses showed that **OsABT** interacted with the ABA receptor proteins OsPYL4, OsPYL10, and PP2C phosphatase OsABIL2.
