## Functional Descriptions:
   - Molecular and biochemical studies reveal that two different cytochrome P450s, CYP90B2/OsDWARF4 and **CYP724B1**/D11, function redundantly in C-22 hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis.
   - The gene was found to encode a novel cytochrome P450 (**CYP724B1**), which showed homology to enzymes involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis.
   - Precise determination of the defective step(s) in BR synthesis in **D11** mutants proved intractable because of tissue specificity and the complex control of BR accumulation in plants.
   - However, 6-deoxotyphasterol (6-DeoxoTY) and typhasterol (TY), but not any upstream intermediates before these compounds, effectively restored BR response in **D11** mutants in a lamina joint bending assay.
   - Multiple lines of evidence together suggest that the D11/**CYP724B1** gene plays a role in BR synthesis and may be involved in the supply of 6-DeoxoTY and TY in the BR biosynthesis network in rice.
   - Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including **D11**, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways.
   - Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, **D11**, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback.
   - We have characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf11 (**D11**), that bears seeds of reduced length.
   - To understand the mechanism by which seed length is regulated, the **D11** gene was isolated by a map-based cloning method.
   - The dwarf phenotype of **D11** mutants was restored by the application of the brassinolide (BL).
   - Overexpression of **CPB1**/D11 under the background of **CPB1** mutant not only rescued normal panicle architecture and plant height, but also had a larger leaf angle and seed size than the controls.
   - Genetic transformation experiments confirmed that a His360Leu amino acid substitution residing in the highly conserved region of **CPB1**/D11 was responsible for the panicle architecture and seed size changes in the **CPB1** mutants.
   - Overexpression of **GNS4** significantly increased organ size, 1000-grain weight, and panicle size, and subsequently enhanced grain yields in both the Nipponbare and Wuyunjing7 (a high-yielding cultivar) backgrounds.
   - A single nucleotide polymorphism (deletion) in the promoter region of **GNS4** reduced its expression level in the mutant, leading to reduced grain number and smaller grains.
   - Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that **GNS4** positively regulates grain size by promoting cell elongation.
   - **GNS4** was identified as a positive regulator of grain number and grain size in rice.
   - We characterized a rice mutant **GNS4** (grain number and size on chromosome 4) with reduced organ size, fewer grains per panicle, and smaller grains compared with those of WT.
   - Map-based cloning indicated that the **GNS4** gene, encoding a cytochrome P450 protein, is a novel allele of DWARF11 (D11).
   - These results suggest that **GNS4** is key target gene with possible applications in rice yield breeding.
   - **GNS4** can be targeted in breeding programs to increase yields.
   - Overall, it can be concluded that **PMM1** is an important gene involved in BRs biosynthesis and affecting the differentiation of spikelet primordia and patterns of panicle branches in rice.
   - Overexpression of D4 could successfully rescue the abnormal panicle architecture of **PMM1** plants, indicating that **PMM1**/D11 and D4 function redundantly in BRs biosynthesis.
   - **PMM1** is a new allele of DWARF11 (D11) **PMM1** transcripts are preferentially expressed in young panicles, particularly expressed in the primordia of branches and spikelets during inflorescence development.
   - Map-based cloning revealed that a large fragment deletion from the 2nd to 9th exons of **PMM1** was responsible for the clustered primary branch morphology in **PMM1**-1.
   - Thus, our results demonstrated that **PMM1** determines the inflorescence architecture by controlling brassinosteroid biosynthesis in rice.
