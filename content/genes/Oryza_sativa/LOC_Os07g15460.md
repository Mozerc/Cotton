## Functional Descriptions:
   - Role of the iron transporter **OsNRAMP1** in cadmium uptake and accumulation in rice.
   - The growth of yeast expressing **OsNRAMP1** was impaired in the presence of Cd compared with yeast transformed with an empty vector.
   - The role of the iron transporter **OsNRAMP1** in Cd uptake and transport in rice was investigated here.
   - The **OsNRAMP1** iron transporter is involved in Cd accumulation in rice.
   - The expression of **OsNRAMP1** in the roots was higher in a high Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than a low Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki) regardless of the presence of Cd, and the amino acid sequence of **OsNRAMP1** showed 100% identity between Sasanishiki and Habataki.
   - These results suggest that **OsNRAMP1** participates in cellular Cd uptake and Cd transport within plants, and the higher expression of **OsNRAMP1** in the roots could lead to an increase in Cd accumulation in the shoots.
   - Rice has seven putative metal transporter NRAMP genes, but microarray analysis showed that only **OsNRAMP1** is highly up-regulated by iron (Fe) deficiency.
   - **OsNRAMP1** expression was observed mainly in roots and was higher in the roots of a high-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Habataki) than in those of a low-Cd-accumulating cultivar (Sasanishiki).
   - These results suggest that **OsNRAMP1** participates in cellular Cd uptake and that the differences observed in Cd accumulation among cultivars are because of differences in **OsNRAMP1** expression levels in roots.
   - Immunostaining showed that **OsNRAMP1** was localized in all root cells except the central vasculature, and in leaf mesophyll cells.
   - The knockout of **OsNRAMP1** resulted in significant decreases in root uptake of Cd and Mn and their accumulation in rice shoots and grains, and increased sensitivity to Mn deficiency.
   - **OsNRAMP1** contributes to cadmium and manganese uptake in rice.
   - Here, we showed that **OsNRAMP1** was able to transport Cd and manganese (Mn) when expressed in yeast, but did not transport Fe or As.
   - **OsNRAMP1** was mainly expressed in roots and leaves and encoded a plasma membrane-localized protein.
   - Previous studies reported that the rice **OsNRAMP1** (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein 1) could transport iron (Fe), Cd and arsenic (As) in heterologous yeast assays.
   - **OsNRAMP1** expression was induced by Cd treatment and Fe deficiency.
   - The rice heavy metal transporter **OsNRAMP1** regulates disease resistance by modulating ROS homeostasis.
   - The **OsNRAMP1** mutants had increased content of H(2) O(2) and activity of superoxide dismutase, but decreased activity of catalase, exhibiting enhanced broad-spectrum resistance against bacterial and fungal pathogens.
   - Altered expression of metal ion-dependent ROS-scavenging enzymes genes and lower accumulation of cations such as Mn coordinately triggered compromised metal ion-dependent enzyme-catalyzing activity and modulated ROS homeostasis, which together contributed to disease resistance in **OsNRAMP1** mutants.
   - Taken together, a proof-of-concept was achieved that broad-spectrum disease resistance and toxic heavy metal-safe rice was engineered by removal of **OsNRAMP1** gene.
   - Here, we show that rice heavy metal transporter **OsNRAMP1** plays important roles in plant immunity by modulating metal ions and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis.
