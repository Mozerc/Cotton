## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OsTMN11** knockdown (by RNAi) compromised the growth of young rice, manifested as shorter plant height, reduced biomass, and chlorosis under excessive Mn and Cd conditions.
   - The mature RNAi plants contained less Mn but accumulated Cd in grains and rice straw, confirming that **OsTMN11** plays a fundamental role in metal homeostasis associated with rice growth and development even under normal Mn supply conditions.
   - Two lifelong field trials with rice cropped in either normal Mn supply conditions or in Cd-contaminated farmland demonstrated that knockdown of **OsTMN11** impaired the capacity of seed development (including panicle, spikelet fertility, seed length, grain weight, etc.
   - **OsTMN11** was ubiquitously expressed over the lifespan of rice and strongly upregulated in young rice under excess Mn(II)/Cd(II) stress.
