## Functional Descriptions:
   - Rice is a short-day plant, and we found that mutation in either phyB or **PHYC** caused moderate early flowering under the long-day photoperiod, while monogenic phyA mutation had little effect on the flowering time.
   - The phyA mutation, however, in combination with phyB or **PHYC** mutation caused dramatic early flowering.
   - ACO1 expression was controlled mainly by phyA and phyB, and a histochemical analysis showed that ACO1 expression was localized to the basal parts of leaf sheaths of phyAphyB**PHYC** seedlings, similar to mature wild-type plants at the heading stage, when internode elongation was greatly promoted.
   - Seedlings of phyB and phyB **PHYC** mutants exhibited a partial loss of sensitivity to continuous red light (Rc) but still showed significant deetiolation responses.
   - In addition, the transcription levels of several ethylene- or gibberellin (GA)-related genes were changed in phyAphyB**PHYC** mutants, and measurement of the plant hormone levels indicated low ethylene production and bioactive GA levels in the phyAphyB**PHYC** mutants.
   - Distinct metabolic profiles between phyA phyB **PHYC** triple mutants and the wild type (WT), as well as those between young and mature leaf blades, could be clearly observed by principal component analysis (PCA).
   - The metabolite profiles indicated high accumulation of amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar phosphates, and nucleotides in the leaf blades of phyA phyB **PHYC** triple mutants, especially in the young leaves, compared with those in the WT.
   - Although phyAphyB**PHYC** phytochrome-null mutants in rice (Oryza sativa) have morphological changes and exhibit internode elongation, even as seedlings, it is unknown how phytochromes contribute to the control of internode elongation.
   - A gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1), which is an ethylene biosynthesis gene contributing to internode elongation, was up-regulated in phyAphyB**PHYC** seedlings.
   - We demonstrate that ethylene induced internode elongation and ACO1 expression in phyAphyB**PHYC** seedlings but not in the wild type and that the presence of bioactive GAs was necessary for these effects.
   - RESULTS: A rice mutant, late heading date 3 (**LHD3**), was characterized, and the gene **LHD3** was identified with a map-based cloning strategy.
   - Compared with wild-type plants, the **LHD3** mutant exhibited delayed flowering under both LD (long-day) and SD (short-day) conditions, and delayed flowering time was positively associated with the day length via the Ehd1 pathway.
   - In addition, **LHD3** showed a pale-green-leaf phenotype and a slower chlorophyll synthesis rate during the greening process.
   - The transcription patterns of many key genes involved in photoperiod-mediated flowering and chlorophyll synthesis were altered in **LHD3**.
