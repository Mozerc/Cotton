## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os03g06120](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g06120)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os03g0157300](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os03g0157300)  
- **Gene Symbol:** OsMCA1,PAD,OsDMT1
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/)&nbsp;,&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A promoter-reporter assay suggested that **OsMCA1** mRNA is widely expressed in seed embryos, proximal and apical regions of shoots, and mesophyll cells of leaves and roots in rice.
   - We also generated and characterized **OsMCA1**-RNAi transgenic plants and cultured cells; **OsMCA1**-suppressed plants showed retarded growth and shortened rachises, while **OsMCA1**-suppressed cells carrying Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin showed partially impaired changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) induced by hypo-osmotic shock and trinitrophenol, an activator of mechanosensitive channels.
   - A SNP in **OsMCA1** responding for a plant architecture defect by deactivation of bioactive GA in rice.
   - Our results revealed the pad is a loss-of-function mutant of the **OsMCA1**/PAD, leading to upregulation of genes related to GA deactivation, which decreased bioactive GA levels..
   - **PAD** was universally expressed in rice tissues from the vegetative to reproductive growth stages, especially in seedlings, nodes and rachillae..
   - Plasma Membrane Ca2+ Permeable Mechanosensitive Channel **OsDMT1** Is Involved in Regulation of Plant Architecture and Ion Homeostasis in Rice..
   - Here, we isolated and characterized a T-DNA insertion rice mutant **OsDMT1** (Oryza sativa dwarf and multi-tillering1) that exhibited a severe dwarf phenotype and multi-tillering.
