## Gene Details:
- **MSU gene ID:** [LOC_Os08g44590](http://rice.uga.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os08g44590)  
- **RAPdb gene ID:** [Os08g0560000](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/locus/?name=Os08g0560000)  
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SLC1</u>
- **Gene Name:**
- **Genome:**  [MSU7](http://rice.uga.edu/),&nbsp;&nbsp;[IRGSP-1.0](https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/irgsp1.html)
- **Species:** *Oryza sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Down-regulation of **SLC1** and SLC2 at the same time in the **SLC1**-SLC2 RNAi lines resulted in a severe defect in early leaf development.
   - Two dioxygenases, **SLC1** and SLC2, play essential roles in shoot development of rice.
   - Here, we report that two dioxygenase-encoding genes, **SLC1** (slender and crinklyleaf 1) and SLC2 (slender and crinklyleaf 2), play essential roles in shoot development and SA production in rice (Oryza sativa).
   - Collectively, our data revealed the importance of **SLC1** and SLC2 in the shoot development of rice.
   - Disruption of **SLC1** or SLC2 led to dwarf plants.
   - Enhanced SA level in the **SLC1**-OE plants and decreased SA level in the **SLC1** and slc2 mutants were scored.
