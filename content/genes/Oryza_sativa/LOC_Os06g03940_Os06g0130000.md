## Functional Descriptions:
   - The rice (Oryza sativa L.) LESION MIMIC RESEMBLING, which encodes an AAA-type ATPase, is implicated in defense response..
   - The pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PBZ1 and PR1 were induced in **LMR**, which also showed enhanced resistance to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae) and bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), suggesting **LMR** is a negative regulator of cell death in rice..
   - The Multivesicular Bodies (MVBs)-Localized AAA ATPase **LRD6-6** Inhibits Immunity and Cell Death Likely through Regulating MVBs-Mediated Vesicular Trafficking in Rice..
   - Here we report the identification and characterization of a MVBs-localized AAA ATPase **LRD6-6** in rice.
   - The ATPase activity and homo-dimerization of **LRD6-6** is essential for its regulation on plant immunity and cell death.
   - Collectively, our study shows that the AAA ATPase **LRD6-6** inhibits plant immunity and cell death most likely through modulating MVBs-mediated vesicular trafficking in rice.
   - Disruption of **LRD6-6** leads to enhanced immunity and cell death in rice.
   - The **LRD6-6** protein co-localizes with the MVBs marker protein RabF1/ARA6 and interacts with ESCRT-III components OsSNF7 and OsVPS2.
   - Further analysis reveals that **LRD6-6** is required for MVBs-mediated vesicular trafficking and inhibits the biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds.
