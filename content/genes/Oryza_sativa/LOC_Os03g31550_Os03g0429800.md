## Functional Descriptions:
   - ), an **OsXDH** over-expression transgenic line (OE9), and an **OsXDH** RNA interference line (Ri3) during different growth stages.
   - The expression patterns of the **OsXDH** gene confirmed that XDH was involved in the regulation of normal and abiotic stress-induced ageing processes in rice.
   - These results indicated that **OsSAC3** played a vital role in leaf senescence by regulating carbon metabolism in rice.
   - Moreover, carbohydrate distribution was changed, leading to the accumulation of sucrose and starch in the leaves containing **OsSAC3** on account of decreased expression of OsSWEET3a, OsSWEET6a and OsSWEET14 and oxidized inactivation of starch degradation enzymes in **OsSAC3**.
   - Based on map-based cloning, **OsSAC3** was identified, which encodes the xanthine dehydrogenase.
   - **OsSAC3** was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues and the **OsSAC3** protein located in the cytoplasm.
   - Transcriptional analysis revealed purine metabolism, chlorophyll metabolism, photosynthesis, sugar metabolism and redox balance were affected in the **OsSAC3** mutant.
