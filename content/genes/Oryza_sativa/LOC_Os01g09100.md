## Functional Descriptions:
   - Assays of disease in **OsWRKY10**KD and OsWRKY88KD lines following infection with an incompatible Xoo race, which induced Xa1-mediated resistance in wild-type plants, showed that **OsWRKY10** and OsWRKY88 were positive regulators of Xa1-mediated resistance.
   - Two transcriptional regulatory cascades of **OsWRKY10** were identified in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance.
   - These **OsWRKY10** transcriptional regulatory cascades played important roles in basal defense and Xa1-mediated resistance to enable the mounting of a rapid immune response against pathogens.
   - **OsWRKY10** also acted as a positive regulator in basal defense by directly or indirectly activating transcription of defense-related genes.
   - In the first transcriptional regulatory cascade, OsWRKY47 acted downstream of **OsWRKY10** whereas OsWRKY51 acted upstream.
   - The transcription factor **OsWRKY10** inhibits phosphate uptake via suppressing OsPHT1;2 expression under phosphate-replete condition in rice.
   - Here, we functionally characterized a transcription factor in rice (Oryza sativa), **OsWRKY10**.
   - In accordance with this phenotype, **OsWRKY10** was transcriptionally induced by Pi, and a subset of Phosphate Transporter 1 (PHT1) genes were up-regulated upon its mutation, suggesting that **OsWRKY10** is a transcriptional repressor in Pi uptake.
   - Moreover, rice plants expressing the **OsWRKY10**-VP16 fusion protein (a dominant transcriptional activator) accumulated even more Pi than **OsWRKY10**.
   - Knockout of **OsWRKY10** led to increased Pi uptake and accumulation under Pi-replete condition.
   - Genetic analysis showed that OsPHT1;2 was responsible for the increased Pi accumulation in **OsWRKY10**.
   - Furthermore, during Pi starvation, **OsWRKY10** protein was degraded through the 26S proteasome.
