## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Ghir_D04G017310]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhGASL3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [TM-1 genome (HAU-AD1_genome_v1.0_v1.1)]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - GhACT1 and **GhGASL3**, reported to have clear functions, were, respectively, located in qFE-A05-4 and qFE-D04-3, two stable QTLs for FE. This study revealed the genetic basis of important agronomic traits of Upland cotton, and the results will facilitate molecular breeding in cotton.
   - The gene **GhGASL3** in qFE-D04-3 has also been reported to be related to the development of cotton fibers and had significant expression differences between light seed mutants and wild type.
   - Most of the functions reported for these genes were related to fiber development, and genes such as GhACT1, GhCaM7, **GhGASL3**, GhMADS14, GhMYB25, GhPRF1_A, GhSusA1 and GhPHYA1 were located in QTLs for fiber quality or fiber yield traits.
