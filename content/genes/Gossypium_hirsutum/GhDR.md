## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[GH_A09G2280]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhDR</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [reference genome TM-1_ZJU_v2.1]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A 2-bp frameshift deletion at **GhDR**, which encodes a B-BOX protein that co-segregates with the dwarf-red phenotype in Gossypium hirsutums L.
   - As further evidence that GH_A09G2280 is the best candidate of **GhDR**, of the 25 genes in the mapping interval, GH_A09G2280 was annotated as a homolog of Arabidopsis BBX24, a gene reported to be associated with hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin accumulation.
   - Based on gene annotation and expression changes between the mutant and normal plants, GH_A09G2280 was considered to be the best candidate gene responsible for the dwarf and red mutant phenotypes.
