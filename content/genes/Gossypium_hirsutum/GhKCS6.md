## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Ghicr24_A05G103300.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** GhKCS6
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [ZM24_genome_assembly_V1.0]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **GhKCS6**-RNAi lines exhibited a significant decrease in fiber length when compared to the control suggesting that the sORF-associated **GhKCS6** gene plays a significant role in regulating fiber length in cotton
   - We identified the Ghicr24_A05G103300.1 gene, which encodes a 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6 (**GhKCS6**), associated with sORF that showed peaks of high expression and P-sites at 5 and 10 DPA fiber tissues compared to 20 DPA fiber tissues of normal fiber ZM24 cotton plant.
   - These findings were further supported by the overexpression and knockdown of **GhKCS6**, a gene associated with sORFs in cotton, and demonstrated the potential regulation of the mechanism governing fiber elongation on both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
   - **GhKCS6** overexpression showed greater fiber length than the control and validated our approach.
