## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Gh_A10G0304]()
- **Gene Symbol:** GhARF3
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [genomes of G.hirsutum TM-1]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Description:
   - Gh_A10G0304, which encodes auxin response factor 3 (**GhARF3**) and is homologous to AT2G33860 in Arabidopsis.
   - The auxin response factor gene (**GhARF3**) located in inherited IBD segments from 108Ф and 611Б was highly correlated with fibre quality.
   - **GhARF3** was pedigree-selected from the former Soviet Union foundation parents.
