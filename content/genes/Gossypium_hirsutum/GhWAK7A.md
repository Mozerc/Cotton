## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Gh A02G0727]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhWAK7A</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [G. hirsutum (AD1)]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Cotton Wall-Associated Kinase **GhWAK7A** Mediates Responses to Fungal Wilt Pathogens by Complexing with the Chitin Sensory Receptors.
   - Identified Gossypium hirsutum **GhWAK7A**, a wall-associated kinase, that positively regulates cotton response to both Vd and Fov infections. Chitin, the major constituent of the fungal cell wall, is perceived by lysin-motif-containing RLKs (LYKs/CERK1), leading to the activation of plant defense against fungal pathogens.
   - **GhWAK7A** directly interacts with both GhLYK5 and GhCERK1 and promotes chitin-induced GhLYK5-GhCERK1 dimerization.
   - **GhWAK7A** phosphorylates GhLYK5, which itself does not have kinase activity, but requires phosphorylation for its function. Consequently, **GhWAK7A** plays a crucial role in chitin-induced responses
