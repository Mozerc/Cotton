## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Gh_D11G206800]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhKRP6</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [G. hirsutum genome (CRI)]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor **GhKRP6**, a direct target of GhBES1.4, participates in BR regulation of cell expansion in cotton.
   - The study found that **GhKRP6** was significantly induced by the BR hormone and that GhBES1.4 directly promoted the expression of **GhKRP6** by binding to the CACGTG motif in its promoter region.
   - **GhKRP6**-silenced cotton plants had smaller leaves with more cells and reduced cell size.
   - Furthermore, endoreduplication was inhibited, which affected cell expansion and ultimately decreased fiber length and seed size in **GhKRP6**-silenced plants compared with the control.
   - Our study also found that **GhKRP6** could interact directly with a cell cycle-dependent kinase called GhCDKG. Taken together, these results suggest that BR signaling influences cell expansion by directly modulating the expression of cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor **GhKRP6** via GhBES1.4.
