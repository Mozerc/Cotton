## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[]()
- **Gene Symbol:** GhCAS
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Cotton Genome Database]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhCAS**, GhAPX, GhSDH, and GhPOD, were cloned from cotton complementary DNA, and their expression patterns under stress were analyzed.
   - **GhCAS** thus has a function similar to that in Arabidopsis and rice, namely, slowing down transpiration, increasing water use efficiency, and improving plant drought resistance when outside temperatures are high.
   - Four stress-related genes identified from the library, designated as **GhCAS**, GhAPX, GhSDH, and GhPOD, were cloned from cotton complementary DNA, and their expression patterns under stress were analyzed.
