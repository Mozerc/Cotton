## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb249020](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb249020)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>YS1</u>&nbsp;<u>ZmYS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** yellow stripe1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Yellow stripe 1 (**YS1**) and ys3 are recessive mutants of maize (Zea mays L.) that result in symptoms typical of Fe deficiency, i.e., interveinal chlorosis of the leaves. The **YS1** mutant is defective in the **YS1** transporter and is therefore unable to take up Fe(III)–MAs complexes.
   - The homozygous seeds of Yellow stripe 1 (**YS1**) and ys3 mutant plants were used to identify the genes responsible for the **YS1** and ys3 phenotypes, and to extend our understanding of Fe homeostasis in maize.
   - In agreement with previous reports, the expression level of **YS1** was decreased in the **YS1** mutant. Moreover, we identified that the expression level of a homolog of TOM1 in maize (ZmTOM1) was significantly decreased in the ys3 mutant.
   - Immunostaining showed that **ZmYS1** was localized in the epidermal cells of both crown and lateral roots, with a polar localization at the distal side of the epidermal cells. In maize leaves, ZmYS1 was localized in mesophyll cells, but not epidermal cells.
   - These differences in gene expression pattern and tissue-type specificity of localization suggest that HvYS1 is only involved in primary Fe acquisition by barley roots, whereas **ZmYS1** is involved in both primary Fe acquisition and intracellular transport of iron and other metals in maize.
