## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb058460]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGLK44
- **Gene Name:** G2-like-transcription factor 44
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Comprehensive genetic and molecular studies reveal the roles and mechanisms of two hub genes,ZmBx12 and **ZmGLK44**, in regulating maize metabolite biosynthesis and drought tolerance.
   - ZmBx12 and **ZmGLK44**, for their role in regulating benzoxazinoids and tryptophan biosynthesis as well as maize drought tolerance via comprehensive genetic and molecular methods.
   - We further verified two hub candidate genes,ZmBx12 and **ZmGLK44**, for their role in regulating benzoxazinoids and tryptophan biosynthesis as well as maize drought tolerance via comprehensive genetic and molecular methods. Our results provide novel insights into the genetic bases of metabolome-mediated drought adaptation in a crop.
   - Based on our data sets, **ZmGLK44** is a hub gene correlated / associated with 30 drought-responsive metabolites. Eight of these are annotated amino acids. To elucidate the roles of **ZmGLK44** in regulating the biosynthesis of these drought-responsive metabolites, we generated **ZmGLK44** inducible overexpression transgene maize lines.
