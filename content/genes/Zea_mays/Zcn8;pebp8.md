## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb353250]()
- **Gene Symbol:** Zcn8;pebp8
- **Gene Name:** phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein8
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Map-based cloning and association mapping revealed that Tin8, corresponding to **Zcn8** encoding a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding-related kinase, is down-regulated in transcription, which results in decreased tiller number.
   - Our results support the existence of a complex gene regulatory network for the outgrowth of the tiller bud in maize, in which **Zcn8** controls 13 tiller-related genes, including four genes for hormonal responses. In particular, **Zcn8** represses Gt1, D14, and Tru1 through the interaction with Tb1.
   - The promoter element in the **Zcn8** promoter repressed **Zcn8** transcription and thus decreased tiller number in maize
   - Our dual-luciferase assays further revealed that the signals of Gt1 and D14 were repressed again when the effectors **Zcn8** and Tb1 were co-introduced in comparison to when only the effector **Zcn8** was introduced. These results suggested that **Zcn8**, encoding a PEBP kinase, might repress the downstream genes Gt1 and D14 via the key transcription factor Tb1.
