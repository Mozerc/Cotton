## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb030570]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmXLG1;xlg1
- **Gene Name:** extra-large guanine nucleotide-binding protein1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - XLGs play roles in maize and rice growth, development, and stress responses. XLGs regulate agronomic traits such as plant height, tiller and panicle number, heading time, and grain size/shape, and affect tolerance of both abiotic and biotic stresses; combined knockout of three XLGs can lead to seedling lethality.
   - XLGs have both redundant and specific roles in the control of agronomically relevant plant architecture and resistance to both abiotic and biotic stresses.
   - **ZmXLG1** mutant knockout has reduced plant height; triple mutants are lethal at the seedling stage.
