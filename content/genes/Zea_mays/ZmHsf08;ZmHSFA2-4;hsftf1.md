## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb100770]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmHsf08;ZmHSFA2-4;hsftf1
- **Gene Name:** HSF-transcription factor 1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmHsf08** was highly homologous to SbHsfB1, BdHsfB1, and OsHsfB1, and has no transcriptional activation activity. The expression profiles demonstrated that **ZmHsf08** was differentially expressed in various organs of maize and was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment.
   - The overexpression of **ZmHsf08** in maize resulted in enhanced sensitivity to salt and drought stresses, displaying lower survival rates, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) contents compared with wild-type (WT) plants.
   - **ZmHsf08** negatively regulates a number of stress/ABA-responsive genes under salt and drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that **ZmHsf08** plays a negative role in response to salt and drought stresses in maize.
