## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[GRMZM2G154414]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmICK8;KRP3;cki8
- **Gene Name:** cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor8
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmICK8** is unique compared with the other seven ZmICK genes. **ZmICK8** also has unique characteristics in terms of genetic structure and conserved motifs.
   - The cloned **ZmICK8** contained an insertion element, which results in early termination of translation and loss of the conserved CDI region. We cloned the **ZmICK8** genes from three other inbred lines and found the same early termination insertion.
   - As the conserved C-terminal region is required for CDK-inhibiting function16, **ZmICK8** is considered a pseudo member of the maize ICK/KRP family, similar to OsICK7. OsICK7 lacks the conserved C-terminal CDK- and cyclin-binding region but shares similarities with other rice ICK/KRP sequences in the N-terminal region8 and is also considered a pseudogene.
