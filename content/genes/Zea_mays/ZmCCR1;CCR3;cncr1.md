## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb041120](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb041120)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCCR1;CCR3;cncr1
- **Gene Name:** cinnamoyl CoA reductase1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase 1 (CCR1) mutant in maize: effects on lignification, fibre development, and global gene expression.
   - **ZmCCR1**â€“ exhibited enhanced digestibility without compromising plant growth and development.
   - Whereas **ZmCCR1** was preferentially expressed in all lignifying tissues, ZmCCR2 was detected mainly in roots and it was shown to be induced by drought conditions.
