## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb157040]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmTLP3;tubtf15
- **Gene Name:** TUB-transcription factor 15
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Three genes (**ZmTLP3**, 8, and 9) responded to both low and high temperature treatment, suggesting that they play a role in improving plant adaptation to temperature changes.
   - we also found that a duplicate genes pair (**ZmTLP3**/4) exhibited similar expression patterns, suggesting that these duplicated genes may be involved in the same regulatory pathway in the response to abiotic stress.
