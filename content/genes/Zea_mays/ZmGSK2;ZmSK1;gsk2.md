## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb338190]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGSK2;ZmSK1;gsk2
- **Gene Name:** glycogen synthase kinase2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **Zm**gsk2**** was highly and ubiquitously expressed in maize tissues. Heterologous expression of **Zm**gsk2**** carrying a point mutation in Arabidopsis resulted in a stunted growth phenotype, which could be partially rescued by bikinin, a strong activator of BR signaling. Growth responses of maize roots and aerial parts were affected when seedling roots were treated with epibrassinolide or bikinin.
   - Our results suggest that **Zm**gsk2**** is the ortholog of BIN2 and plays a critical role in mediating BR signaling. This study highlights the function of BR pathway key member in maize development and site-directed mutation of **Zm**gsk2**** TREE domain, which extends a strategy to manipulate BR signaling in maize.
   - In this study, we identified **Zm**gsk2**** as the maize ortholog of BIN2 and point mutation of **Zm**gsk2**** showed a bri1-like phenotype similar with other BR signaling mutants.
