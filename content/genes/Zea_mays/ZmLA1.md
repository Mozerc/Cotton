## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb169480]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmLA1
- **Gene Name:** lazy plant1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmLA1** might mediate the cross talk between shoot gravitropism and inflorescence development by regulating auxin transport, auxin signaling, and probably light response in maize.
   - **ZmLA1** is involved in shoot gravitropism and inflorescence development through the regulation of PAT and auxin signaling in maize.
   - **ZmLA1** Regulates Both Ear and Tassel Development.
