## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb211390]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmLAZ1-4;laz4
- **Gene Name:** lazarus ortholog4
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Zinc Transporter **ZmLAZ1-4** Modulates Zinc Homeostasis on Plasma and Vacuolar Membrane in Maize.
   - Heterologous expression of **ZmLAZ1-4** in the zinc-sensitive yeast mutant, Arabidopsis, and maize significantly facilitated the accumulation of Zn2+ in transgenic lines, respectively. The result of subcellular localization exhibited that **ZmLAZ1-4** was localized on the plasma and vacuolar membrane, as well as chloroplast.
   - **ZmLAZ1-4** was a novel zinc transporter on plasma and vacuolar membrane, and transported zinc under negative regulation of the ZmBES1/BZR1-11 transcription factor. The study provides insights into further underlying the mechanism of **ZmLAZ1-4** regulating zinc homeostasis.
