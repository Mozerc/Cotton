## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb176800]()
- **Gene Symbol:** bt2
- **Gene Name:** brittle endosperm2
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The BRITTLE ENDOSPERM2 (Bt2) gene, previously reported to be involved in maize kernel development, was located in this region. Maize Bt2 gene encoded the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), the first rate-limiting enzyme in the starch biosynthetic pathway of higher plants.
   - Our results indicated that the shrunken kernel in 5601Q was caused by the loss-of-function of Bt2 gene, which provided a new germplasm resource to elucidate the mechanism of maize Bt2 gene in endosperm storage substance accumulation.
