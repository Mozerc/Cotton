## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb006360]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmABI7;abi7
- **Gene Name:** ABI3-VP1-transcription factor 7
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Two important TFs, **Zm**abi7**** and ZmMYB117, which regulate the cell cycle and cell wall modification by directly binding to the promoters of their target genes ZmCYC1, ZmCYC3, ZmCYC7, and ZmCPP1.
   - **Zm**abi7****, as a member of the ABI3-VP1-transcription factor family, plays an important role in the regulation of ABA signaling, seed germination, seedling growth, and plant height.
   - **Zm**abi7**** controlled the normal division of internode cells through its effects on genes related to the cell cycle, thereby controlling internode elongation.
