## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[GRMZM2G099056]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmRTH1
- **Gene Name:** roothairless 1
- **Genome:** [B73 RefGen_v3]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The rth1 gene associates the homologs of exocyst subunits to an exocytotic process in plant development and supports the hypothesis that exocyst-like proteins are involved in plant exocytosis. 
   - RTH1 gene, which is instrumental in the exocytotic tip growth of root hairs.
