## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb294030]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmHDT103;Zm-HD2c;HDT3;hdt103
- **Gene Name:** histone deacetylase103
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **Zm**hdt103**** Negatively Regulates Drought Stress Tolerance in Maize Seedlings.
   - Under drought conditions, the seedlings of **Zm**hdt103**** mutants exhibited significantly lower water loss rate (WLR), relative electrolytic leakage (REL), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) level, and malonaldehyde (MDA) level than those of their wild-type (WT) counterparts.
   - the seedlings of **Zm**hdt103**** mutants exhibited significantly higher levels of abscisic acid (ABA), relative water content (RWC), peroxidase (POD), and proline (Pro) than those of the WT control. These findings indicate that **Zm**hdt103**** acts as a negative regulator of drought tolerance in maize.
