## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb118540](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb118540)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmCIPK8</u>
- **Gene Name:** calcineurin B-like-interacting protein kinase8
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - GUS gene expression driven by the **ZmCIPK8** promoter was in an organ-dependent pattern and induced in Arabidopsis seedlings under drought stress.
   - Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA accumulation of **ZmCIPK8** in maize leaves and roots was promoted by drought stress.
   - **ZmCIPK8**, a CBL-interacting protein kinase, regulates maize response to drought stress.
   - **ZmCIPK8** perhaps is involved in plant response to drought and other abiotic stress through regulating stress-related genes.
   - **ZmCIPK8** is involved in maize response to drought stress.
