## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb005840]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCT2;ct2
- **Gene Name:** compact plant2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The maize heterotrimeric G protein α subunit COMPACT PLANT2 (**ct2**) functions with CLV receptors to regulate meristem development. In addition to the sole canonical Gα **ct2**, maize also contains three eXtra Large GTP-binding proteins (XLGs), which have a domain with homology to Gα as well as additional domains.
   - For example, we show that expression of a constitutively active **ct2** resulted in higher spikelet density and kernel row number, larger ear inflorescence meristems (IMs) and more upright leaves, all beneficial traits selected during maize improvement.
   - We demonstrate that **ct2** and XLGs have both redundant and specialized functions in regulating shoot development. Importantly, we show that a constitutively active Gα functioned as a weak allele, which introduced multiple desirable agronomic traits, such as improved kernel row number and reduced leaf angle.
