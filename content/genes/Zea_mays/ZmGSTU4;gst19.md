## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb277280]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGSTU4;gst19
- **Gene Name:** glutathione transferase19
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Speculated that there were more highly expressed ZmGSTF4 that belonged to Tau classes in the tolerant maize plants than the sensitive ones, and they were greatly involved in the responses to nicosulfuron stress.
   - We speculated that nicosulfuron sensitivity in maize was greatly associated with glutathione S-transferases.
   - **ZmGSTU4** encodes a glutathione S-transferase subunit 19.
