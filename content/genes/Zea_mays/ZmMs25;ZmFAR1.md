## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001d048337]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmMs25;ZmFAR1
- **Gene Name:** male sterile25
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmMs25** encoding a plastid-localized fatty acyl reductase is critical for anther and pollen development in maize.
   - **ZmMs25** was predominantly expressed in anther, and was directly regulated by transcription factor ZmMYB84. Lipidomics analysis revealed that ms25 mutation had significant effects on reducing cutin monomers and internal lipids, and altering the composition of cuticular wax in anthers.
   - Loss of function of **ZmMs25** significantly affected the expression of its four paralogous genes and five cloned lipid metabolic male-sterility genes in maize. These data suggest that **ZmMs25** is required for anther development and male fertility, indicating its application potential in maize and other crops.
