## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb414390]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmXTH1;XTHB10;xth1
- **Gene Name:** xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **Zm**xth1****, a new xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase in maize, affects cell wall structure and composition in Arabidopsis thaliana.
   - **Zm**xth1****, has been isolated from a cDNA expression library obtained from the elongation zone of the maize root. The predicted protein has a putative N-terminal signal peptide and possesses the typical domains of this enzyme family, such as a catalytic domain that is homologous to that of Bacillus macerans Î²-glucanase, a putative N-glycosylation motif, and four cysteine residues in the central and C terminal regions of the **Zm**xth1**** protein.
   - **Zm**xth1**** is directed to the cell wall, although weakly bound. Finally, Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing **Zm**xth1**** show slightly increased xyloglucan endohydrolase activity and alterations in the cell wall structure and composition.
