## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb359320]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZMK1;kch5
- **Gene Name:** potassium channel5
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Overexpression of **ZMK1** also significantly increased K+ uptake activity in maize, but led to an oversensitive phenotype.
   - Similar to AKT1 regulation, the protein kinase ZmCIPK23 interacted with **ZMK1** and phosphorylated the cytosolic region of **ZMK1**, activating **ZMK1**-mediated K+ uptake.
   - In this study, we show that K+ channel **ZMK1** plays important roles in K+ uptake and homeostasis in maize. Similar to AKT1, **ZMK1** is activated by the ZmCBL1-ZmCIPK23 protein kinase complex.
