## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb428800]()
- **Gene Symbol:** Hsftf20
- **Gene Name:** HSF-transcription factor 20
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - This result suggests that the down-regulation of heat-response **Hsftf20** and HSP90 in crown tissues was associated with chilling tolerance. It also suggests that up-regulation of the heat response is associated with chilling susceptibility in leaves.
   - **Hsftf20** encodes a heat shock factor.
   - Besides breeding approaches, augmented production of heat shock factors (HSFs) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been reported in transgenic maize to provide heat stress tolerance.
