## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb256270]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCOP1;ZmCOP1a;upl13
- **Gene Name:** ubiquitin-protein ligase13
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - We found that the mesocotyl lengths of **ZmCOP1** loss-of-function mutants were shorter than those of wild-type B73 in darkness, while the mesocotyl lengths of lines with **ZmCOP1** overexpression were longer than those of wild-type B104.
   - **ZmCOP1** functions in the elongation of etiolated seedlings in darkness and affects plant height in light. Our data can be applied in the improvement of maize plant architecture.
   - **ZmCOP1** regulates a wide range of KEGG pathways, such as those for MAPK hormone signal transduction, ribosome formation, RNA transport, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.
