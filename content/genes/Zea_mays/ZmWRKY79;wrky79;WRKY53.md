## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb310270]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmWRKY79;wrky79;WRKY53
- **Gene Name:** WRKY-transcription factor 79
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Maize WRKY Transcription Factor **Zm**wrky79**** Positively Regulates Drought Tolerance through Elevating ABA Biosynthesis.
   - **Zm**wrky79**** was identified as the regulator of maize phytoalexin biosynthesis with inducible expression under different elicitation.
   - This study substantiates the role of **Zm**wrky79**** in the drought-tolerance mechanism through regulating ABA biosynthesis, suggesting its broad functions not only as the regulator in phytoalexin biosynthesis against pathogen infection but also playing the positive role in abiotic stress response, which provides a WRKY candidate gene to improve drought tolerance for maize and other crop plants.
