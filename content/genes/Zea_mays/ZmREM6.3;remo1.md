## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb008420](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb008420)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmREM6.3;remo1
- **Gene Name:** remorin1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest a role for **ZmREM6.3** in quantitative disease resistance.
   - Transposon tagging mutants were tested for the chaperonin and **ZmREM6.3**, and the remorin mutant was found to be more susceptible to NLB. The putative F-box is a strong candidate, but mutants were not available to test this gene.
   - **ZmREM6.3**,a remorin gene in maize, involved in quantitative resistance against northern leaf.
   - We demonstrate a role for a maize remorin (**ZmREM6.3**) in quantitative resistance against northern leaf blight using high-resolution fine mapping, expression analysis, and mutants.
   - **ZmREM6.3** appears to have a specific effect on NLB disease development.
