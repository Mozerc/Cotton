## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb228530]()
- **Gene Symbol:** Sbe1;sbe1a;spe1
- **Gene Name:** starch branching enzyme1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Centered within the 5S QTL interval is another starch branching enzyme, starch branching enzyme 1 (**Sbe1**), which also plays a role in the branching of amylopectin.
   - Kernels were genotyped for **Sbe1** alleles and assayed for relative amylose and amylopectin content. Kernels heterozygous or homozygous for the GEMS-0067 allele of **Sbe1** had a higher amylose/amylopectin ratio than kernels possessing the H99ae allele.
   - **Sbe1**-Mu behaves as a simple recessive allele regardless of the other **Sbe1** allele. This implicates allelic variation of **Sbe1** as being responsible for the high endosperm amylose QTL.
