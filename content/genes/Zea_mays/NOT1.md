## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb175190]()
- **Gene Symbol:** NOT1
- **Gene Name:** neighbor of tga1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Glume architecture phenotypes of isogenic lines with different genotypes at tga1 and not1.
   - **NOT1** regulates the development of strut roots in the first four to six segments of the stem.
   - Glume length was significantly increased when TGA1/**NOT1** were knocked down/out.
