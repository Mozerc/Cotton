## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb175190](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb175190)
- **Gene Symbol:** NOT1
- **Gene Name:** neighbor of tga1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **NOT1** encodes a protein that has 92% amino acid similarity to TGA1 and that is recognized by the TGA1 antibody. 
   - Genetic mapping and phenotypic data show that tga1, without a contribution from **NOT1**, controls the difference in covered vs. naked kernels.
   - Glume architecture phenotypes of isogenic lines with different genotypes at tga1 and **NOT1**.
   - **NOT1** regulates the development of strut roots in the first four to six segments of the stem.
   - Glume length was significantly increased when TGA1/**NOT1** were knocked down/out.
