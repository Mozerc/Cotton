## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb145660](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb145660)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZMM16</u>&nbsp;<u>ZmMADS16</u>&nbsp;<u>sts1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Zea mays MADS16
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We demonstrate that **ZMM16**/STS1, as well as its paralogs ZMM18 and ZMM29, form obligate heterodimers with the maize AP3/DEF ortholog SILKY1 and that **ZMM16**/sts1 and silky1 (si1) are involved in positive regulation of all four of the maize B class genes.
   - Previous analysis of maize B class function showed that SI1 and **ZMM16**/STS1 interact as obligate heterodimers.
   - It is surprising that mutation of sts1 alone is sufficient to produce a strong loss of B function phenotype and suggests that Zmm18 and Zmm29 are not fully functionally redundant with **ZMM16**/sts1.
   - **ZMM16** strongly expressed in developing male and female inflorescences but wealky expressed indeveloping kernels.
   - **ZMM16** mutants have a sterile tassel silky ear phenotype.
