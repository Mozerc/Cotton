## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb145660]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZMM16;ZmMADS16;sts1
- **Gene Name:** Zea mays MADS16
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - We demonstrate that **ZMM16**/**sts1**, as well as its paralogs ZMM18 and ZMM29, form obligate heterodimers with the maize AP3/DEF ortholog SILKY1 and that **ZMM16**/**sts1** and silky1 (si1) are involved in positive regulation of all four of the maize B class genes.
   - Previous analysis of maize B class function showed that SI1 and **ZMM16**/**sts1** interact as obligate heterodimers.
   - It is surprising that mutation of **sts1** alone is sufficient to produce a strong loss of B function phenotype and suggests that Zmm18 and Zmm29 are not fully functionally redundant with **ZMM16**/**sts1**.
