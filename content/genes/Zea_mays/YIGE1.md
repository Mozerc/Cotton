## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb014970]()
- **Gene Symbol:** YIGE1
- **Gene Name:** yige1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Overexpression of **YIGE1** increased female inflorescence meristem (IM) size, increased EL and kernel number per row (KNPR), and thus enhanced grain yield.
   - **YIGE1** may be involved in sugar and auxin signal pathways to regulate maize ear development, thus affecting IM activity and floret production in maize inflorescence morphogenesis.
   - Here, using a genome wide association study (GWAS), we identified a QTL, **YIGE1**, which encodes an unknown protein that regulates EL by affecting pistillate floret number.
   - A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the regulatory region of **YIGE1** had a large effect on its promoter strength, which positively affected EL by increasing gene expression.
   - Further analysis shows that **YIGE1** may be involved in sugar and auxin signal pathways to regulate maize ear development, thus affecting IM activity and floret production in maize inflorescence morphogenesis.
