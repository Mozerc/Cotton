## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb038200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCEP1
- **Gene Name:** C-terminally encoded peptide1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Here, we examined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of **ZmCEP1** and showed that **ZmCEP1** is highly expressed in young ears and tassels of maize, particularly in the vascular bundles of ears. Heterologous expression of **ZmCEP1** in Arabidopsis results in smaller plants and seed size.
   - Similarly, overexpression of **ZmCEP1** in maize decreased the plant and ear height, ear length, kernel size, and 100-kernel weight. Consistently, exogenous application of the synthesized **ZmCEP1** peptide to the roots of Arabidopsis and maize inhibited root elongation. Knock-out of **ZmCEP1** through CRISPR/Cas9 significantly increased plant and ear height, kernel size and 100-kernel weight.
   - Transcriptome analysis revealed that knock-out of **ZmCEP1** up-regulated a subset of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, nitrate transport, sugar transport and auxin response. Thus, these results provide new insights into the genetic and molecular function of **ZmCEP1** in regulating kernel development and plant growth, providing novel opportunities for maize breeding.
