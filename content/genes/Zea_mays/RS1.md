## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb299420]()
- **Gene Symbol:** RS1
- **Gene Name:** Rough sheath1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The **RS1** mutant phenotype is characterized by a disorganized ligular region and the presence of thick, sheath-like tissue at the base of the blade.
   - The affected domain of Rsl mutant leaves has many attributes of sheath tissue; it is thick, rigid and paler green than the blade.
   - Rsl mutants alter cellular identity and organization in leaf tissues.
