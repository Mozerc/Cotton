## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb037120](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb037120)
- **Gene Symbol:** RBR3
- **Gene Name:** retinoblastoma family3
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **RBR3**, a member of the retinoblastoma-related family from maize, is regulated by the RBR1/E2F pathway.
   - We identified a previously undescribed member of the maize RBR family, **RBR3**, which has the characteristic structure and binding activities of pocket proteins, where interaction depends on a LxCxE motif in the partner proteins and a critical cysteine within the B pocket domain.
   - The results indicate that **RBR3** expression is controlled by RBR1 through the activity of E2F/DP and that **RBR3** is the maize equivalent of mammalian p107.
