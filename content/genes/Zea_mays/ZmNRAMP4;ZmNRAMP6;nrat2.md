## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb231210]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmNRAMP4;ZmNRAMP6;nrat2
- **Gene Name:** nramp aluminum transporter2
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - A metal transporter **ZmNRAMP6** was identified by using a trait-associated co-expression network analysis at a genome-wide level. **ZmNRAMP6** confers maize sensitivity to Pb by accumulating it to maize shoots. **ZmNRAMP6** knockout detains Pb in roots, activates antioxidant enzymes, and improves Pb tolerance.
   - **ZmNRAMP6** that encodes a metal transporter was identified as the key gene among the Pb tolerance-associated co-expression module. Heterologous expression of **ZmNRAMP6** in yeast verified its role in Pb transport.
