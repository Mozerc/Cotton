## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb167600](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb167600)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmPme3
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - This gene is a pectin methylesterase (PME), which we designated as **ZmPme3**, and is present and expressed only in Ga1-s genotypes.
   - **ZmPme3** is not present in the ga1 genotypes examined, a pectin methylesterase gene cluster is found in ga1 genotypes.
   - A Pectin Methylesterase **ZmPme3** Is Expressed in Gametophyte factor1-s (Ga1-s) Silks and Maps to that Locus in Maize.
   -  Consistent with this role,a third allele which lacks the female function of Ga1-s, Ga1-m, has a mutationally inactivated version of **ZmPme3**.
   - **ZmPme3** present and expressed only in silks of Ga1-s genotypes; mutationally inactivated version present in Ga1-m.
   - **ZmPme3** is a candidate gene for ga1.
