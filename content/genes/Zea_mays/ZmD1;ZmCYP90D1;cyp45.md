## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb120890]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmD1;ZmCYP90D1;cyp45
- **Gene Name:** cytochrome P450 45
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmD1**, in the regulation of stalk length and thickness.
   - The seed length, width, and hundred-grain weight were slightly reduced in **ZmD1** mutants.
   - The **ZmD1** gene regulated stalk development by influencing cell length and width.
   - The expression trends of **ZmD1** and ZmBZR1 were complementary in maize stalks.
   - Cytochrome P450 D1 (**ZmD1**) and Brassinzole-resistant 1 (ZmBZR1), were identified as hub genes in the elongated stalk network.
   - **ZmCYP90D1** regulates maize internode development by modulating brassinosteroid-mediated cell division and growth.
   - A candidate gene, **ZmCYP90D1**, which encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 family, was isolated by map-based cloning. **ZmCYP90D1** was constitutively expressed and showed highest expression in basal internodes, and its protein was targeted to the nucleus.
