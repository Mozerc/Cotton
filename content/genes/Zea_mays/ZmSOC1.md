## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb403750]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmSOC1
- **Gene Name:** SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - We transformed the **ZmSOC1** into soybean to examine the possible impact of a major MADS-box gene on soybean plant growth and flowering.
   - This consistency suggested that expression of the **ZmSOC1** was able to enhance reproductive production and reduce plant height.
   - Effect of **ZmSOC1** expression on seed quality.
