## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb403750](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb403750)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmSOC1
- **Gene Name:** SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptome analysis in the leaves of 34-day old plants revealed 58 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) responding to the expression of the **ZmSOC1**, of which the upregulated FRUITFULL MADS-box gene, as well as the transcription factor VASCULAR PLANT ONE-ZINC FINGER1, contributed to the promoted flowering.
   - Expression of a maize SOC1 gene enhances soybean yield potential through modulating plant growth and flowering.
   - We transformed the **ZmSOC1** into soybean to examine the possible impact of a major MADS-box gene on soybean plant growth and flowering.
   - This consistency suggested that expression of the **ZmSOC1** was able to enhance reproductive production and reduce plant height.
   - Effect of **ZmSOC1** expression on seed quality.
