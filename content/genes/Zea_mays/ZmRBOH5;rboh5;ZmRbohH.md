## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb341910]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmRBOH5;rboh5;ZmRbohH
- **Gene Name:** respiratory burst oxidase5
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The transcriptional response of ZmRBOH genes was examined under various abiotic stresses, and most of ZmRBOH genes were up-regulated by cold stress.
   - The transcripts of **ZmRBOH5** and ZmRBOH11 were mainly shown in the anther.
   - **ZmRBOH5** and ZmRBOH11 were highly expressed in anthers, and may have special biological functions in pollen development.
