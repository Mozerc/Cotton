## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb271680]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmRNRL2;rnrl2
- **Gene Name:** ribonucleotide reductase large subunit2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - First, ZmRNRL1 and **Zm**rnrl2**** are expressed ubiquitously; second, **Zm**rnrl2**** is expressed at a lower level than ZmRNRL1; and third, ZmRNRL1 and **Zm**rnrl2**** are expressed at higher levels in developing tissues compared to mature tissues.
   - Both results suggest that ZmRNRL1 and **Zm**rnrl2**** expression is sensitive to restrictive temperatures. However, we believed that reduced expression levels of ZmRNRL1 and **Zm**rnrl2**** is not the major factor leading to the no-tassel phenotype of tvt1-R mutants at restrictive temperatures.
   - **Zm**rnrl2**** and ZmRNRL1 proteins have same interaction partners at normal growth temperatures. These results indicate that **Zm**rnrl2**** performs molecular functions similar to ZmRNRL1, although they are expressed at different levels.
