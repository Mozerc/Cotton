## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb156910]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmIAA5;ZmIAA10;rum1;iaa13
- **Gene Name:** rootless with undetectable meristems1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmIAA5** regulates maize root growth and development by interacting with ZmARF5 under the specific binding of ZmTCP15/16/17.
   - In maize overexpressing **ZmIAA5**, the length of the main root, the number of lateral roots, and the stalk height at the seedling stage were significantly increased compared with those of the wild type, while the EMS mutant zmiaa5 was significantly reduced.
   - The total number of roots and the dry weight of maize overexpressing **ZmIAA5** at the mature stage were also significantly increased compared with those of the wild type, while those of the mutant zmiaa5 was significantly reduced. Yeast one-hybrid experiments showed that ZmTCP15/16/17 could specifically bind to the **ZmIAA5** promoter region.
