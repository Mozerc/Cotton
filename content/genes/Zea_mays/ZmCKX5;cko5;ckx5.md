## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb337910]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCKX5;cko5;ckx5
- **Gene Name:** cytokinin oxidase 5
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Markerâ€“trait association analysis in inbred lines identified 12 variants of **Zm**ckx5**** that were significantly associated with six root traits, including seed root number (SRN), lateral root length (LRL), total root area (RA), root length in 0 to 0.5 mm diameter class (RL005), total root volume (RV), and total root length (TRL).
   - These results indicate that **Zm**ckx5**** may be involved in the development of the maize root system and that the significant variants can be used to develop functional markers to accelerate the improvement in the maize root system.
   - **Zm**ckx5**** may be involved in the development of the maize root system, and significant variants were identified that could be used to develop functional markers for improvement in the maize root system.
