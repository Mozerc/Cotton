## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb372610](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb372610)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmMADS60
- **Gene Name:** MADS-transcription factor 60
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmMADS60** be involved in the elongation of primary and lateral roots in the seedling stage and that significant variants can be used to develop functional markers to improve root length in maize.
   - **ZmMADS60** in maize retained only 40.1% and 66.9% of the nucleotide diversity found in teosinte and landrace, respectively. Gene-based association analysis of inbred lines identified nine variants that were significantly associated with primary root length (PRL), lateral root length (LRL), root length between 0 mm and 0.5 mm in diameter (RL005) and total root length (TRL)
   - Natural variations in **ZmMADS60** were significantly associated with total root length (TRL) and lateral root length (LRL).
   - **ZmMADS60** was associated with primary root length (PRL), lateral root length (LRL), root length between 0 and 0.5 mm in diameter (RL005) and total root length (TRL), which indicated that this gene might be involved in elongation of the primary and lateral root in the seedling stage.
