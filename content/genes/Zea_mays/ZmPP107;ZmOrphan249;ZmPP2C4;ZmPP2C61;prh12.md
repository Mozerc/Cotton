## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb294200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmPP107;ZmOrphan249;ZmPP2C4;ZmPP2C61;prh12
- **Gene Name:** protein phosphatase homolog12
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmPP107**, a member of Group A PP2C, was significantly up-regulated in CR and SR, indicating that Group A PP2C may play a part in salt stress except for its role in drought stress condition.
   - These findings suggest that ZmPP2C genes may play crucial roles in biological and abiotic stress.
   - These results suggest that the genes of the ZmPP2C family have different response patterns to nitrogen stress and provide insight into the potential roles of ZmPP2C genes in regulating nitrogen stress responses in maize.
