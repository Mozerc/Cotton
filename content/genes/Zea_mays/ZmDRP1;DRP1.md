## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb267820]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmDRP1;DRP1
- **Gene Name:** Desiccation-Related Protein 1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Maize sterility gene **DRP1** encodes a desiccation-related protein that is critical for Ubisch bodies and pollen exine development.
   - Our results suggest that **DRP1** encodes a desiccation-related protein whose loss of function causes male sterility.
   - We show that **DRP1** has been targeted by selection, suggesting that it may have played a key role in adaptation of the maize anther to desiccation stress.
   - The **DRP1** mutant exhibits a defective tapetum and irregular pollen exine.
