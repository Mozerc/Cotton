## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[GRMZM2G377215]()
- **Gene Symbol:** RTH3
- **Gene Name:** roothairless 3
- **Genome Version:** [B73 RefGen_v3]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **RTH3** root response differences at high P indicated that the P application reduced the dependence of the plants on specific root traits to obtain nutrients.
   - For the rth3 mutant (without root hairs), maize growth will be facilitated by complementary functional traits (more intense root proliferation) in the nutrient-rich patch; functional compensation effects of root traits are expected to be repressed at high P supply in comparison to P deficiency.

## Literature:
