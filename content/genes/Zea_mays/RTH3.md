## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb014120](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb014120)
- **Gene Symbol:** RTH3
- **Gene Name:** roothairless 3
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **RTH3** root response differences at high P indicated that the P application reduced the dependence of the plants on specific root traits to obtain nutrients.
   - For the **RTH3** mutant (without root hairs), maize growth will be facilitated by complementary functional traits (more intense root proliferation) in the nutrient-rich patch; functional compensation effects of root traits are expected to be repressed at high P supply in comparison to P deficiency.
   - The root response ratio of **RTH3** was greater than that of WT at low P, but could not completely compensate for the loss of root hairs.
   - The disappearance of WT and **RTH3** root response differences at high P indicated that the P application reduced the dependence of the plants on specific root traits to obtain nutrients.
   - Maize lacking root hairs (**RTH3**) increased mycorrhizal colonization in P-limited soil to obtain more P.
