## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb036920]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmNAC48
- **Gene Name:** NAC-transcription factor 48
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - A natural antisense transcript acts as a negative regulator for the maize drought stress response gene **ZmNAC48**.
   - Arabidopsis plants overexpressing **ZmNAC48** had improved drought tolerance, lower rate of water loss, enhanced stomatal closure, and higher rates of survival. Transient expression in both maize protoplasts and tobacco leaves indicated that cis-NAT**ZmNAC48** reduced **ZmNAC48** expression.
   - Taken together, our study indicates that both **ZmNAC48** and cis-NAT**ZmNAC48** are involved in plant drought stress responses, and that the double-stranded RNA-dependent mechanism is involved in the interaction between cis-NAT**ZmNAC48** and **ZmNAC48**. Additionally, cis-NAT**ZmNAC48** may negatively regulate **ZmNAC48** to affect stomatal closure of maize.
   - Overexpression of **ZmNAC48** enhances stomatal closure, conferring drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.
   - cis-NAT**ZmNAC48** and **ZmNAC48** transcripts have the potential to generate nat-siRNAs in response to drought stress.
