## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb060200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** VP8
- **Gene Name:** iviparous8
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **VP8** is mainly expressed in the stem apex, young leaves, and developing vascular tissues, and its expression levels in nodes are significantly higher than that in internodes at 12-leaf stage.
   - Preferential expression of the **VP8** gene in the shoots is correlated with shortened internodes and short, narrowed leaves in the d2003 mutant plants.
   - **VP8** is located in ER and the N terminus plays an important role in its localization and function.

## Literature:
