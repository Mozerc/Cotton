## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[GRMZM5G838324]()
- **Gene Symbol:** CG1
- **Gene Name:** Corngrass1
- **Genome:** [B73 RefGen_v3]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The **CG1** reference allele (**CG1**-R) affects multiple aspects of development, from leaf initiation to floral architecture.
   - These phenotypes suggest that the **CG1** gene and its targets are responsible for initiating the switch from juvenile to adult vegetative development as well as maintaining that switch during floral development.
   - **CG1** increase in number of brace root whorls.
