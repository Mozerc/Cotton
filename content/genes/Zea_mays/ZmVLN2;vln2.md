## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb362860]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmVLN2;vln2
- **Gene Name:** villin-like2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **Zm**vln2**** is the candidate gene in qPVB55 that affects maize VB development.
   - **Zm**vln2**** affect the NSVB and seven other PVB-related traits, which may have been influenced by selection pressures during breeding.
   - A comparison of the PVB-related traits of the **Zm**vln2**** mutant and the **Zm**vln2**** wild-type revealed the **Zm**vln2**** mutant had a significantly smaller peduncle diameter, but there were no significant differences in LEH and LNEH.
   - Natural variations in **Zm**vln2**** affect the NSVB and seven other PVB-related traits, which may have been influenced by selection pressures during breeding.
