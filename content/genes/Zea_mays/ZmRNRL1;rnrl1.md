## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb375490]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmRNRL1;rnrl1
- **Gene Name:** ribonucleotide reductase large subunit1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - First, **Zm**rnrl1**** and ZmRNRL2 are expressed ubiquitously; second, ZmRNRL2 is expressed at a lower level than **Zm**rnrl1****; and third, **Zm**rnrl1**** and ZmRNRL2 are expressed at higher levels in developing tissues compared to mature tissues.
   - Both results suggest that **Zm**rnrl1**** and ZmRNRL2 expression is sensitive to restrictive temperatures. However, we believed that reduced expression levels of **Zm**rnrl1**** and ZmRNRL2 is not the major factor leading to the no-tassel phenotype of tvt1-R mutants at restrictive temperatures.
   - ZmRNRL2 and **Zm**rnrl1**** proteins have same interaction partners at normal growth temperatures. These results indicate that ZmRNRL2 performs molecular functions similar to **Zm**rnrl1****, although they are expressed at different levels.
