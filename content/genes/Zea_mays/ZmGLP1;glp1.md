## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb282040]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGLP1;glp1
- **Gene Name:** germin-like protein1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - A gene encoding a protein similar to germin-like proteins (GLPs) was obtained from maize (Zea mays) and designated as **Zm**glp1****. Based on the **Zm**glp1**** conserved domain and phylogenetic status, **Zm**glp1**** was grouped into GLP subfamily b and has high similarity to OsGLP8-14 from Oryza sativa.
   - **Zm**glp1**** is expressed in different maize tissues during different growth stages and is mainly expressed in the stems and leaves. The induced expression patterns confirmed that **Zm**glp1**** is differentially expressed under abiotic and hormone stress.
   - We speculate that **Zm**glp1**** plays an important role in the regulation of Arabidopsis resistance to biotrophic PstDC3000 and necrotrophic S. sclerotiorum; the regulatory effects are achieved by inducing plant oxidative burst activity and activation of the JA signaling pathway.
