## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb282040](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb282040)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmGLP1</u>&nbsp;<u>glp1</u>
- **Gene Name:** germin-like protein1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A gene encoding a protein similar to germin-like proteins (GLPs) was obtained from maize (Zea mays) and designated as **ZmGLP1**. Based on the **ZmGLP1** conserved domain and phylogenetic status, **ZmGLP1** was grouped into GLP subfamily b and has high similarity to OsGLP8-14 from Oryza sativa.
   - **ZmGLP1** is expressed in different maize tissues during different growth stages and is mainly expressed in the stems and leaves. The induced expression patterns confirmed that **ZmGLP1** is differentially expressed under abiotic and hormone stress.
   - We speculate that **ZmGLP1** plays an important role in the regulation of Arabidopsis resistance to biotrophic PstDC3000 and necrotrophic S. sclerotiorum; the regulatory effects are achieved by inducing plant oxidative burst activity and activation of the JA signaling pathway.
   - **ZmGLP1** over-expression mproved the resistance to pathogens.
