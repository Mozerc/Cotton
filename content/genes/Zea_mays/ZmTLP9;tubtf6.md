## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb188370]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmTLP9;tubtf6
- **Gene Name:** TUB-transcription factor 6
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - For instance, **ZmTLP9** was induced by ABA, 42 and 4 Â°C treatment, while it contains only one type of stress-responsive cis-element in its promoter sequence.
   - The expression patterns of ZmTLP6 and **ZmTLP9** were similar, with relatively high expression levels in the thirteenth leaf and in other tissues.
