## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb088410](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb088410)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGLP2-1;ZmGLP2;glp2
- **Gene Name:** germin-like protein2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The lowest P-sites were found in **ZmGLP2-1**, ZmGLP4-11, and ZmGLP4-12, while the highest ones were found in ZmGLP10-1. Protein phosphorylation regulates various cellular processes in plants including differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis, particularly at threonine, serine, or tyrosine residues.
   - ZmGLP1 and **ZmGLP2-1** exhibited remorin-related enzymatic activities, a plant-specific membrane-localized protein having a role in plant growth and development, signaling, and various stress responses.
   - It also regulates resistance against biotrophic PstDC3000 and necrotrophic S. sclerotiorum via oxidative burst and JA signaling pathway activation in transgenic Arabidopsis. **ZmGLP2-1** contains a ricin B-like lectin (RBL) domain, which protects against Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum (F. graminearum) in wheat87 and other fungal infections.
   - The kernel length was as well as the width was reduced in the **ZmGLP2** mutants.
   - In addition, disruption of **ZmGLP2** (a MEG) by CRISPR/Cas9 also resulted in a smaller kernel phenotype, and thus it might provide an example in support of the maternal-offspring co-adaptation theory, like Meg1.
