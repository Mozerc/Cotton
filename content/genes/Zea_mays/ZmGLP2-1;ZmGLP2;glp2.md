## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb088410]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGLP2-1;ZmGLP2;glp2
- **Gene Name:** germin-like protein2
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The lowest P-sites were found in ****ZmGLP2**-1**, ZmGLP4-11, and ZmGLP4-12, while the highest ones were found in ZmGLP10-1. Protein phosphorylation regulates various cellular processes in plants including differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis, particularly at threonine, serine, or tyrosine residues.
   - ZmGLP1 and ****ZmGLP2**-1** exhibited remorin-related enzymatic activities, a plant-specific membrane-localized protein having a role in plant growth and development, signaling, and various stress responses.
   - It also regulates resistance against biotrophic PstDC3000 and necrotrophic S. sclerotiorum via oxidative burst and JA signaling pathway activation in transgenic Arabidopsis. ****ZmGLP2**-1** contains a ricin B-like lectin (RBL) domain, which protects against Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum (F. graminearum) in wheat87 and other fungal infections.
