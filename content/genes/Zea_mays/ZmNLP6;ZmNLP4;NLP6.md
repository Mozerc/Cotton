## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb118950](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb118950)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmNLP6;ZmNLP4;NLP6
- **Gene Name:** NLP-transcription factor 6
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmNLP6** was located in the overlapping hotspots of chromosomes 3, 5, and 10, but no NUE-related genes were identified and isolated in the overlapping hotspots of chromosomes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
   - **ZmNLP6** encodes a RWP-RK domain containing protein.
   - One Mukiller deletion takes out large portions of three genes (including **NLP6**, amyb4 and acm1) as well as this gene. The plants are homozygous viable, although the plants have a distinct phenotype, including delayed flowering time and somewhat "stumpy" looking tassels.
