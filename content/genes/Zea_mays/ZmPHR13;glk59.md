## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb331010](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb331010)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmPHR13;glk59
- **Gene Name:** G2-like-transcription factor 59
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - ZmPHR genes were eight (ZmPHR3, ZmPHR4, ZmPHR6, ZmPHR7, ZmPHR9, **ZmPHR13**, ZmPHR17 and ZmPHR18) in leaf were up-regulated under low Pi condition (Figs. 7, 8). Together above, 8 of OsPHR genes and 10 of ZmPHR genes were responsive to Pi conditions, suggesting that theses PHR genes probably mainly involved in the regulation of Pi translocation in leaves under different Pi concentration.
   - The previous studies have indicated that phosphate starvation response (PHR) genes play central roles in regulating plant Pi starvation responses.
   - The expression levels of PHR genes from maize and rice under low Pi stress conditions revealed that some PHRs may play an important role in Pi starvation response.
   - **ZmPHR13** probably mainly involved in the regulation of Pi translocation in leaves under different Pi concentration.
