## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb247630](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb247630)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmPAL3b</u>&nbsp;<u>pal9</u>
- **Gene Name:** phenylalanine ammonia lyase9
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmPAL3b** were significantly reduced in F4. Their expressions were thus decreased to 18, 62, and 71% of the expression values observed in the control line F2. The two first ones (ZmPAL3a and ZmPAL3e) were highly expressed in the F2 line in the below-ear internode at silking stage, while the third one (**ZmPAL3b**) was weakly expressed.
   - Considering all genes involved in monolignol biosynthesis, investigations in F4 and F2 lignifying internodes have especially shown that the expressions of three **ZmPAL** genes.
   - The ZmPAL3 genes are considered as those preferentially involved in the monolignol pathway. Other **ZmPAL** genes have been shown in the maize genome since the construction of the used macro-array, of which expression is thus not known, including two genes in close positions to the ZmPAL3a and **ZmPAL3b** genes.
