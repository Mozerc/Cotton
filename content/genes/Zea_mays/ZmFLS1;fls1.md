## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb256020]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmFLS1;fls1
- **Gene Name:** flavonol synthase1
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - We have recently characterized a UV-B inducible **ZmFLS1**, corresponding to the first to be described in monocot plants. Interestingly, the new assembly of the B73 maize genome revealed the presence of a second putative FLS gene (ZmFLS2), with very high identity with **ZmFLS1**.
   - we generated pFLS1::FLS1-RFP transgenic plants and analyzed **ZmFLS1** expression in different maize tissues; we found that this enzyme is localized in the ER and the perinuclear region.
   - The increased expression of ZmFLS genes in the maize landraces from high altitudes could be explained by differences in the activities and/or expression levels of C1+R and P1 regulators in these landraces.
