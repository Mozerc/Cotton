## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb193950]()
- **Gene Symbol:** Dek15;scc4
- **Gene Name:** defective kernel 15
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The **Dek15** mutation was found to disrupt the mitotic cell cycle and endoreduplication, resulting in a reduced endosperm and embryo lethality.
   - **Dek15**/**scc4** in mitotic chromosome segregation and kernel development in maize.
   - **Dek15**/**scc4** is required to precisely regulate chromosome segregation, possibly by interacting with the chromatin remodeling complex to assist cohesin binding to chromatin.
