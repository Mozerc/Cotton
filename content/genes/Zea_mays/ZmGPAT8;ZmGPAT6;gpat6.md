## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb136910](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb136910)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGPAT8;ZmGPAT6;gpat6
- **Gene Name:** glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our study revealed that ZmGPAT14, along with ZmGPAT7, **ZmGPAT8**, and ZmGPAT13, had relatively high levels of transcripts at early seed developmental stages and peaked at 5 DAF, suggesting their possible roles in oil production and seed development in maize.
   - **ZmGPAT8** and ZmGPAT11 were regulated by cold and heat stresses
   - The transcripts of ZmGPAT7, **ZmGPAT8**, ZmGPAT13, and ZmGPAT14 all peaked at the early stage of seed development (5DAF) and maintained high levels of transcription at the middle seed developmental stages (15â€“20 DAF), which might imply their potential roles in maize seed development and oil production.
