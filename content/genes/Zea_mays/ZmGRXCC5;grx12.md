## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb121020](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb121020)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGRXCC5;grx12
- **Gene Name:** glutaredoxin12
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Global maize cultivation is often adversely affected by drought stress. The CC-type glutaredoxin (GRX) genes form a plant-specific subfamily that regulate plant growth and respond to environmental stresses. However, how maize CC-type GRX (ZmGRXCC) genes respond to drought stress remains unclear.
   - **ZmGRXCC5**, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18 were up-regulated above two-fold under drought, salinity, cold and heat, while others were down-regulated or undetected, indicated functional divergence of ZmGRXCCs in maize.
   - These results will help to advance the study of the function of ZmGRXCCs genes under drought stress and understand the mechanism of drought resistance in maize.
