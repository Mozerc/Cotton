## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[GRMZM2G107774]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmREM6.3
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [B73 RefGen_v3]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmREM6.3**,a remorin gene in maize, involved in quantitative resistance against northern leaf.
   - We demonstrate a role for a maize remorin (**ZmREM6.3**) in quantitative resistance against northern leaf blight using high-resolution fine mapping, expression analysis, and mutants.
   - **ZmREM6.3** appears to have a specific effect on NLB disease development.
