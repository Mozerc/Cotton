## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb013100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmMPK3;gpm443;mpk3
- **Gene Name:** MAP kinase3
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - A novel MAPK gene, **Zm**mpk3****, from ABA-treated maize leaves cDNA was isolated and characterized. The full length of the **Zm**mpk3**** gene is 1 520 bp and encodes a 376 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 43.5 kD and a pI of 5.83.
   - **Zm**mpk3**** contains all 11 MAPK conserved subdomains and the phosphorylation motif TEY. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed that **Zm**mpk3**** shared high identity with group-A MAPK in plants.
   - ABA and H2O2 induced a significant increase in the **Zm**mpk3**** activity using immunoprecipitation and in-gel kinase assay. Furthermore, the results showed that the **Zm**mpk3**** protein is localized mainly to the nucleus. These results suggest that the **Zm**mpk3**** may play an important role in response to environmental stresses.
