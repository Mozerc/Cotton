## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb194220]()
- **Gene Symbol:** Ereb17
- **Gene Name:** AP2-EREBP-transcription factor 17
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The Expression of the bZip113 and **Ereb17** Transcription Factor Genes Was Highly Correlated with the Expression of Sucrose Transporters.
   - In contrast, a large cluster with a significant positive correlation includes the **Ereb17** and bZip113 transcription factors, three sucrose transporters (Sut1, Sut2 and Sweet4a), and many other classes of transporters.
   - This cluster was negatively correlated with the AGPase isoforms related to starch synthesis (Agpl3, Agplemzm, Bt2) as well as bGlu1 and bGlu3, which were more expressed in the FI tissue. Overall, sugar transporter genes showed the highest positive correlation with the bZip113 and **Ereb17** transcription factors.
