## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb024330](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb024330)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmMYC2a</u>&nbsp;<u>bhlh149</u>&nbsp;<u>myc7</u>&nbsp;<u>gpm818</u>
- **Gene Name:** myc transcription factor7
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We generated maize mutants in which **ZmMYC2a** and ZmMYC2b, two transcription factor genes important in JA signaling, were individually or both knocked out.
   - ZmMYC2s play important roles in maize responses to simulated herbivory and jasmonate.
   - **ZmMYC2a** and ZmMYC2b played a redundant role in maize resistance to insects and JA signaling.
   - CUT&Tag-Seq and dual luciferase assays revealed that ZmMYC2s transactivate the benzoxazinoid and volatile terpene biosynthesis genes IGPS1/3, BX10/11/12/14, and TPS10/2/3/4/5/8 by directly binding to their promoters.
   - Double mutant with myc7 (**ZmMYC2a**) was highly susceptible to insects, and the levels of benzoxazinoids and volatile terpenes, and the levels of their biosynthesis gene transcripts, were much lower.double mutant with myc7 (**ZmMYC2a**) was highly susceptible to insects, and the levels of benzoxazinoids and volatile terpenes, and the levels of their biosynthesis gene transcripts, were much lower.double mutant with myc7 (**ZmMYC2a**) was highly susceptible to insects, and the levels of benzoxazinoids and volatile terpenes, and the levels of their biosynthesis gene transcripts, were much lower.
