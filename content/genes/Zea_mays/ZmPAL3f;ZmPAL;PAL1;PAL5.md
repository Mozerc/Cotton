## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb185250]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmPAL3f;ZmPAL;PAL1;PAL5
- **Gene Name:** phenylalanine ammonia lyase5
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Three genes (**ZmPAL**1, **ZmPAL**2, and **ZmPAL**5) were strongly expressed in all three maize lines, in both nematode-infected and noninfected roots, between 2 and 16 d after inoculation.
   - The genes **ZmPAL**1, **ZmPAL**2, **ZmPAL**4, and **ZmPAL**5 were expressed in the roots of infected and noninfected maize at each sample time (0 to 16 DAI). **ZmPAL**3 was not detected in the roots and **ZmPAL**6 was found expressed in the leaves but not in the roots (data not shown).
   - These observations are consistent with at least one PAL gene playing a role in modulating host status of maize toward M. incognita and suggest a need for additional research to further elucidate this association.
