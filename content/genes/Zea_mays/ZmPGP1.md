## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[GRMZM2G315375]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmPGP1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome Version:** [B73 RefGen_v3]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Natural Variation and Domestication Selection of **ZmPGP1** Affects Plant Architecture and Yield-Related Traits in Maize.
   - **ZmPGP1**, involved in the polar auxin transport, has been shown to be associated with plant height, leaf angle, yield traits, and root development in maize.
   - **ZmPGP1** may be selected in the domestication and improvement process, and significant variants could be used to develop functional markers to improve plant architecture and ear traits in maize.
