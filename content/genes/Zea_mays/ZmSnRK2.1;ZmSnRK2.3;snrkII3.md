## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb023880]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmSnRK2.1;ZmSnRK2.3;snrkII3
- **Gene Name:** SnRK2 serine threonine protein kinase3
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmSnRK2.3** and ZmSnRK2.7, as a duplicated gene pair, do not respond to abiotic stress.
   - OsSAPK8 (orthologous to **ZmSnRK2.3** and ZmSnRK2.7) acts as a positive regulator when plants are subjected to cold, drought, and salt stress . Meanwhile, reported that miR395 was up-regulated under drought stress. The current study showed that miR395 could target and cut the mRNA of **ZmSnRK2.3**.
   - 11 ZmSnRK genes showed almost no expression changes under all analyzed stresses, such as ZmSnRK1.4, **ZmSnRK2.3**, and ZmSnRK3.13.
