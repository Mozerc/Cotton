## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb300570]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmKR2;kr2
- **Gene Name:** kauralexin reductase2
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Functional modification of these hydrocarbon scaffolds through cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) of the CYP701 (ZmCYP701A43) and CYP71 (ZmCYP71Z16, ZmCYP71Z18) families, along with a steroid 5Î±-reductase termed Kauralexin Reductase 2 (**ZmKR2**), then largely defines the structural diversity and bioactivity of KX and DX metabolites.
   - one known diterpenoid pathway gene, ZmKr2, was differentially expressed between WT and Zmksl4 under both well-watered and water-deficit conditions. None of the known GA-biosynthesis genes were significantly differentially expressed between WT and Zmksl4 under either water condition.
