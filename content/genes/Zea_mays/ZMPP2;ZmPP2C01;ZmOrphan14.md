## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb003000](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb003000)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZMPP2;ZmPP2C01;ZmOrphan14
- **Gene Name:** protein phosphatase homolog101
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The deduced amino acid sequence of **ZMPP2** contains the five PP2C signature domains, as does PDP. However, the expression pattern of **ZMPP2**, determined by reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction, was different from those of the maize pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α subunit and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.
   - The predicted subcellular location of **ZMPP2** is cytoplasmic, while the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, regulated by reversible phosphorylation, is mitochondrial. Thus, **ZMPP2** is a PP2C‐type protein phosphatase related to but distinct from PDP.
   - Expression of the **ZMPP2** mRNA in various maize organs was determined using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction.
