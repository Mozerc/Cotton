## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb398970](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb398970)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCOI6.1
- **Gene Name:** stress inducible protein coi6.1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmCOI6.1**, a novel, alternatively spliced maize gene, whose transcript level changes under abiotic stress.
   - Analysis of the **ZmCOI6.1** promoter sequence revealed several conserved stress-responsive cis-acting elements. Further characterization of expression showed that **ZmCOI6.1** was induced not only by cold, but also by drought and salinity as well as by the signaling molecules abscisic acid and salicylic acid, indicating that **ZmCOI6.1** is a stress-responsive gene.
   - **ZmCOI6.1** is alternatively spliced and yields two transcripts, the level of which change depending on the stress, indicating a possible mechanism of regulation at the splicing level. Constitutive expression of **ZmCOI6.1** in Arabidopsis yielded plants that were less tolerant to abiotic stress, providing evidence that **ZmCOI6.1** may be a negative regulator.
