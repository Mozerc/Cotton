## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb130310](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb130310)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmHKT1</u>&nbsp;<u>nc1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Na+ content1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmHKT1** was an important contributor to the phenotypic variations of seedling root traits in maize, these significant variants could use to develop functional markers to improve root traits.
   - We found that the maize salt tolerance gene **ZmHKT1** may be involved in root development.
   - The gene displayed high level of nucleotide diversity, especially in non-genic regions. A total of 19 variations in untranslated region of **ZmHKT1** were found to be associated with six seedling traits.
   - The genomic sequences of a salt tolerance gene **ZmHKT1** was resequenced in 349 maize inbred lines, and the association between nucleotide polymorphisms and seedling root traits was detected.
   - In maize, **ZmHKT1** has been associated with salt tolerance, but no studies have shown it to be associated with root development.
   - **ZmHKT1** is required for Na+ homeostasis and salt tolerance in maize.
