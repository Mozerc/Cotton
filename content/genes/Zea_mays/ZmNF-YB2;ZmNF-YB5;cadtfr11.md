## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb042490]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmNF-YB2;ZmNF-YB5;cadtfr11
- **Gene Name:** CCAAT-DR1-transcription factor 11
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Overexpression of **ZmNF-YB2** and AtNF-YBl in maize and Arabidopsis can improve the drought resistance of plants.
   - **ZmNF-YB2** were expressed at high levels in the roots, stems, leaves, internode, silks, and tassels.
   - Under water-limited conditions, transgenic maize plants with increased **ZmNF-YB2** expression show tolerance to drought based on the responses of a number of stress-related parameters, including chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature, reduced wilting, and maintenance of photosynthesis.
