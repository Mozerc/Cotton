## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb065670]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmNF-YB16;ZmNF-YB3;ca3p2
- **Gene Name:** CCAAT-HAP3-transcription factor 32
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmNF-YB3** responded to POD in the blue module, and ZmNF-YC12 and ZmNF-YC3 responded to SOD located in the blue module. It is thus speculated that these genes play important roles in drought and rewatering treatments.
   - **ZmNF-YB3**, except that the expression of ZmNF-YB11 was highest at 48 h under high temperature stress.
   - These results provide a molecular basis for drought-resistant breeding.
