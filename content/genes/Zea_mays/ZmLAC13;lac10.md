## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb166100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmLAC13;lac10
- **Gene Name:** laccase10
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Four candidate genes (Zm00001d048759, Zm00001d004689, Zm00001d004843, Zm00001d033527) were previously reported to correlate with heavy metal transport and tolerance. These findings will contribute to functional gene identification and molecular marker-assisted breeding for improving heavy metal tolerance in maize.
   - The gene model Zm00001d048759 belongs to the putative laccase family (**lac10**), which was associated with PER under T condition. Laccase is a kind of copper-containing glycoprotein oxidase and is involved lignin synthesis and resistance to stress in higher plants.
