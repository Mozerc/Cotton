## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb164740]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmMYB59;myb88
- **Gene Name:** MYB-transcription factor 88
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmMYB59** was localized in the nucleus. By analysing cis-acting elements of its promoter sequence, many elements of MYB binding domain responsive to hormones (particularly gibberellin, GA) were found.
   - **ZmMYB59** may play a negative regulatory role in seed germination in deep soil and the regulation is involved in GA signalling pathway.
   - **ZmMYB59** and AtMYB59 belong to R2R3-type MYB protein and contain a large number of Î±-helix and random curl.
