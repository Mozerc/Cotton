## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb405270](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb405270)
- **Gene Symbol:** nbs42
- **Gene Name:** nucleotide-binding site42
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Bulked-segregant analysis coupled with whole-genome sequencing revealed several quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 1, 6, 8, and 10. A set of 25 genes, including two coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) genes, were identified as candidate genes for a major-effect QTL on chromosome 10.
   - Based on the transcriptome analysis, one of the CC-NBS-LRR candidate genes was confirmed to be upregulated in L119A relative to Lx9801 independently of P. polysora inoculation. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses indicated that transcription factors, as well as genes involved in defense responses and metabolic processes, were dominantly enriched, with the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway most specifically activated.
   - Twenty-five candidate genes were identified in this region based on the B73 reference genome, including two coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) genes, Zm00001d023265 and Zm00001d023267. qRT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression of both Zm00001d023265 and Zm00001d023267 was higher in L119A than in Lx9801 independently of P. polysora inoculation.
