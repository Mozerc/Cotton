## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb005730]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZM-BG1H1;bgh1
- **Gene Name:** Zea Mays BIG GRAIN 1 HOMOLOG 1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZM-BG1H1** overexpression is associated with increased ear kernel row number and total ear kernel number and mass, but individual kernels trended slightly smaller and less dense.
   - The Zea Mays BIG GRAIN 1 HOMOLOG 1 (**ZM-BG1H1**) was ectopically expressed in maize. Elite commercial hybrid germplasm was yield tested in diverse field environment locations representing commercial models.
   - Overexpression of the **ZM-BG1H1** homolog does increase maize grain yield across a range of field environments, demonstrating that BG1 homologs may improve yield across multiple crops.
   - This indicates that **ZM-BG1H1** OE conferred yield advantages across a broad range of environments, test locations and stress levels.
   - Apart from the obvious conflict with the OS-BG1 study where seed size increased, the smaller size indicated that the **ZM-BG1H1** OE events hybrid yield trials did not benefit at planting from larger seeds than for controls.
