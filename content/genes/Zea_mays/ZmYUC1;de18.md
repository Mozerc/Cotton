## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb409250]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmYUC1;de18
- **Gene Name:** defective18
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - miR169o and ZmNF-YA13 act in concert to coordinate the expression of **ZmYUC1** that determines seed size and weight in maize kernels.
   - We demonstrate that ZmNF-YA13 regulates the expression of the auxin biosynthetic gene **ZmYUC1**, which modulates auxin levels in the early developing seeds and determines the number of endosperm cells, thereby governing maize seed size and ultimately yield.
   - ZmNF-YA13 activates the transcription of maize auxin synthesis gene **ZmYUC1**.
   - Except for **ZmYUC1**, the expression levels of other auxin synthesis genes were extremely low, suggestive of a key role of **ZmYUC1** in auxin synthesis at such an early stage of seed development.
   - Significant upregulation in **ZmYUC1** in NF-YA13 OE plants and downregulation in miR169o OE were verified by qPCR in 5 DAP kernels.
