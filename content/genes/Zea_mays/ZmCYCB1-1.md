## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001d012560]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCYCB1-1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-GRAMENE-4.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmCYCB1-1** overexpression significantly accelerated embryo growth and increased seed size.
   - **ZmCYCB1-1** was highly expressed in the plumule of embryos, and the cells of the plumule were smaller, denser, and more regularly arranged in **ZmCYCB1-1** overexpression plants.
   - Overexpression of **ZmCYCB1-1** in maize also resulted in an increased ear length and enhanced kernel weight by increasing kernel width.
   - **ZmCYCB1-1** regulates embryo growth and seed size, making it an ideal target for efforts aimed at maize yield improvement.
