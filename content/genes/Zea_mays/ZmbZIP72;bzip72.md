## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb332590]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmbZIP72;bzip72
- **Gene Name:** bZIP-transcription factor 72
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - we cloned **Zm**bzip72****, a bZIP transcription factor gene from maize, which had only one copy in the maize genome and harbored three introns. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of **Zm**bzip72**** revealed a highly conserved bZIP DNA-binding domain in its C-terminal region, and four conserved sequences distributed in N- or C-terminal region.
   - Subcellular localization analysis in onion epidermal cells indicated that **Zm**bzip72**** was a nuclear protein. Transactivation assay in yeast demonstrated that **Zm**bzip72**** functioned as a transcriptional activator and its N terminus (amino acids 23â€“63) was necessary for the transactivation activity.
   - Heterologous overexpression of **Zm**bzip72**** improved drought and partial salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants, as determined by physiological analyses of leaf water loss, electrolyte leakage, proline content, and survival rate under stress.
