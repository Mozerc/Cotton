## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[GRMZM2G449830]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmBRI1b
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome Version:** [B73 RefGen_v3]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The high expression levels of zmbri1a and zmbri1b, but not the other brl genes, suggest that the BRI1 receptors encoded by these two genes are of primary importance for regulating leaf growth.
   - Zmbri1a and Zmbri1b expression was high at the base of the leaf in the zones of active cell division and cell elongation, gradually declining as cells differentiate and mature.
