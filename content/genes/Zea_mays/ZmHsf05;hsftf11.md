## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb060670]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmHsf05;hsftf11
- **Gene Name:** HSF-transcription factor 11
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmHsf05**, a new heat shock transcription factor from Zea mays L. improves thermotolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana and rescues thermotolerance defects of the athsfa2 mutant.
   - **ZmHsf05** was expressed in many maize tissues and its expression level was increased by heat stress treatment. **ZmHsf05** rescued the reduced thermotolerance of the athsfa2 mutant in Arabidopsis seedlings. Arabidopsis seedlings of **ZmHsf05**-overexpressing increased both the basal and acquired thermotolerances.
   - The expression of Hsps was up-regulated in the **ZmHsf05**-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines after heat stress treatment. These results suggested that **ZmHsf05** plays an important role in both basal and acquired thermotolerance in plants.
