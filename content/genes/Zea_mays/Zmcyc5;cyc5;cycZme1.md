## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb332550]()
- **Gene Symbol:** Zmcyc5;cyc5;cycZme1
- **Gene Name:** cyclin5
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - Zmcyc1 and **Zm**cyc5**** were expressed in all studied tissues with the highest expression in leaves and lowest expression in roots.
   - Wounding, methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid significantly induced the expression of Zmcyc1 and **Zm**cyc5**** genes.
   - Zmcyc1 and **Zm**cyc5**** encoding PR proteins could also play defense roles in the maize defense systems against fungi.
