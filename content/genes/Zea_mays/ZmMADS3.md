## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb298680]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmMADS3
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The Maize MADS Box Gene **ZmMADS3** Affects Node Number and Spikelet Development and Is Co-Expressed withZmMADS1 during Flower Development, in Egg Cells, and Early Embryogenesis.
   - Transgenic maize plants ectopically expressing **ZmMADS3**are reduced in height due to a reduced number of nodes.
   - ZmMADS1 and **ZmMADS3** Are Expressed in ECs, Zygotes, and Somatic Embryo-Forming Cells As Well As in Stem Nodes during Vegetative Development.
   - Ectopic **ZmMADS3** Expression Affects Plant Height and Male Spikelet Development.
