## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb298680](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb298680)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmMADS3
- **Gene Name:** MADS3
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Addressing the question of whether MADS box genes are involved in the regulation of the fertilization process and early embryo development, we have isolated two novel MADS box cDNAs, ZmMADS1 and **ZmMADS3**, from cDNA libraries of maize (Zea mays) pollen and egg cells, respectively.
   - **ZmMADS3** is detectable only by more sensitive reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses, but is likewise expressed in embryogenic cultures. Both genes are not expressed in nonembryogenic suspension cultures and in isolated immature and mature zygotic embryos.
   - The Maize MADS Box Gene **ZmMADS3** Affects Node Number and Spikelet Development and Is Co-Expressed withZmMADS1 during Flower Development, in Egg Cells, and Early Embryogenesis.
   - Transgenic maize plants ectopically expressing **ZmMADS3**are reduced in height due to a reduced number of nodes.
   - ZmMADS1 and **ZmMADS3** Are Expressed in ECs, Zygotes, and Somatic Embryo-Forming Cells As Well As in Stem Nodes during Vegetative Development.
   - Ectopic **ZmMADS3** Expression Affects Plant Height and Male Spikelet Development.
