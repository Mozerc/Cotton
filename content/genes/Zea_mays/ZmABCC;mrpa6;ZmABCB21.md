## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb341220]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmABCC;mrpa6;ZmABCB21
- **Gene Name:** multidrug resistance associated protein6
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - These results strongly suggest that H2S can increase the content of thiol-containing compounds and ABCC gene expression, thus reducing the heavy metals inside the cytoplasm.
   - The expression of **ZmABCC** in the roots and leaves was significantly increased by H2S.
   - ABCC gene expression, than non-treated plants, leading to more Cr being stored in the vacuoles.
