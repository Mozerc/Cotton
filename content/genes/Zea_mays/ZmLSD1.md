## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb173250]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmLSD1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmLSD1** (zinc finger protein, negatively regulates the basal defense and cell death pathway) were repressed by drought and ZmNF-YA1 works as an activator of the expression of those two genes.
   - **ZmLSD1** gene by binding to their CCAAT regions in promoters contributed to the enhanced tolerance of abiotic stress in the ZmNF-YA1 OE maize plants.
   - **ZmLSD1** is suggested to interact with other members and play important roles in flowering regulation and stress response.
