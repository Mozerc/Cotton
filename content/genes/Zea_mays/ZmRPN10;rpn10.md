## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb398860]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmRPN10;rpn10
- **Gene Name:** regulatory particle non-ATPase 10
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The homologous **Zm**rpn10**** in maize has not been studied. In this study, the changing of leaf angle and gene expression in leaves in maize wild-type B73 and mutant **rpn10** under exogenous brassinosteroids (BRs) were investigated.
   - In this study, we identified a **Zm**rpn10**** mutant **rpn10** from an ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutant library of maize inbred line B73, which displays a relatively larger leaf angle. With B73 and **rpn10** as experimental materials, we discussed the regulation mechanism of **Zm**rpn10**** on maize leaf angle from field characteristics, cytological analysis, bioinformatics, expression pattern analysis, exogenous BR response and transcriptome analysis.
   - We can speculate that under exogenous BR treatment, **Zm**rpn10**** may regulate maize leaf angle changes through these differentially expressed.
