## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb094770]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCDPK38;cdpk33;CPK38
- **Gene Name:** calcium dependent protein kinase33
- **Genome Version:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **ZmCDPK38** protein contains four classical conserved domains of CDPK family member indicating its protein kinase characters. And the transcriptional analysis demonstrated that the expression of **ZmCDPK38** gene was induced in response to drought and salt stress, suggesting that it may play a role in the regulation of drought and salt tolerance.
   - **ZmCDPK38** protein contained four classical conserved domains of CDPK family member, including Ser/Thr protein kinase domains.
   - **ZmCDPK38** gene was expressed in a tissue-specific manner, which showed high expression level in maize leaves and less mRNA accumulation in stem, root, ear and tassel.
