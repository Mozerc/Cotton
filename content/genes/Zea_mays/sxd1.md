## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb237270]()
- **Gene Symbol:** Sxd1
- **Gene Name:** sucrose export defective1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - The Sucrose export defective1 (**Sxd1**) gene of maize was cloned and shown to encode a novel protein conserved between plants and cyanobacteria.
   - Disruption of chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling in **Sxd1** mutants likely has pleiotropic effects on the developing leaf, resulting in the sealing of BS-VP plasmodesmata and subsequent VP cell death.
