## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb163790]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCDKB1;CDKB1;cdc3
- **Gene Name:** cell division control protein homolog3
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - We studied maize CDKA2;1a and **CDKB1**;1, two of the main types of CDKs that control the cell cycle in plants. These kinases could be activated by the classical mechanism and by the association of CycD2;2a to a phosphorylated intermediate in its activation loop, a previously unproven mechanism for the activation of plant CDKs.
   - Unlike CDKA2;1a, **CDKB1**;1 did not require CAK for its activation, since it autophosphorylated in its activation loop.
   - The **CDKB1**;1/CycD2;2a complex autophosphorylates inâ€‰vitro in the T loop.
