## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb209670](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb209670)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmNRT2.1</u>&nbsp;<u>nrt2</u>
- **Gene Name:** nitrate transport2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmNRT2.1** and ZmNRT2.2, that have about 98% homology in their amino acid sequence. Both are inducible to NO3− in seedling roots, having been found transcripts of the former in the region of the root cortex while, for the latter, in the cortex, stele, and lateral primordia of the roots.
   - **NRT2**/NRT3 (NAR2)—play an important role in the high-affinity transport of NO3−.
   - **ZmNRT2.1** and ZmNRT2.2 are inducible to NO3− in seedling roots, having been found transcripts of the former in the region of the root cortex while, for the latter, in the cortex, stele, and lateral primordia of the roots.
   - Transcript abundances of putative high-affinity NRTs (predominantly **ZmNRT2.1** and ZmNRT2.2) were correlated with two distinct peaks in high-affinity root NO3- uptake capacity and also N availability.
   - When N supply was varied (N-inc or N-red), the commonality in change to **ZmNRT2.1** and ZmNRT2.2 transcript levels and associated change in NO3- flux capacity further supported this role.
