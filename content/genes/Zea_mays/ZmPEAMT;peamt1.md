## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb155940](https://www.maizegdb.org/gene_center/gene/Zm00001eb155940)
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmPEAMT;peamt1
- **Gene Name:** phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0](https://www.maizegdb.org/genome/assembly/Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0)
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (**ZmPEAMT**), a key enzyme for betaine synthesis, is reported to be regulated by its upstream promoter. In the present investigation, by using the transgenic approach, a 1048 bp long promoter region of **ZmPEAMT** gene from Zea mays was cloned and functionally characterized in tobacco.
   - The T1 generation transgenic tobacco plants possessing a single copy of the transgene were assessed for GUS expression under control and stressful regimes including salt, drought, cold and oxidative stress for determining the optimal length of the **ZmPEAMT** promoter for achieving effective gene expression.
   - **ZmPEAMT** gene promoter, as a stress-inducible promoter, may be used to biological engineering for solving the problem caused by abiotic stress in different plants that might provide staple food crops.
   - **ZmPEAMT** gene involved in betaine synthesis.
