## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb404750]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmD53;D53
- **Gene Name:** dwarf ortholog53
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - All three of these, **D53**, D14, and D3, are named for the DWARF vegetative phenotype that results from a deficiency in SL signaling.
   - The way **D53** exerts this control is by aiding sequestration of transcription factors into inactive complexes.
   - **D53** mutants would lack elongated glumes and cupules, as well as suppress the ear phenotypes of ccd8 mutants by releasing TGA1 from its complexed form.
