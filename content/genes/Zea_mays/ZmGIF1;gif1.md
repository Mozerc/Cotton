## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb056300]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmGIF1;gif1
- **Gene Name:** growth-regulating-factor-interacting factor1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - **Zm**gif1****, a cell wall invertase from maize, can be used to breed new cultivars with higher grain yields.
   - **Zm**gif1****, a cell wall invertase encoded by Mn1 and abundantly expressed in endosperm, works as the major determinant for sink strength in developing seeds.
   - **Zm**gif1**** can be used as a selection marker, and its expression can be combined between different parental cultivars to increase the invertase activity, and as a result, increase the grain yield of their hybrid progenies.
