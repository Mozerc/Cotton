## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Zm00001eb001260]()
- **Gene Symbol:** ZmCDKA2;CDKA1;cdc2
- **Gene Name:** cell division control protein homolog2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Description:
   - We studied maize CDKA2;1a and CDKB1;1, two of the main types of CDKs that control the cell cycle in plants. These kinases could be activated by the classical mechanism and by the association of CycD2;2a to a phosphorylated intermediate in its activation loop, a previously unproven mechanism for the activation of plant CDKs.
   - As a positive control of phosphatase activity and antibody recognition, CDKA2;1a phosphorylated at T161 in complex with CycD2;2a was included in treatments.
   - These experiments show that CDKA2;1a can be activated by at least two mechanisms, the classic one in which CDKA2;1a associates with CycD2;2a, provoking a partial activation; then, CDK in the complex can be efficiently phosphorylated by Cak1p, causing total activation of CDK.
