## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc11g010660]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlSGT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Solyc11g010660, a homolog of SGT1 (suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1), was predicted as a target of SlymiR482e-3p and termed as **SlSGT1**.
   - **SlSGT1** was dramatically induced during Fol infection in the susceptible cultivar Moneymaker, meanwhile, the basal level of **SlSGT1** was elevated in the SlylmiR482e-3p-KO mutant possibly resulting in the resistance to Fol.
   - Considering all of the above results, we concluded that SlymiR482e-3p regulates **SlSGT1** expression by chopping the intact mRNA.
