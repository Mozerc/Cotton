## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc11g010660]()
- **Gene Symbol:** SlSGT1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [tomato genome sequence SL4.0]()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Description:
   - Solyc11g010660, a homolog of SGT1 (suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1), was predicted as a target of SlymiR482e-3p and termed as **SlSGT1**.
   - **SlSGT1** was dramatically induced during Fol infection in the susceptible cultivar Moneymaker, meanwhile, the basal level of **SlSGT1** was elevated in the SlylmiR482e-3p-KO mutant possibly resulting in the resistance to Fol.
