## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc09g015380]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlPYL9</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - PYL9 is involved in the regulation of ABA signaling during tomato fruit ripening.
   - We reveal the role of **SlPYL9**, a tomato pyrabactin resistance (PYR)/pyrobactin resistance-like (PYL)/regulatory component of ABA receptors (RCAR) protein, as a positive regulator of ABA signaling and fruit ripening.
   - **SlPYL9**-OE/RNAi plants showed a typical ABA hyper-/hypo-sensitive phenotype in terms of seed germination, primary root growth, and response to drought.
   - Fruit ripening was significantly accelerated in **SlPYL9**-OE by 5–7 d as a result of increased endogenous ABA accumulation and advanced release of ethylene compared with the wild-type.
   - In the **SlPYL9**-RNAi lines, fruit ripening was delayed, mesocarp thickness was enhanced, and the petals did not abscise as timely as the WT, resulting in conical / oblong and gourd-shaped fruit. These results suggest that **SlPYL9** is involved in ABA signaling, thereby playing a role in the regulation of flower abscission and fruit ripening in tomato.
