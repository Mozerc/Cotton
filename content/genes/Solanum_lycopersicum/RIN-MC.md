## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc05g012020]()
- **Gene Symbol:** RIN-MC
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [tomato genome sequence SL4.0]()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Description:
   - The **RIN-MC** Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes.
   - The **RIN-MC** fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors.
   - These results indicated that tomato **RIN-MC** fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the rin mutant phenotype.
