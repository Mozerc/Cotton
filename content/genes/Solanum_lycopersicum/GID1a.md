## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc01g098390]()
- **Gene Symbol:** GID1a
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Unique Role of **GID1a** in the Regulation of Plant Growth in Response to High GA Levels.
   - **GID1a** had the strongest effect on germination, stem elongation, and leaflet growth and color.
   - **GID1a** has the most significant contribution to GA responses, which has been attributed to its high expression level.
   - They showed phenotypic instability, the high redundancy was lost, and **GID1a** exhibited dwarfism that was strongly exacerbated by the loss of another GID1b receptor gene.
