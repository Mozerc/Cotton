## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlIMP3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Control of fruit softening and Ascorbic acid accumulation by manipulation of **SlIMP3** in tomato.
   - **SlIMP3** demonstrated high affinity with the L-Gal 1-P and D-Ins 3-P, and acted as a bifunctional enzyme in the biosynthesis of AsA and myoinositol.
   - Overexpression of **SlIMP3** not only improved AsA and myoinositol content, but also increased cell wall thickness, improved fruit firmness, delayed fruit softening, decreased water loss, and extended shelf-life.
   - The results support a critical role for **SlIMP3** in AsA biosynthesis and cell wall biogenesis, and provide a new method of delaying tomato fruit softening, and insight into the link between AsA and cell wall metabolism.
