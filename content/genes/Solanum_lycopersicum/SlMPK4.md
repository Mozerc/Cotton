## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[]()
- **Gene Symbol:** SlMPK4
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Description:
   - **SlMPK4** is preferentially and highly expressed in tomato stamens and its mRNA levels increase during early flower development, peaking at the mature pollen stage.
   - Suppression of **SlMPK4** affects the transcript level of genes related to cell wall formation and modification, cell signal transduction, and metabolic and biosynthetic processes.
   - **SlMPK4** plays a critical role in regulating pollen development and fruit development in tomato plants.
