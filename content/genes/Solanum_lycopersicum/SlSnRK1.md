## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc02g067030]()
- **Gene Symbol:** SlSnRK1
- **Gene Name:** SNF1-related kinase 1
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The SNF1-related kinase 1 (SnRK1) proteins are important metabolic sensors. ABI1 and PP2CA phosphatases regulate SnRK1s in response to ABA and energy signals and interact with diverse stress conditions to promote a proper energy balance.
   - SnRK1 interacted with ABI5 and suppressed the transcription of ABI5, thereby affecting ABA signaling and the regulation of germination.
   - We found that MAPK11 interacts with and phosphorylates SnRK1 in vivo, thereby potentially inhibiting its activation.
   - Our results demonstrate that ABA signaling in tomato is affected by a mechanism that depends on MAPK11 phosphorylating SnRKs, and this ultimately influences seed germination.
