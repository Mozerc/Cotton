## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[ Solyc12g055990.1.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** SlRCAR11
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome Version:** [tomato genome sequence SL4.0]()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Description:
   - Co-silencing of ABA receptors (SlRCAR) reveals interactions between ABA and ethylene signaling during tomato fruit ripening.
   - The four genes of SlRCAR9, SlRCAR12, **SlRCAR11** and SlRCAR13 were silenced, which effectively inhibited the ABA signal related to tomato fruit ripening, and also inhibited the expression levels of ACS2 and ACS4, the key genes of ethylene synthesis, resulting in a significant weakening of tomato ethylene synthesis ability. And significantly delayed tomato fruit ripening.
   - Suppression of SlRCAR9, **SlRCAR11**, SlRCAR12, and SlRCAR13 alters fruit ripening time and texture in tomato.
