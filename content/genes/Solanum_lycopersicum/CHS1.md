## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc09g091510]()
- **Gene Symbol:** CHS1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The development of colourless peels in YB-CR-R fruit is mainly caused by the downregulation of genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis, especially **CHS1** and CHS2, rather than by the downregulation of MYB12.
   - Our data suggest that these complexes are involved in the transcriptional regulation and H3K27me3 marking of the **CHS1** locus. 
   - Suppressing the expression of particular NF-YB genes increased the levels of H3K27me3 at the **CHS1** locus and significantly suppressed the expression of **CHS1** during tomato fruit ripening, which led to the development of pink-coloured fruit with colourless peels.
