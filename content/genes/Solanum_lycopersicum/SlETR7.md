## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc05g055070]()
- **Gene Symbol:** SlETR7
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We observed that expression of the other SlETRs is upregulated in fruit of **SlETR7** KO mutants, which may explain the absence of obvious ripening phenotypes. Globally, these results show that **SlETR7** is a functional ethylene receptor. 
   - Roles of **SlETR7**, a newly discovered ethylene receptor, in tomato plant and fruit development.
   - We also showed that **SlETR7** specifically binds ethylene. Overexpression (OE) of **SlETR7** resulted in earlier flowering, shorter plants, and smaller fruit than wild type.
   - Knock-out (KO) mutants of **SlETR7** produced more ethylene at breaker (Br) and Br + 2 days stages compared to wild type (WT), but there were no other obvious changes in the plant and fruit in these mutant lines. We observed that expression of the other SlETRs is upregulated in fruit of **SlETR7** KO mutants, which may explain the absence of obvious ripening phenotypes.
   - These results show that **SlETR7** is a functional ethylene receptor.
