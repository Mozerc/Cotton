## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Solyc03g118770]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlLAM1</u>
- **Gene Name:** shoot apical meristem1
- **Genome:** [Tomato Genome version SL4.0](https://solgenomics.net/organism/solanum_lycopersicum/genome)
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Obtained and analyzed mutants of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) family gene **SlLAM1** from tomato, whose orthologs in tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris) and other species are indispensable for blade expansion.
   - **SlLAM1** mutants cause a delay of leaflet initiation and slightly alter the arrangement of first-order leaflets, whereas the overall leaflet number is comparable to that of wild-type leaves.
   - **SlLAM1** is also required for floral organ growth and affects the fertility of gametophytes.
   - We show that **SlLAM1** is also required for floral organ growth and affects the fertility of gametophytes. Our data suggest that **SlLAM1** promotes blade expansion in multiple leaf types, and leaflet initiation can be largely uncoupled from blade expansion during compound leaf morphogenesis.
   - **SlLAM1** promotes blade expansion in multiple leaf types, and leaflet initiation can be largely uncoupled from blade expansion during compound leaf morphogenesis.
   - The loss-of-function mutant of **SlLAM1** displayed fewer and much smaller secondary leaflets, and also had defects in the outgrowth of the mediolateral axis of leaves and flowers, indicating that **SlLAM1** is involved in secondary leaflet initiation in the Solanaceae in addition to the conserved function in promoting lateral organ expansion.
