## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZjSEP3</u>
- **Gene Name:** SEPALLATA3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Ziziphus jujuba*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZjSEP3** modulates flowering time by regulating the LHY promoter.
   - The ectopic regulatory pathway of **ZjSEP3**-AtLHY was further supported by the ability of 35S::AtLHY to rescue the early-flowering phenotype in **ZjSEP3** transgenic plants.
   - In **ZjSEP3** transgenic plants, total chlorophyll content and the expression of genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis increased during vegetative stages, which should contribute to its early flowering and relate to the regulatory of AtLHY.
   - Overall, **ZjSEP3**-AtLHY pathway represents a novel regulatory mechanism that is involved in the regulation of flowering time.
