## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zj.jz013123003]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZjACO3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Ziziphus jujuba*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A natural mutation in the promoter of the aconitase gene **ZjACO3** influences fruit citric acid content in jujube.
   - discovered an E-box mutation in the **ZjACO3** promoter (−484A > G| CAAGTG in sour jujube mutated to CAGGTG in cultivated jujube) that was strongly correlated with fruit citrate content| ‘A’ represented a high-citrate genotype and ‘G’ represented a low-citrate genotype.
   - Elucidating the mechanism by which **ZjACO3** regulates fruit acidity would be useful to control jujube fruit sweetness and acidity during breeding.
