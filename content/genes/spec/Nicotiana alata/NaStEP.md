## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NaStEP</u>
- **Gene Name:** Stigma Expressed Protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana alata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here the isolation and characterization of a stigma-specific protein from N. alata, **NaStEP** (N. alataStigma Expressed Protein), that is homologous to Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitors, are reported.
   - Activity gel assays showed that **NaStEP** is not a functional serine proteinase inhibitor.
   - **NaStEP** contains the vacuolar targeting sequence NPIVL, and immunocytochemistry experiments showed vacuolar localization in unpollinated stigmas.
   - The transfer of **NaStEP** to the stigmatic exudate was accompanied by perforation of the stigmatic cell wall, which appeared to release the vacuolar contents to the apoplastic space.
   - The increase in **NaStEP** synthesis after pollination and its presence in the stigmatic exudates suggest that this protein may play a role in the early pollenâ€“stigma interactions that regulate pollen tube growth in Nicotiana.
