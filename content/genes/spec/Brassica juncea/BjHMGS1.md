## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BjHMGS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica juncea*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - HMGS assays confirmed that Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant **BjHMGS1** shows HMGS activity that is inhibited by F244, a specific inhibitor of HMGS. 
   - Expression of Brassica juncea 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase (**BjHMGS1**) is developmentally regulated and stress-responsive.
   - Isolated a Brassica juncea cDNA encoding HMGS, **BjHMGS1**, for use as a hybridization probe in Northern blot analyses. BjHMGS is expressed in all plant organs and shows developmental regulation in flower, seed and seedling, with highest expression in early development.
