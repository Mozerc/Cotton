## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaWRKY1</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY transcription factor1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Capsicum annuum WRKY protein **CaWRKY1** is a negative regulator of pathogen defense.
   - **CaWRKY1** was found to be rapidly induced in C. annuum (chili pepper) leaves by incompatible and compatible pathogen inoculations, but the complexity of the network of the WRKY family prevented the function of **CaWRKY1** in defense from being elucidated.
   - Virus-induced gene silencing of **CaWRKY1** in chili pepper leaves resulted in decreased growth of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria race 1. **CaWRKY1**-overexpressing transgenic plants showed accelerated hypersensitive cell death in response to infection with tobacco mosaic virus and Pseudomonas syringe pv.
   - This work suggests that the newly characterized **CaWRKY1**, which is strongly induced by pathogen infections and the signal molecule SA, acts as a regulator to turn off systemic acquired resistance once the pathogen challenge has diminished and to prevent spurious activation of defense responses at suboptimal concentrations of SA.
