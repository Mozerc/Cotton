## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaPMEI1</u>
- **Gene Name:** pectin methlyesterase inhibitor protein 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Pepper pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein **CaPMEI1** is required for antifungal activity, basal disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance.
   - Here, we isolated and functionally characterized the pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) gene **CaPMEI1**, which encodes a pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein (PMEI), in pepper leaves infected by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv).
   - **CaPMEI1** transcripts are localized in the xylem of vascular bundles in leaf tissues, and pathogens and abiotic stresses can induce differential expression of this gene.
   - Purified recombinant **CaPMEI1** protein not only inhibits PME, but also exhibits antifungal activity against some plant pathogenic fungi. Virus-induced gene silencing of **CaPMEI1** in pepper confers enhanced susceptibility to Xcv, accompanied by suppressed expression of some defense-related genes.
   - Together, these results suggest that **CaPMEI1**, an antifungal protein, may be involved in basal disease resistance, as well as in drought and oxidative stress tolerance in plants.
