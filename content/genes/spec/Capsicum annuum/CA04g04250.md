## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [CA04g04250]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaLecRK-S.5</u>
- **Gene Name:** lectin receptor kinase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CaLecRK-S.5** , a pepper L-type lectin receptor kinase gene, confers broad-spectrum resistance by activating priming.
   - **CaLecRK-S.5** -silenced plants showed reduced hypersensitive response, reactive oxygen species burst, secondary metabolite production, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, and defense-related gene expression in response to Tobacco mosaic virus pathotype P 0 (TMV-P 0 ) infection.
   - Î²-aminobutyric acid treatment and a systemic acquired resistance assay revealed that **CaLecRK-S.5** is involved in priming of plant immunity.
   - RNA sequencing analysis indicated that **CaLecRK-S.5** positively regulates plant immunity at the transcriptional level. Altogether, these results suggest that **CaLecRK-S.5** -mediated broad-spectrum resistance is associated with the regulation of priming.
