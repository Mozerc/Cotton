## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaCAF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** CCR4-associated factor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Capsicum annuum CCR4-associated factor **CaCAF1** is necessary for plant development and defence response.
   - Overexpression of **CaCAF1** in tomato resulted in significant growth enhancement, with increasing leaf thickness, and enlarged cell size by more than twofold when compared with the control plants.
   - In addition to developmental changes, overexpression of **CaCAF1** in tomato plants resulted in enhanced resistance against the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans.
   - **CaCAF1**-transgenic tomato plants revealed that multiple genes were constitutively upregulated, including genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis, defence reactions and cell-wall organogenesis.
   - VIGS of **CaCAF1** in pepper plants caused significant growth retardation and enhanced susceptibility to the pepper bacterial spot pathogen Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria. Our results suggest roles for plant CAF1 in normal growth and development, as well as in defence against pathogens.
