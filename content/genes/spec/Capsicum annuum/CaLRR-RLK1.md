## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaLRR-RLK1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CaLRR-RLK1**, a novel RD receptor-like kinase from Capsicum annuum and transcriptionally activated by CaHDZ27, act as positive regulator in Ralstonia solanacearum resistance.
   - The silencing of **CaLRR-RLK1** led to enhanced susceptibility of pepper plants to RSI, accompanied by down-regulation of immunity-related genes including CaACO1, CaHIR1, CaPR4 and CaPO2.
   - It was found that CaHDZ27, a positive regulator in pepper response to RSI in our previous study, transcriptionally activated **CaLRR-RLK1** by direct targeting its promoter probably in a CAATTATTG dependent manner.
   - The study revealed that **CaLRR-RLK1** confers pepper resistance to R. solanacearum as the direct targeting of CaHDZ27.
