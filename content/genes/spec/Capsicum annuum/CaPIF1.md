## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaPIF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Pathogen-Induced Factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A plant EPF-type zinc-finger protein, **CaPIF1**, involved in defence against pathogens.
   - **CaPIF1** expression was rapidly and specifically induced when pepper plants were challenged with bacterial pathogens to which they are resistant.
   - **CaPIF1** expression was also strongly induced in pepper leaves by the exogenous application of ethephon, an ethylene-releasing compound, and salicylic acid, whereas methyl jasmonate had only moderate effects.
   - **CaPIF1** orthologue in Nicotiana benthamiana enhanced susceptibility to the same host or non-host bacterial pathogens. These observations provide evidence that an EPF-type Cys2/His2 zinc-finger protein plays a crucial role in the activation of the pathogen defence response in plants.
