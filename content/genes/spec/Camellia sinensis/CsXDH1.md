## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsXDH1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CsXDH1** gene promotes caffeine catabolism induced by continuous strong light in tea plant.
   - The expression of **CsXDH1** gene was up-regulated with increasing light intensity, which was negatively correlated with the trend of caffeine and theobromine in response to light intensity.
   - **CsXDH1** gene overexpression induced by strong light promotes the degradation of caffeine, theobromine, and xanthine in tea plant.
   - **CsXDH1** may be a coordinating factor between light intensity adaptation and caffeine catabolism.
