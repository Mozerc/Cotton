## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsSWEET17</u>
- **Gene Name:** Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter 17
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - CsSWEET1a and **CsSWEET17** Mediate Growth and Freezing Tolerance by Promoting Sugar Transport across the Plasma Membrane.
   - The extra C-terminal of **CsSWEET17**, which is not found in the tonoplast fructose transporter AtSWEET17, did not affect its plasma membrane localization but promoted its sugar transport activities.
   - The overexpression (OE) of CsSWEET1a and **CsSWEET17** genes resulted in an increased sugar uptake in Arabidopsis, affecting plant germination and growth.
   - The leaf and seed sizes of the **CsSWEET17**-OE lines were significantly larger than those of the wild type. Moreover, the OE of CsSWEET1a and **CsSWEET17** significantly reduced the relative electrolyte leakage levels under freezing stress.
   - We showed that CsSWEET1a and **CsSWEET17** form homo-/heterodimers in the plasma membrane and mediate the partitioning of sugars between the cytoplasm and the apoplast, thereby regulating plant growth and freezing tolerance.
