## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [CSS004414]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsWRKY40</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY transcription factor 40
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcription factor **CsWRKY40** regulates L-theanine hydrolysis by activating the CsPDX2.1 promoter in tea leaves during withering.
   - The **CsWRKY40** protein was located in the nucleoplasm, whereas CsPDX2.1 was found in both the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm.
   - This suggests that the response of the transcription factor **CsWRKY40** may be related to the water-induced ABA signal.
   - Analysis of withering, water-retention, and water-loss treatments confirmed that water loss from tea leaves was the critical factor that affected ABA and L-theanine contents by activating the expression of **CsWRKY40** and CsPDX2.1. Our results provide a new insight into the regulatory mechanism of L-theanine hydrolysis metabolism.
