## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SmCPS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** copalyl diphosphate synthase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Salvia miltiorrhiza*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The ethylene response factor SmERF6 co-regulates the transcription of **SmCPS1** and SmKSL1 and is involved in tanshinone biosynthesis in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy roots.
   - This gene was subsequently found to function directly in transcriptional activation of both **SmCPS1** and SmKSL1, which are the key genes in the final steps of tanshinone biosynthesis, and promoted tanshinone accumulation.
   - **SmCPS1** and SmKSL1 were reported to be key genes in the final steps of the tanshinone biosynthesis pathway.
   - These findings elucidated how SmERF6 directly co-regulates the transcription of **SmCPS1** and SmKSL1 and modulates tanshinone synthesis to accelerate the metabolic flux of tanshinone accumulation in S. miltiorrhiza.
