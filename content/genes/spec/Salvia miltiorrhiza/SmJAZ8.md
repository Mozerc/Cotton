## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SmJAZ8</u>
- **Gene Name:** jasmonate ZIM-domain protein 8
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Salvia miltiorrhiza*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SmJAZ8** acts as a core repressor regulating JA-induced biosynthesis of salvianolic acids and tanshinones in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy roots.
   - Overexpression or RNAi of **SmJAZ8** deregulated or up-regulated the yields of salvianolic acids and tanshinones in the MeJA-induced transgenic hairy roots, respectively, and transcription factors and biosynthetic pathway genes showed an expression pattern that mirrored the production of the compounds.
   - Genetic transformation of **SmJAZ8** altered the expression of other SmJAZ genes, suggesting evidence of crosstalk occurring in JAZ-regulated secondary metabolism. Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis revealed a primaryâ€“secondary metabolism balance regulated by **SmJAZ8**.
   - Altogether, we propose a novel role for **SmJAZ8** as a negative feedback loop controller in the JA-induced biosynthesis of salvianolic acids and tanshinones.
