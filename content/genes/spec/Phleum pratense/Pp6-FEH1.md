## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Pp6-FEH1</u>
- **Gene Name:** fructan exohydrolase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Phleum pratense*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Pp6-FEH1** encodes an enzyme for degradation of highly polymerized levan and is transcriptionally induced by defoliation in timothy.
   - A cDNA from timothy was cloned, named **Pp6-FEH1**, that showed similarity to wheat fructan 6-exohydrolase (6-FEH). The recombinant enzyme expressed in Pichia pastoris completely degraded fructans that were composed mainly of β(2,6)-linked and linear fructans (levan) with a high degree of polymerization (DP) in the crown tissues of timothy.
   - **Pp6-FEH1** had significant activity against β(2,1)-linked fructans, but considerably less than against β(2,6)-linked fructans.
   - These results suggest that **Pp6-FEH1** plays a role in the degradation of fructans and the mobilization of carbon sources for regrowth after defoliation in timothy.
