## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaPIMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cicer arietinum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - PROTEIN L-ISOASPARTYL METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (**CaPIMT1**) from chickpea mitigates oxidative stress-induced growth inhibition of Escherichia coli.
   - We demonstrate that the transcript of **CaPIMT1** is distributed across the organs with maximum levels in seed and is also enhanced under various environmental stress conditions. 
   - The activity is found to be elevated towards high temperature and pH conditions. Escherichia coli expressing **CaPIMT1** show greater tolerance to oxidative stress than E. coli without **CaPIMT1**.
   - Taken together, our results suggest that PIMT from chickpea shows a distinct pattern of expression and may have a specific role in stress adaptation apart from seed.
