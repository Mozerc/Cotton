## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DkNAC9</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Diospyros kaki*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - High CO2/hypoxia-induced softening of persimmon fruit is modulated by DkERF8/16 and **DkNAC9** complexes.
   - EMSAs indicated that **DkNAC9** retarded the biotin-labeled probe and that the cold competitor probe (without biotin labeling) could reduce the band intensity.
   - Based on these findings, we conclude that **DkNAC9** is a direct transcriptional activator of DkEGase1 that can co-operate with DkERF8/16 to enhance fruit post-deastringency softening.
   - Involvement of high CO2/hypoxia-responsive **DkNAC9** in regulating post-deastringency softening.
