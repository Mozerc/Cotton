## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DkBZR2</u>
- **Gene Name:** BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Diospyros kaki*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcription factors DkBZR1/**DkBZR2** regulate cell wall degradation genes and ethylene biosynthesis genes during persimmon fruit ripening.
   - Among the four BZR genes, DkBZR1/**DkBZR2** were expressed in persimmon fruit| DkBZR1 protein amount decreased and dephosphorylated **DkBZR2** gradually accumulated during the storage period.
   - DkBZR1/**DkBZR2** proteins were localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and accumulated in the nucleus after 24-epibrassinolide treatment.
   - Effect of DkBZR1/2 on promoters of cell wall-modifying and ethylene biosynthesis genes.
   - Our findings indicate that DkBZR1 and **DkBZR2** serve as repressors and activators of persimmon fruit ripening, respectively.
