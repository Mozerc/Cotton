## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DkMyb2</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB transcription factor2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Diospyros kaki*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DkMyb2** wound-induced transcription factor of persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.), contributes to proanthocyanidin regulation.
   - **DkMyb2**, which was placed in a subclade including a PA regulator of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), TRANSPARENT TESTA2 (TT2), and was co-induced with PA pathway genes after wound stress.
   - Ectopic **DkMyb2** overexpression caused significant up-regulation of PA pathway genes in transgenic persimmon calluses and significant accumulation of PA, and increased mean degree of polymerization of PAs in transgenic kiwifruit calluses.
   - We also discuss subfunctionalization of two PA regulators in persimmon, **DkMyb2** and DkMyb4, as well as PA regulators in other plant species from the viewpoint of their ability to bind to cis-motifs and their functions in transcriptional activation.
