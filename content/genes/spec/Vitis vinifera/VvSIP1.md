## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvSIP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** small basic intrinsic protein 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The grape aquaporin **VvSIP1** transports water across the ER membrane.
   - **VvSIP1** was expressed in leaves and berries from field-grown vines, and in leaves and stems from in vitro plantlets, but not in roots.
   - When expressed in tobacco mesophyll cells and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fluorescent-tagged **VvSIP1** was localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Stopped-flow spectroscopy showed that **VvSIP1**-enriched ER membrane vesicles from yeast exhibited higher water permeability and lower activation energy for water transport than control vesicles, indicating the involvement of protein-mediated water diffusion.
   - To provide further insights into gene function, the expression of **VvSIP1** in mature grapes was studied when vines were cultivated in different field conditions, but its transcript levels did not increase significantly in water-stressed plants and western-exposed berries. However, the expression of the aquaporin genes **VvSIP1**, VvPIP2|2, and VvTIP1|1 was up-regulated by heat in cultured cells.
