## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_19s0093g00550]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvNCED1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - At this point in the culture, our results suggest that of those genes involved in ABA accumulation, one (**VvNCED1**) was repressed, while another (VvBG2) was activated. Similarly, of those genes related to a reduction in ABA levels, one (VvUGT) was repressed while another (VvHyd2) was activated. 
   - The relative expression level of the **VvNCED1** gene in embryogenic aggregates cultured under the same conditions and treated with exogenous ABA revealed the significant downregulation of this gene.
   - The effect of exogenous ABA on **VvNCED1** gene expression was also tested as a contribution to the study of the regulation of ABA biosynthesis during the maturation of grapevine somatic embryos.
   - In addition, the treatment of somatic embryos with exogenous ABA suggested the feedback-based control of the expression of the **VvNCED1** gene by ABA during the maturation of grapevine somatic embryos.
