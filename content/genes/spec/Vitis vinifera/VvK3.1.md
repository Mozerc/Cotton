- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of the grapevine Shaker K+ channel **VvK3.1** supports its function in massive potassium fluxes necessary for berry potassium loading and pulvinus-actuated leaf movements.
   - Report functional characterization by electrophysiology of a new grapevine Shaker-type K+ channel, **VvK3.1**. The analysis of **VvK3.1** expression patterns was performed by qPCR and in situ hybridization.
   - **VvK3.1** belongs to the AKT2 channel phylogenetic branch and is a weakly rectifying channel, mediating both inward and outward K+ currents. We showed that **VvK3.1** is highly expressed in the phloem and in a unique structure located at the two ends of the petiole, identified as a pulvinus.
   - From the onset of fruit ripening, all data support the role of the **VvK3.1** channel in the massive K+ fluxes from the phloem cell cytosol to the berry apoplast during berry K+ loading. Moreover, the high amount of **VvK3.1** transcripts detected in the pulvinus strongly suggests a role for this Shaker in the swelling and shrinking of motor cells involved in paraheliotropic leaf movements.
