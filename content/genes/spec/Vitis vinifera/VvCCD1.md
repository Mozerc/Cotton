## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvCCD1</u>
- **Gene Name:** carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A Carotenoid Cleavage Dioxygenase from Vitis vinifera L.: functional characterization and expression during grape berry development in relation to C13-norisoprenoid accumulation.
   - Recombinant expression of **VvCCD1** confirmed that the gene encoded a functional CCD. Experimental evidence was obtained that **VvCCD1** cleaves zeaxanthin symmetrically yielding 3-hydroxy-β-ionone, a C13-norisoprenoidic compound, and a C14-dialdehyde. 
   - **VvCCD1** is induced at the early stages of the grape berry development.
   - These results showed that recombinant **VvCCD1** catalyses the symmetrical cleavage of zeaxanthin to generate 3-hydroxy-β-ionone and 4,9-dimethyldodeca-2,4,6,8,10-pentaene-1,12-dialdehyde.
