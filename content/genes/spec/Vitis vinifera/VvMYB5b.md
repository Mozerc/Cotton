## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvMYB5b</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB transcription factor5
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A single amino acid change within the R2 domain of the **VvMYB5b** transcription factor modulates affinity for protein partners and target promoters selectivity.
   - In this work, we describe the effects of a single amino acid substitution (R69L) located in the R2 domain of **VvMYB5b** and predicted to affect the formation of a salt bridge within the protein.
   - Flowers from 35S::**VvMYB5b**L transgenic plants showed a distinct phenotype in comparison with 35S::**VvMYB5b**R and the control plants. Finally, significant differences in transcript abundance of flavonoid metabolism genes were observed along with variations in pigments accumulation.
   - Our findings indicate that **VvMYB5b**L is still able to bind DNA but the structural consequences linked to the mutation affect the capacity of the protein to activate the transcription of some flavonoid genes by modifying the interaction with its co-partner(s).
