## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_06s0004g00570]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvMYB5b</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic grapevine plants with altered expression of VvMYB5a, **VvMYB5b**, and VvWRKY26 show phenotypic aberrations which strongly support a role for the MBWW complex in controlling different aspects of grape plant development and the accumulation of flavonoids.
   - VvMYB5a and **VvMYB5b** are able to replace the function of PhPH4 in the control of vacuolar hyper-acidification.
   - Transcriptomic analyses define roles for VvMYB5a, **VvMYB5b**, and VvWRKY26 in phenylpropanoid metabolism, vacuolar acidification, cell type identity, and membrane transport.
   - These results indicated that VvMYB5a and **VvMYB5b** are functionally distinct from the anthocyanin synthesis regulator VvMYBA1, and that both proteins are functionally interchangeable with the petunia homologue PH4.
