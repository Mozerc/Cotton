## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_07s0005g01450]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvibZIPC22</u>
- **Gene Name:** Pinot Noir basic region/leucine zipper motif C22 protein
- **Genome:** [12Xv1 assembly of the Pinot Noir genome(http://genomes.cribi.unipd.it/DATA/V1)]()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The grapevine **VvibZIPC22** transcription factor is involved in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis.
   - Identified **VvibZIPC22**, a member of clade C of the grapevine bZIP family, in a quantitative trait locus (QTL) specifically associated with kaemperol content in mature berries.
   - The overexpression of **VvibZIPC22** in tobacco caused a significant increase in several flavonoids in the flower, via induction of general and specific genes of the pathway.
   - **VvibZIPC22** was able to activate the promoters of specific genes of the flavonoid pathway, alone or together with other factors, as revealed by transient reporter assays. These findings, supported by in silico indications, allowed us to propose **VvibZIPC22** as a new regulator of flavonoid biosynthesis in grapevine.
