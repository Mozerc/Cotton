## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_17s0000g08960]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VIT_17s0000g08960</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Grape Genome Database v2.1]()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Genetic variation of **VIT_17s0000g08960** coding for a raffinose synthase was further investigated by resequencing the gene of 85 individuals since a SNP located in the region (chr17_10,497,222_C_T) was significantly associated with stomatal conductance.
   - These genotypes were selected both to represent putatively different classes of response to water stress and based on the SNP chr17_10,497,222_C_T at the candidate gene **VIT_17s0000g08960**
   - The analysis of the **VIT_17s0000g08960** transcripts during water deficit revealed that this gene was modulated only in SO4 vines. A significantly higher expression was detected after four days, when plants start to perceive the symptoms of stress, indicating that it might be implicated in early response to drought stress.
