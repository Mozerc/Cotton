## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_212s0028g02590]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvbZIP61</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Basic leucine zipper gene **VvbZIP61** is expressed at a quantitative trait locus for high monoterpene content in grape berries.
   - These genes, including the basic leucine zipper **VvbZIP61** gene on chromosome 12, are therefore considered as potentially being involved in monoterpene metabolism.
   - Overexpression of **VvbZIP61** in Vitis amurensis callus through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation significantly increased the accumulation of several monoterpenes in the callus, including nerol, linalool, geranial, geraniol, Î²-myrcene, and D-limonene.
   - It is hypothesized that **VvbZIP61** expression acts to increase muscat flavor in grapes.
