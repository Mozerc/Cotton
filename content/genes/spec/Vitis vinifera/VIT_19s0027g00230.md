## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_19s0027g00230]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VviNAC33</u>
- **Gene Name:** NAC transcription factor 33
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **VviNAC33** promotes organ de-greening and represses vegetative growth during the vegetative-to-mature phase transition in grapevine.
   - Demonstrated that **VviNAC33** induces leaf de-greening, inhibits organ growth and directly activates the expression of STAY-GREEN PROTEIN 1 (SGR1), which is involved in Chl and photosystem degradation, and AUTOPHAGY 8f (ATG8f), which is involved in the maturation of autophagosomes.
   - **VviNAC33** directly inhibits AUXIN EFFLUX FACILITATOR PIN1, RopGEF1 and ATP SYNTHASE GAMMA CHAIN 1T (ATPC1), which are involved in photosystem II integrity and activity.
   - **VviNAC33** plays a major role in terminating photosynthetic activity and organ growth as part of a regulatory network governing the vegetative-to-mature phase transition.
   - **VviNAC33** is directly involved in shutting down photosynthesis in greened organs that enter the vegetative-to-mature phase transition.
