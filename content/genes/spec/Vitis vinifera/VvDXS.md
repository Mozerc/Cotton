## Gene Details:

- **Gene Name:** 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A structural gene of the plastidial methyl-erythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (**VvDXS**), was recently suggested as a candidate gene for this trait, having been co-localized with a major quantitative trait locus for linalool, nerol, and geraniol concentrations in berries.
   - The significance of this nucleotide difference was investigated by comparing the monoterpene profiles with the expression of **VvDXS** alleles throughout berry development in Moscato Bianco, a cultivar heterozygous for the SNP mutation.
   - Although correlation was detected between the **VvDXS** transcript profile and the accumulation of free monoterpenol odorants, the modulation of **VvDXS** expression during berry development appears to be independent of nucleotide variation in the coding sequence.
   - These findings confirm a functional effect of the **VvDXS** gene polymorphism and may pave the way for metabolic engineering of terpenoid contents in grapevine.
