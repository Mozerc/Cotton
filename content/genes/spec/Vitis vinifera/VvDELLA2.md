## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvDELLA2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Spatiotemporal analysis of VvDELLAs showed that both VvDELLA1 and **VvDELLA2** are abundant in most tissues, except in developing fruit where **VvDELLA2** is uniquely expressed at high levels, suggesting a key role in fruit development.
   - VvDELLA1 and **VvDELLA2** mRNA levels increased in mature tissue. VvDELLA3 expression also increased in mature rachis but decreased in mature tendrils.
   - Our results further suggest that differential organ responses to exogenous GA depend on the levels of VvDELLA proteins and endogenous bioactive GAs. Understanding this interaction will allow better manipulation of GA signalling in grapevine.
