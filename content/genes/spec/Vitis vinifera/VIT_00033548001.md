## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_00033548001]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvSUN</u>
- **Gene Name:** protein IQ-DOMAIN 12
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **VvSUN** may act in the auxin pathway to regulate fruit shape in grape,**VvSUN**, which belongs to the SUN/IQ67-DOMAIN (IQD) family, localizes to the plasma membrane and chloroplast and may be involved in controlling fruit shape through auxin.
   - Functional analyses illustrated that **VvSUN** gene overexpression in tomato and tobacco plants changed fruit/pod shape.
   - The **VvSUN** promoter directly bound to VvARF6 in yeast and activated ÃŸ-glucuronidase (GUS) activity by indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) treatments in grapevine leaves, indicating that **VvSUN** functions are in coordination with auxin.
   - It is possible that **VvSUN** acts as a hub gene, altering cellular auxin levels and the plant hormone signal transduction pathway, which plays a role in cell division patterns, leading to anisotropic growth of the ovary and, ultimately, an elongated fruit shape.
