## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_02s0087g00710]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvHyd2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 8′-hydroxylase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - At this point in the culture, our results suggest that of those genes involved in ABA accumulation, one (VvNCED1) was repressed, while another (VvBG2) was activated. Similarly, of those genes related to a reduction in ABA levels, one (VvUGT) was repressed while another (**VvHyd2**) was activated.
   - The role of the CYP707A gene (**VvHyd2**), which encodes the 8′-hydroxylase enzyme, in the reduction of ABA levels is well known. 
   - The expression analyses of the **VvHyd2**, VvUGT and VvBG2 genes performed in this study provide new information about molecular regulation during the maturation of grapevine somatic embryos.
   - In addition, the data from the relative gene expression of ABA-producing (VvNCED1 and VvBG2) and ABA-degrading (VvUGT and **VvHyd2**) genes suggested another important point of control of ABA levels during the differentiation of grapevine somatic embryos in the fourth week of culture over the semipermeable membrane.
