## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CpTGG1</u>
- **Gene Name:** beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Carica papaya*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of a Novel β-thioglucosidase **CpTGG1** in Carica papaya and its Substrate-dependent and Ascorbic Acid-independent O-β-glucosidase Activity.
   - The recombinant **CpTGG1** expressed in Pichia pastoris catalyzed the hydrolysis of both sinigrin and glucotropaeolin (the only thioglucoside present in papaya), showing that **CpTGG1** was indeed a functional myrosinase gene. 
   - Sequence alignment analysis indicated that **CpTGG1** contained all the motifs conserved in functional myrosinases from crucifers, except for two aglycon-binding motifs, suggesting substrate priority variation of the non-cruciferous myrosinases. 
   - **CpTGG1** displayed substrate-dependent and ascorbic acid-independent O-β-glucosidase activity towards 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside and 4-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, but was inactive towards glucovanillin and n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside.
