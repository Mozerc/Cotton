## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CpTM6-2</u>
- **Gene Name:** B-class MADS-box protein TM6-2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Carica papaya*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - While phylogenetic analyses show that CpPI is the ortholog of the Arabidopsis gene PI, the CpTM6-1 and **CpTM6-2** loci are representatives of the paralogous TM6 lineage that contain paleoAP3 motifs unlike the euAP3 gene observed in Arabidopsis.
   - CpTM6-1 expressed at low levels in sepals and carpels, whereas **CpTM6-2** expressed at a low level in sepals and at a high level in leaves.
   - CpTM6-1 expression was detectable in sepal and carpels of hermaphrodite flowers and carpels of female flowers. **CpTM6-2** transcripts were also abundant in petals and stamens of hermaphrodite flowers, petals of female flower, and petals and stamens of male flowers. 
   - Our results showed that B-class gene homologs could function as predicted by the ABC model in trioecous flowers but differential expressions of CpTM6-1, and **CpTM6-2**, and CpPI suggested the diversification of their functions after the duplication events.
