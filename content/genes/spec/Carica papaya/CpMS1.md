## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CpMS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** MALE STERILITY 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Carica papaya*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - No amplification of the **CpMS1** gene was detected in any of the female flower samples, supporting the RNA-Seq results and **CpMS1** participation on male flower organ development.
   - Identified a Male Sterility 1 gene (**CpMS1**) highly up-regulated in male and hermaphrodite flower buds compared to female flower buds, which expresses in small male flower buds (3–8 mm), and that might be playing an important role in male flower organ development due to its homology to MS1 genes previously identified in other plants.
   - **CpMS1** was expressed in papaya male and hermaphrodite flowers at early stages, suggesting that this gene might participate in male flower organ development processes, nevertheless, this gene cannot be considered a sex-determination gene.
   - The major finding of this study was a Male Sterility 1 gene (**CpMS1**) highly up-regulated in male and hermaphrodite flower buds compared to female flower buds, with tissue (only flower buds) and developmental specific (expressed in male flower buds of 3 to 8mm) expression.
