## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Bol013612]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Cgl2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Cabbage glossy 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica oleracea*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Cgl2** plays an essential role in cuticular wax biosynthesis in cabbage.
   - We fine-mapped a wax synthesis gene using the F2 populations, analyzed the genes present in the candidate region, and identified Bol013612, which is homologous to CER4, as a candidate gene for **Cgl2**.
   - The gene responsible for the glossy green trait in LD10GL is named as **Cgl2** for the reason that **Cgl2** is the 2nd gene which was fine-mapped and cloned in cabbage (the 1st gene fine-mapped and cloned was named Cgl1).
   - The identification of **Cgl2** gene will enhance our understanding about its role in cabbage wax biosynthesis and lays a foundation for further study of cabbage wax metabolism.
