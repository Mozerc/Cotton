## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PsAS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Asparagine synthetase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pinus sylvestris*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Coordination of **PsAS1** and PsASPG expression controls timing of re-allocated N utilization in hypocotyls of pine seedlings.
   - The increase in transcript abundance observed at advanced stages of hypocotyl development was concomitant with a decrease of **PsAS1** transcript abundance and a remarkable increase in the number of xylem elements and highly lignified cell walls.
   - The increase in PsASPG transcript abundance observed at hypocotyl development stages H3 and H4, concomitant with the drastic decrease in **PsAS1** transcript levels, suggests that high levels of ASPG are involved in the mobilization of the asparagine accumulated in the hypocotyl.
   - These results, together with the precise localization of PsASPG transcripts in cells of the cambial region, suggest that the expression of **PsAS1** and PsASPG is temporally coordinated, to control the re-allocation of N from seed storage proteins toward the hypocotyl to be later used during early development of secondary vascular system.
