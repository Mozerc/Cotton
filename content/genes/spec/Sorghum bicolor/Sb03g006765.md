## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Sb03g006765]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SbPSTOL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** PHOSPHORUS-STARVATION TOLERANCE1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Sorghum bicolor*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SbPSTOL1** genes colocalized with quantitative trait loci for traits underlying root morphology and dry weight accumulation under low P via linkage mapping.
   - Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within PSTOL1 homologs in sorghum, collectively designated **SbPSTOL1**, were significantly associated with grain yield under low-P conditions and also root morphology and root system architecture (RSA) traits phenotyped from hydroponically grown plants.
   - Our results indicate that **SbPSTOL1** homologs have the ability to enhance P uptake and sorghum performance in low-P soils by a mechanism related not only to early root growth enhancement, as was the case for rice OsPSTOL1, but also by modulating RSA.
   - This study indicates that multiple **SbPSTOL1** genes have a more general role in the root system, not only enhancing root morphology traits but also changing root system architecture, which leads to grain yield gain under low-P availability in the soil.
