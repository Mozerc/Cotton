## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BplncSIR1</u>
- **Gene Name:** salt-responsive nuclear lncRNA
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Betula platyphylla*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Birch plants overexpressing and knocking out for **BplncSIR1** were generated. **BplncSIR1** was found to improve salt tolerance by inducing antioxidant activity and stomatal closure, and also accelerate plant growth.
   - Plants overexpressing and knocking out for BpNAC2 were generated. Consistent with that of **BplncSIR1**, overexpression of BpNAC2 also accelerated plant growth and conferred salt tolerance.
   - **BplncSIR1** serves as the regulator of BpNAC2 to induce its expression in response to salt stress, and activated BpNAC2 accelerates plant growth and improves salt tolerance. 
   - **BplncSIR1** might be a candidate gene for molecular breeding to cultivate plants with both a high growth rate and improved salt tolerance.
