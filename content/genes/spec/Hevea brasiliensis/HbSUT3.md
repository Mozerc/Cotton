## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HbSUT3</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose transporter 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hevea brasiliensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **HbSUT3** encodes a functional sucrose transporter that exhibits high sucrose affinity with a Km value of 1.24mm at pH 4.0, and possesses features typical of sucrose/H+ symporters.
   - **HbSUT3** was found to be the predominant member expressed in the rubber-containing cytoplasm (latex) of laticifers.
   - **HbSUT3** expression is induced by the latex stimulator Ethrel (an ethylene generator), and relates to its yield-stimulating effect. Tapping (the act of rubber harvesting) markedly increased the expression of **HbSUT3**, whereas wounding alone had little effect.
   - The expression of **HbSUT3** was found to be positively correlated with latex yield. Taken together, our results provide evidence favouring the involvement of **HbSUT3** in sucrose loading into laticifers and in rubber productivity.
