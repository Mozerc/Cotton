## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HbPLT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** putative polyol transporter protein 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hevea brasiliensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Screening a latex-derived cDNA library using polyol transporter-specific probes, two full-length cDNAs were isolated, and named **HbPLT1** and HbPLT2 (for Hevea brasiliensis polyol transporter 1 and 2, respectively).
   - **HbPLT1** and HbPLT2 expression patterns varied in response to different stimuli. Bark treatment with ethylene resulted in an early and significant up-regulation of HbPLT2 transcripts in laticifers as well as in inner bark cells, when compared with **HbPLT1**. Other treatments, especially mechanical wounding, strongly induced HbPLT2 transcripts.
   - Ethylene effect on the expression pattern of **HbPLT1** and HbPLT2 in the latex and bark of virgin trees.
   - **HbPLT1** transcripts were accumulated in latex within the first 4â€‰h (3-fold), before returning to their basal level as soon as 8h after ethylene treatment.
