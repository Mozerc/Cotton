## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>JrPPO1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Juglans regia*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **JrPPO1** was highly expressed in stems, young leaves, mature leaves, catkins, pistils, and hulls.
   - Compared with JrPPO2, **JrPPO1** exhibited a greater activity towards monophenols, whereas JrPPO2 was more active towards o-diphenols.
   - The relative expression of **JrPPO1** and JrPPO2 in the explants cultured in different media exhibited opposite trends, and the trend of JrPPO2 expression was similar to the trend of PPO activity, which suggests that JrPPO2 plays an important role in the browning effect of phenolic compounds.
   - JrPPO expression and phenolic content levels were determined in explants to elucidate the relationship between explant browning and JrPPOs and to provide new methods and theories for walnut tissue culture.
