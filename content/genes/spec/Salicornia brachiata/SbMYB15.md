## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SbMYB15</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3 type MYB15
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Salicornia brachiata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of a novel **SbMYB15** from Salicornia brachiata confers salinity and dehydration tolerance by reduced oxidative damage and improved photosynthesis in transgenic tobacco.
   - **SbMYB15**, R2R3-type MYB was induced by the different stresses, and conferred stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco by regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes.
   - The **SbMYB15** acts as a transcriptional activator. Transcriptional analysis showed that **SbMYB15** transcript was strongly upregulated in red shoots and was also induced by different stresses| however, its expression remained unchanged with ABA.
   - Overexpression of **SbMYB15** in tobacco significantly improved salinity and dehydration tolerance. The enhanced tolerance of the transgenic plants was defined by the changes in chlorophyll, malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, total soluble sugar and total amino acid contents.
