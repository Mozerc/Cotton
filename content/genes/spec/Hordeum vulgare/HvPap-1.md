## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvPap-1</u>
- **Gene Name:** putative cysteine proteinase precursor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A cathepsin F-like peptidase involved in barley grain protein mobilization, **HvPap-1**, is modulated by its own propeptide and by cystatins.
   - The expression of **HvPap-1** in several barley tissues, its subcellular location in embryos, and its response in aleurone layers to GA are shown.
   - The functional role of **HvPap-1** in mobilizing storage proteins, mainly hordeins, regulated either by specific inhibitors (cystatins) or by its own propeptide is also discussed.
   - These three features support the implication of **HvPap-1** in storage protein mobilization during grain germination. In addition, a complex regulation exerted by the barley cystatins, which are cysteine protease inhibitors, and by its own propeptide, is also described.
