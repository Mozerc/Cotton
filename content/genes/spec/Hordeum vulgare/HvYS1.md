## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvYS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** iron–phytosiderophore transporter
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We identified a gene specifically encoding an iron–phytosiderophore transporter (**HvYS1**) in barley, which is the most tolerant species to iron deficiency among graminaceous plants.
   - **HvYS1** was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 678 amino acids and to have 72.7% identity with ZmYS1, a first protein identified as an iron(III)–phytosiderophore transporter in maize. 
   - Expression of **HvYS1** in Xenopus oocytes showed strict specificity for both metals and ligands: **HvYS1** transports only iron(III) chelated with phytosiderophore.
   - The localization and substrate specificity of **HvYS1** is different from those of ZmYS1, indicating that **HvYS1** is a specific transporter for iron(III)–phytosiderophore involved in primary iron acquisition from soil in barley roots.
   - The expression of **HvYS1** was specifically induced by Fe deficiency only in barley roots, and increased with the progress of Fe deficiency, whereas ZmYS1 was expressed in maize in the leaf blades and sheaths, crown, and seminal roots, but not in the hypocotyl.
   - The expression of **HvYS1** showed a distinct diurnal rhythm, reaching a maximum before the onset of phytosiderophore secretion. In contrast, ZmYS1 did not show such a rhythm in expression.
