## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvBot1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Clipper boron transporter
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Similar to **HvBot1**, the tolerant HvNIP2|1 allele was unique to the Sahara barley accessions. We identified a new source of the 2H B tolerance allele controlling leaf symptom development, in the landrace Ethiopia 756.
   - Ethiopia 756, as well as the cultivar Sloop Vic which carries both the 2H and **HvBot1** B tolerance alleles derived from Sahara 3771, may be valuable as alternative parents in breeding programs targeted to high soil B environments.
   - Coding sequence for the genes encoding B transport proteins **HvBot1** and HvNIP2|1, and which lie beneath the 4H and 6H tolerance loci, respectively, was also amplified and sequenced. 
   - The remaining genotypes showed no clear relationship between allele type at **HvBot1** and either leaf symptom score or leaf B concentrations.
