## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvPAPhy_a</u>
- **Gene Name:** phytase purple acid phosphatase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Barley **HvPAPhy_a** as transgene provides high and stable phytase activities in mature barley straw and in grains.
   - The phytase purple acid phosphatase (**HvPAPhy_a**) expressed during barley seed development was evaluated as transgene for overexpression in barley. 
   - The T2-generation of **HvPAPhy_a** transformed barley showed phytase activity increases up to 19-fold (29 000 phytase units (FTU) per kg in mature grains).
   - The **HvPAPhy_a**-transformed barley plants with high phytase activities possess triple potential utilities for the improvement of phosphate bioavailability.
