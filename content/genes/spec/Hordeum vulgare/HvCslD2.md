## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvCslD2</u>
- **Gene Name:** cellulose synthase-like D2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The barley (Hordeum vulgare) cellulose synthase-like D2 gene (**HvCslD2**) mediates penetration resistance to host-adapted and nonhost isolates of the powdery mildew fungus.
   - To investigate the role in plant defence of a candidate gene from barley (Hordeum vulgare) encoding cellulose synthase-like D2 (**HvCslD2**), we generated transgenic barley plants in which **HvCslD2** was silenced through RNA interference (RNAi).
   - This result also indicates that the constitutively reduced **HvCslD2** mRNA levels in the transgenic plants did not irreversibly change the cell wall properties with respect to powdery mildew resistance.
   - The results suggest that **HvCslD2**-mediated cell wall changes in the epidermal layer represent an important defence reaction both for nonhost and for quantitative host resistance against nonadapted wheat and host-adapted barley powdery mildew pathogens, respectively.
