## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [HORVU4Hr1G063420.2]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvKCS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** β-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The β-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase **HvKCS1**, Encoded by Cer-zh, Plays a Key Role in Synthesis of Barley Leaf Wax and Germination of Barley Powdery Mildew.
   - Positional cloning of the gene mutated in cer-zh identified an elongase component, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (CER-ZH/**HvKCS1**) that is one of 34 homologous KCSs encoded by the barley genome.
   - The biochemical function of **HvKCS1** was deduced from wax and cutin analysis of the cer-zh.54 mutant and its heterologous expression in yeast cells. The contribution of **HvKCS1** to water barrier properties of the cuticle, and its role in spore germination of barley powdery mildew fungus were also assessed.
   - These experiments revealed that CER-ZH/**HvKCS1** has a substrate specificity for C16–C20, especially unsaturated, acyl chains, thus playing a major role in total acyl chain elongation for wax biosynthesis.
