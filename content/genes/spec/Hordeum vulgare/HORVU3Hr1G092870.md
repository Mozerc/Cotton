## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [HORVU3Hr1G092870]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvNPF2.12</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Convergently selected NPF2.12 coordinates root growth and nitrogen use efficiency in wheat and barley.
   - Here, we performed a genome-wide scan using wheat and barley accessions characterized under low and high N inputs that uncovered the NPF2.12 gene, encoding a homolog of the Arabidopsis nitrate transceptor NRT1.6 and other low-affinity nitrate transporters that belong to the MAJOR FACILITATOR SUPERFAMILY.
   - The nitrate reductase encoding gene NIA1 was up-regulated in npf2.12 mutant upon low nitrate concentrations, thereby resulting in elevated levels of nitric oxide (NO) production. This increase in NO correlated with the higher root growth, nitrate uptake, and N translocation observed in the mutant when compared to wild-type.
   - The presented data indicate that the elite haplotype alleles of NPF2.12 are convergently selected in wheat and barley that by inactivation indirectly contribute to root growth and NUE by activating NO signaling under low nitrate conditions.
