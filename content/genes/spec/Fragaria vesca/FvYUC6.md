## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FvYUC6</u>
- **Gene Name:** YUCCA6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria vesca*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functionality of the **FvYUC6** gene was studied in transgenic strawberry overexpressing **FvYUC6**, which showed typical high-auxin phenotypes.
   - Overexpression of **FvYUC6** also delayed flowering and led to complete male sterility in F. vesca. Additionally, specific repression of **FvYUC6** expression by RNA interference significantly inhibited vegetative growth and reduced plant fertility.
   - The development of leaves, roots, flowers, and fruits was greatly affected in **FvYUC6**-repressed plants. Expression of a subset of auxin-responsive genes was well correlated with the changes of **FvYUC6** transcript levels and free indole-3-acetic acid levels in transgenic strawberry.
   - These observations are consistent with an important role of **FvYUC6** in auxin synthesis, and support a main role of the gene product in vegetative and reproductive development in woodland strawberry.
