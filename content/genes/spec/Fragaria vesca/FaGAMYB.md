## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaGAMYB</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB transcription factor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria vesca*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Central role of **FaGAMYB** in the transition of the strawberry receptacle from development to ripening.
   - Transient silencing of **FaGAMYB** using RNAi and further determination of changes in global gene expression by RNAseq, and composition of primary and secondary metabolites have been used to investigate the role played by this gene during the development of the receptacle.
   - Down-regulation of **FaGAMYB** caused an arrest in the ripening of the receptacle and inhibited colour formation.
   - **FaGAMYB** silencing also caused a reduction of ABA biosynthesis and sucrose content. Interestingly, exogenous ABA application to the RNAI-transformed receptacle reversed most defects caused by **FaGAMYB** down-regulation.
   - The study assigns a key regulatory role to **FaGAMYB** in the initiation of strawberry receptacle ripening and acting upstream of the known regulator ABA.
