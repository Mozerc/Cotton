## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [FvH4_2g31400]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FvWRKY50</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY transcription factor 50
- **Genome:** [F. vesca subsp. vesca reference genome (https://www.rosaceae.org/rosaceae_downloads/Fragaria_vesca/Fvesca-genome.v4.0.a1/assembly/Fragaria_vesca_v4.0.a1.fasta.gz)]()
- **Species:** *Fragaria vesca*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **FvWRKY50** is an important gene that regulates both vegetative growth and reproductive growth in strawberry.
   - identified a WRKY transcription factor, **FvWRKY50**, in diploid strawberry which played essential roles in strawberry vegetative growth, and reproductive growth.
   - Knocking out **FvWRKY50** by genome editing accelerated flowering time and leaf senescence but delayed anthocyanin accumulation in fruit.
   - **FvWRKY50** directly upregulated the expression of FvCHI and FvDFR by binding their promoter under normal conditions, but at low temperature **FvWRKY50** was phosphorylated by FvMAPK3 and then induced protein degradation by ubiquitination, delaying anthocyanin accumulation.
   - The homozygous mutant of **FvWRKY50** was smaller while the biallelic mutant showed normal size. These new findings provide important clues for us to further reveal the regulatory mechanisms of strawberry growth and fruit ripening
