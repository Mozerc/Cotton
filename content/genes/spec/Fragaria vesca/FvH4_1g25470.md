## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [FvH4_1g25470]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FvePHP</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [F. vesca Genome v4.0.a1(https://www.rosaceae.org/species/fragaria/fragaria_vesca)]()
- **Species:** *Fragaria vesca*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A splice site mutation in the **FvePHP** gene is associated with leaf development and flowering time in woodland strawberry.
   - **FvePHP** was localized in the nucleus and was highly expressed in leaves. Silencing of **FvePHP** using the virus-induced gene silencing method resulted in partial developmental defects in strawberry leaves.
   - Overexpression of the **FvePHP** gene can largely restore the mutant phenotype.
   - Our results indicate that mutation in **FvePHP** is associated with multiple developmental pathways. These results aid in understanding the role of DNA polymerase in strawberry development.
