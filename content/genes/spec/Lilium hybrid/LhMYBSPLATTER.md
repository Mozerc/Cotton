## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LhMYBSPLATTER|LhMYB12-Lat</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lilium hybrid*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcription factor (TF) **LhMYBSPLATTER|LhMYB12-Lat** (formerly known as **LhMYBSPLATTER|LhMYB12-Lat**), identified as the major kernel protein, regulating the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in ‘Tiny Padhye’ of Tango Series cultivars, which the pigmentation density is high in the lower half of tepals and this patterning is of exceptional ornamental value.
   - **LhMYBSPLATTER|LhMYB12-Lat** is a crucial transcription factor among various pathways that regulates pigmentation at splatter-type spots in lilies.
   - **LhMYBSPLATTER|LhMYB12-Lat**, a positive transcription factor, was shown to regulate pigmentation at splatter-type spots in the Asiatic hybrid lilies Tango Series cultivars, and its expression was consistent with that of anthocyanin structural genes
   - Our results are the first to identify them in tepals, and may provide theoretical support and possible research directions for identifying the regulatory associations between potential TFs and **LhMYBSPLATTER|LhMYB12-Lat** gene promoter. Further studies are still needed to verify their functions as anthocyanin regulators.
