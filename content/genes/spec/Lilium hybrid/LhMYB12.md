## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LhMYB12</u>
- **Gene Name:**  R2R3-MYB transcription factor 12
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lilium hybrid*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The novel allele of the **LhMYB12** gene is involved in splatter-type spot formation on the flower tepals of Asiatic hybrid lilies.
   - Previously characterized **LhMYB12** regulators were not involved in splatter pigmentation, but, instead, a new allele of the **LhMYB12** gene, **LhMYB12**-Lat, isolated in this study, contributed to splatter development.
   - Progeny segregation analysis showed that **LhMYB12**-Lat genotype and splatter phenotype were co-segregated among the F1 population, indicating that **LhMYB12**-Lat determines the presence or absence of splatters.
   - **LhMYB12**-Lat contributes to splatter development, but not to full-tepal pigmentation and raised spot pigmentation. As a result of its unique sequences and different transcription profiles, this new allele of **LhMYB12** should be a novel R2R3-MYB specifically associating with splatter spot development.
