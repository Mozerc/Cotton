## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ShSUT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose transporter 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Saccharum hybrid*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here we present a functional analysis of the SUT **ShSUT1** from sugarcane, an important crop species grown for its ability to accumulate high amounts of sucrose in the stem.
   - **ShSUT1** was previously shown to be expressed in maturing stems and plays an important role in the accumulation of sucrose in this tissue.
   - We also found that the sucrose analog sucralose (4,1′,6′-trichloro-4,1′,6′-trideoxy-galacto-sucrose) is a competitive inhibitor of **ShSUT1** with an inhibition coefficient (Ki) of 16.5mM.
   - **ShSUT1** may play a role in retrieval of sucrose leaking from the storage parenchyma cells in the stem or alternatively in sucrose export in sinks rather than in phloem loading.
