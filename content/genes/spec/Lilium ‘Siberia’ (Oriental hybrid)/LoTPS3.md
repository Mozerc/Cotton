## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LoTPS3</u>
- **Gene Name:** terpene synthase 3
- **Genome:** [Lilium ‘Siberia’ (Oriental hybrid)]()
- **Species:** *Lilium ‘Siberia’ (Oriental hybrid)*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Floral scent formation in Lilium ‘Siberia’ is mainly due to monoterpene presence in the floral profile. LoTPS1 and **LoTPS3** are responsible for the formation of (±)-linalool and β-ocimene in Lilium ‘Siberia’.
   - Two terpene synthase genes (LoTPS1 and **LoTPS3**), which are highly expressed in sepals and petals of Lilium ‘Siberia’ flower were functionally characterized recombinant LoTPS1 specifically catalyzes the formation of (Z)-β-ocimene and (±)-linalool as its main volatile compounds from geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), whereas **LoTPS3** is a promiscuous monoterpene synthase which utilizes both GPP and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) as a substrate to generate (±)-linalool and cis-nerolidol, respectively.
   - Regarding mechanical wounding, both genes showed considerable involvement in floral defense by inducing the emission of (Z)-β-ocimene and (±)-linalool, elevating the transcript accumulation of LoTPS1 and **LoTPS3**.
   - Our findings on these two TPSs (LoTPS1 and **LoTPS3**) characterized from Lilium ‘Siberia’ provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of terpene biosynthesis in this species and also provide an opportunity for biotechnological modification of floral scent profile of Lilium.
