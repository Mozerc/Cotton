## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Dca5929]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DcWRKY75</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY transcription factor75
- **Genome:** [Carnation Genome database (http://carnation.kazusa.or.jp)]()
- **Species:** *Dianthus caryophyllus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The transcription factors DcHB30 and **DcWRKY75** antagonistically regulate ethylene-induced petal senescence in carnation.
   - We found that silencing DcHB30 accelerated ethylene-induced petal senescence and that DcHB30 physically interacts with **DcWRKY75**, a positive regulator of ethylene-induced petal senescence.
   - Phenotypic characterization and molecular evidence indicated that DcHB30 and **DcWRKY75** competitively regulate the expression of their co-targeted genes DcACS1, DcACO1, DcSAG12, and DcSAG29 by reciprocally inhibiting the DNA-binding activity of each other on the gene promoters.
   - We demonstrate that DcHB30 delays petal senescence by interacting with **DcWRKY75** and inhibiting its DNA-binding activity on the promoters of co-targeted genes. This mechanism provides a potential new strategy for fine-tuning the postharvest preservation of cut carnation flowers.
