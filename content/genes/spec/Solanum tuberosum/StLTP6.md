## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StLTP6</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) non-specific lipid transfer protein **StLTP6** promotes viral infection by inhibiting virus-induced RNA silencing.
   - Found that **StLTP6** expression was remarkably upregulated in potato infected with potato virus Y and potato virus S. The infection efficiency and virus content of **StLTP6**-overexpressed potato and Nicotiana benthamiana were remarkable increased.
   - This result indicated that **StLTP6** expression was induced during viral infection to inhibit the resistance of virus-induced RNA silencing and promote viral infection.
   - Reported the role of **StLTP6** in viral infection, broadening the biological function range of the nsLTP family and providing valuable information for the study of viral infection mechanism.
