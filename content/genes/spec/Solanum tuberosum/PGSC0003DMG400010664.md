## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [PGSC0003DMG400010664]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StBAM9</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [potato genome sequence consortium database (http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu/pgsc_download.shtml)]()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Genetic transformation of these amylases in potatoes by RNA interference showed that Î²-amylase activity could be decreased in cold-stored tubers by silencing of StBAM1 and collective silencing of StBAM1 and **StBAM9**.
   - Silencing StBAM1 and **StBAM9** caused starch accumulation and lower RS, which was more evident in simultaneously silenced lines, suggesting functional redundancy.
   - Soluble starch content increased in RNAi-StBAM1 lines but decreased in RNAi-**StBAM9** lines, suggesting that StBAM1 may regulate CIS by hydrolysing soluble starch and **StBAM9** by directly acting on starch granules.
   - Our findings suggest that StAmy23, StBAM1, and **StBAM9** function in potato CIS with varying levels of impact.
