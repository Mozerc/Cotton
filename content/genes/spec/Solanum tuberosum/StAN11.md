## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StAN11</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **StAN11**, a WD40-repeat gene, was cloned from potato cultivar Chieftain (Solanum tuberosum L.). **StAN11** (HQ599506) contained no intron and its open reading frame (ORF) was 1,029bp long, encoding a putative protein of 342 amino acids.
   - The color of transgenic tuber skin was significantly deepened, compared to the wild-type control, which was highly consistent with the accumulation of anthocyanin and expression of **StAN11** in transgenic lines tuber skin.
   - The **StAN11** gene is a homolog of a regulatory gene that is involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway.
   - Overexpression of **StAN11** promotes anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic potato tuber skin.
   - This result suggested that **StAN11** regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis in potato by controlling DFR expression and accumulation of anthocyanin could be increased through overexpression of **StAN11** in the tubers with the genetic background of anthocyanin biosynthesis.
