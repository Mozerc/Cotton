## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StPP2Ac2b</u>
- **Gene Name:** protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit **StPP2Ac2b** is involved in the control of potato tuber sprouting and source–sink balance in tubers and sprouts.
   - **StPP2Ac2b** overexpression delays tuber sprouting and affects apical dominance and sprout growth.
   - We also determined that **StPP2Ac2b** is involved in the regulation of starch and sucrose metabolism, the response to GA, and the control of source–sink balance in tubers and sprouts.
   - Demonstrating that the catalytic subunit **StPP2Ac2b** positively modulates tuber induction, and that its function is related to the regulation of gibberellic acid metabolism.
   - Overexpression of **StPP2Ac2b** alters the source–sink balance, increasing the source capacity of the tuber, and the sink strength of the sprout to support its accelerated growth.
