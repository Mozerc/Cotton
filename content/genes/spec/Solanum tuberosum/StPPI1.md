## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StPPI1</u>
- **Gene Name:** proton pump interactor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of **StPPI1**, a proton pump interactor from Solanum tuberosum L. that is up-regulated during tuber development and by abiotic stress.
   - The full-length coding sequence of **StPPI1** was obtained. The open reading frame (ORF) encodes a protein of 629 amino acids showing 50% identity with A. thaliana PPI1 protein. 
   - **StPPI1** mRNA levels significantly increase during tuber development. **StPPI1** is induced by salt stress and cold. Drought and mechanical wounding slightly increase **StPPI1** transcript levels.
   - In addition, the expression of SlPPI1, the tomato homolog of **StPPI1**, was determined under adverse environmental conditions in tomato plants. SlPPI1 mRNA levels are increased by drought and cold, but are unaffected by salt stress. Mechanical wounding slightly increases SlPPI1 expression.
