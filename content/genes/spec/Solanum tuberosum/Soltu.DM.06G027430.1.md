## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Soltu.DM.06G027430.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StMLP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **StMLP1**, as a Kunitz trypsin inhibitor, enhances potato resistance and specifically expresses in vascular bundles during Ralstonia solanacearum infection.
   - **StMLP1** as an inducible promoter that can be triggered by R. solanacearum and as a tissue-specific promoter with specificity for vascular bundle expression.
   - Our findings demonstrate that **StMLP1** exhibits trypsin inhibitor activity, and that its signal peptide is essential for proper localization and function. Overexpression of **StMLP1** in potato can enhance the resistance to R. solanacearum.
   - The RNA-seq results of the overexpression-**StMLP1** lines indicated that **StMLP1** was involved in potato immunity. All these findings in our study reveal that **StMLP1** functions as a positive regulator that is induced and specifically expressed in vascular bundles in response to R. solanacearum infection.
