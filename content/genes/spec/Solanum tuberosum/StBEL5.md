## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StBEL5</u>
- **Gene Name:** BEL1-related homeotic protein 5
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The level of **StBEL5** mRNA increased in response to a short-day photoperiod in both leaves and stolons. Similar to sense mutants of POTH1, transgenic lines that overexpressed **StBEL5** exhibited enhanced tuber formation even under noninductive conditions.
   - Both **StBEL5** and POTH1 sense lines exhibited an increase in cytokinin levels in shoot tips. **StBEL5** lines also exhibited a decrease in the levels of GA 20-oxidase1 mRNA in stolon tips from long-day plants.
   - Enhanced Tuber Formation in Transgenic Plants That Overexpress the BEL cDNA, **StBEL5**.
   - These results indicate that the enhancement of tuber formation in **StBEL5** overexpression lines is not mediated by an indirect increase in POTH1 expression.
   - Using a transgenic approach, it is shown that the StPTB family of RNA-binding proteins regulate specific stages of development through an interaction with phloem-mobile transcripts of **StBEL5**.
