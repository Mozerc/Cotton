## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Soltu.DM.04G035210]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StEXA1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Essential for potexvirus Accumulation 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Susceptibility factor **StEXA1** interacts with StnCBP to facilitate potato virus Y accumulation through the stress granule-dependent RNA regulatory pathway in potato.
   - EXA1 knockdown in potato (**StEXA1**) was found to confer novel resistance to potato virus Y (PVY, potyvirus) in a strain-specific manner. It significantly compromised PVYO accumulation but not PVYN:O and PVYNTN.
   - The accumulation of PVYO was mainly dependent on the stress granules (SGs) induced by **StEXA1** and StnCBP, whereas PVYN:O and PVYNTN could induce SGs by HC-ProN independently through an unknown mechanism.
   - A hypothetical model was proposed for understanding the mechanism by which **StEXA1** interacts with StnCBP to facilitate PVY accumulation in potato through the SG-dependent RNA regulatory pathway.
