## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [PGSC0003DMG400003316]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StMYB44-1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - StMYB44 negatively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis at high temperatures in tuber flesh of potato.
   - StMYB44 represses anthocyanin accumulation in leaves of Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana by directly suppressing the activity of the dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) promoter.
   - **StMYB44-1** showed stronger repressive capacity than StMYB44-2, with both predicted proteins containing the repression-associated EAR motif with some variation.
   - **StMYB44-1** conferred repression without a requirement for a basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) partner, suggesting a different repression mechanism from that of reported anthocyanin repressors.
   - We propose that temperature-induced reduction of anthocyanin accumulation in potato flesh is caused by down-regulation of the activating anthocyanin regulatory complex, by enhancing the expression of flesh-specific StMYB44 and alteration of phenylpropanoid flux.
