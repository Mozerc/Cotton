## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StCDPK3</u>
- **Gene Name:** calcium dependent protein kinase3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The novel Solanum tuberosum calcium dependent protein kinase, **StCDPK3**, is expressed in actively growing organs.
   - In this work, isoform **StCDPK3** from Solanum tuberosum was studied and fully described. **StCDPK3** encodes a 63 kDa protein with an N-terminal variable domain (NTV), rich in prolines and glutamines, which presents myristoylation and palmitoylation consensus sites and a PEST sequence indicative of rapid protein degradation.
   - **StCDPK3** expression was enhanced by ABA while GA decreased it. Potato transgenic lines harboring **StCDPK3** promoterâˆ·GUS construct were generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated plant transformation.
   - Promoter activity was detected in leaves, root tips and branching points, early ES, tuber eyes and developing sprouts indicating that **StCDPK3** is expressed in actively growing organs.
