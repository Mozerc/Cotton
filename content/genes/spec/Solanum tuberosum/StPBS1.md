## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StPBS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Decoy engineering of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase **StPBS1** to defend against virus infection in potato.
   - The above data showed that **StPBS1** might affect immunity through potato proteins other than StRPS5 and StPBR1.
   - Downstream signalling of **StPBS1** was mediated by unknown resistance (R) proteins other than potato orthologues of AtRPS5 and HvPBR1, which is important for HvPBS1 signalling in barley.
   - We characterized the function of **StPBS1** in potato immunity and provide a biotechnology control method for PVY via transformation of decoy-engineered **StPBS1**NIa.
