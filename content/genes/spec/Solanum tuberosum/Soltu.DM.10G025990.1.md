## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Soltu.DM.10G025990.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StABL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** bZIP transcription factors StABI5-like 1
- **Genome:** [Spud DB (http://spuddb.uga.edu/)]()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **StABL1**, one of the members of the group A bZIP TF family involved in core ABA signaling, plays a positive role in regulating flowering, tuber formation, and life cycle length, through forming an alternative TAC (aTAC) and alternative FAC (aFAC) with StSP6A and StSP3D, respectively.
   - StAST1 (**StABL1** and StSP6A-associated TCP protein 1), a class I TCP TF, binding to StSP6A and **StABL1**, attenuates the formation of aTAC. Suppression of StAST1 significantly leads to early tuber formation and promotes early leaf maturation.
   - Combined with the observations that StAST1 also modulates ABA responses, possibly via its binding ability with **StABL1**, our findings suggest that the interaction of StAST1 with FT homolog and **StABL1** modulates the spatiotemporal activity of ABA/GA in the regulation of tuberization.
   - StABI5-like 1 (**StABL1**), a transcription factor central to abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, is a binding partner of StSP3D and StSP6A, forming an alternative florigen activation complex and alternative tuberigen activation complex in a 14-3-3-dependent manner.
   - Overexpression of **StABL1** results in the early initiation of flowering and tuberization as well as a short life cycle. Using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-sequencing, we demonstrate that AGAMOUS-like and GA 2-oxidase 1 genes are regulated by **StABL1**.
   - Our results suggest that **StABL1** functions with FT-like genes to promote flowering and tuberization and consequently life cycle length in potato, providing insight into the pleiotropic functioning of the FT gene.
