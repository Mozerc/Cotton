## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [FtPinG0201454200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FtGH1</u>
- **Gene Name:** glycosyl hydrolase 1
- **Genome:** [reference genome(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674205217302435?via%3Dihub#sec2)]()
- **Species:** *Fagopyrum tataricum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Multi-omics identification of a key glycosyl hydrolase gene **FtGH1** involved in rutin hydrolysis in Tartary buckwheat.
   - Identified a glycosyl hydrolase gene **FtGH1**, which could hydrolyse rutin to quercetin. 
   - For which substrate is catalysed by **FtGH1**, we performed an in vitro enzyme activity assay of **FtGH1**. The results showed that **FtGH1** was able to catalyse the generation of quercetin from rutin in vitro.
   - **FtGH1** is cell membrane localized and it functions at the cell membrane. For the four mutations in **FtGH1**, where the subcellular localization of F207A and S384A was not altered.
