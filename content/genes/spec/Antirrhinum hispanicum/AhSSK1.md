## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>AhSSK1</u>
- **Gene Name:** SLF-interacting SKP1-like protein 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Antirrhinum hispanicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **AhSSK1**, a novel SKP1-like protein that interacts with the S-locus F-box protein SLF.
   - Here, we report the identification of **AhSSK1**, Antirrhinum hispanicumSLF-interacting SKP1-like1, using a yeast two-hybrid screen against a pollen cDNA library.
   - **AhSSK1** is specifically expressed in pollen and has multiple transcripts as the result of alternative splicing and polyadenylation.
   - **AhSSK1**, despite having a similar secondary structure to other SKP1-like proteins, appeared quite distinctive in sequence and unique in a phylogenetic analysis, in which no SSK1 ortholog could be predicted in the sequenced genomes of Arabidopsis and rice.
