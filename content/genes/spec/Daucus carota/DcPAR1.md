- **Gene Name:** PHYTOCHROME RAPIDLY REGULATED1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Daucus carota*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Development and carotenoid synthesis in dark-grown carrot taproots require PHYTOCHROME RAPIDLY REGULATED1 (**DcPAR1**).
   - By means of RNA sequencing, in a previous analysis, we observed that carrot PHYTOCHROME RAPIDLY REGULATED1 (**DcPAR1**) is more highly expressed in the underground grown taproot compared with those grown in light.
   - The high expression of AtPAR1 and **DcPAR1** led us to hypothesize a functional role of **DcPAR1** that was verified through in vivo binding to AtPIF7 and overexpression in Arabidopsis, where AtPSY expression and carotenoid accumulation increased together with a photomorphogenic phenotype.
   - cPAR1 antisense carrot lines presented a dramatic decrease in carotenoid levels and in relative expression of key carotenogenic genes as well as impaired taproot development. These results suggest that **DcPAR1** is a key factor for secondary root development and carotenoid synthesis in carrot taproot grown underground.
