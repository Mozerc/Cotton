## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [DCAR_020269]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DcBCH1</u>
- **Gene Name:** non-heme carotene hydroxylase
- **Genome:** [carrot genome (https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3565)]()
- **Species:** *Daucus carota*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The relative expression level of **DcBCH1** was much higher than that of DcBCH2 in carrot taproots with different carotene accumulation levels.
   - Overexpression of **DcBCH1** in ‘KRD’ (high carotene accumulated) carrot changed the taproot color from orange to yellow, accompanied by substantial reductions in α-carotene and β-carotene.
   - **DcBCH1** played the main function of BCH enzyme, which could hydroxylate α-carotene and β-carotene.
   - **DcBCH1** and DcBCH2 had functional redundancy, and these two DcBCHs could partially compensate for each other.
