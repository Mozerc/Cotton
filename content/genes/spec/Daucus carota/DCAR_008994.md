## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [DCAR_008994]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DcMYB113</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [carrot genome (V2.0)]()
- **Species:** *Daucus carota*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DcMYB113**, a root-specific R2R3-MYB, conditions anthocyanin biosynthesis and modification in carrot.
   - **DcMYB113** could activate the expression of DcbHLH3 and structural genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis. DcUCGXT1 and DcSAT1, which were confirmed to be responsible for anthocyanins glycosylation and acylation, respectively, were also activated by **DcMYB113**.
   - The WGCNA identified several genes co-expressed with anthocyanin biosynthesis and the results indicated that **DcMYB113** may regulate anthocyanin transport.
   - These data suggest that **DcMYB113** mediates routes from Cy3G to the Cy3XSGG in the intricate anthocyanin modification pathways in carrot.
