## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [DCAR_014519]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DcBCH2</u>
- **Gene Name:** non-heme carotene hydroxylase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Daucus carota*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The relative expression level of DcBCH1 was much higher than that of **DcBCH2** in carrot taproots with different carotene accumulation levels.
   - There was no obvious change in taproot color between transgenic ‘KRD’ carrot overexpressing **DcBCH2** and control carrot.
   - Simultaneously, the content of α-carotene in the taproot of **DcBCH2**-overexpressing carrot decreased, but the content of β-carotene did not change significantly in comparison with control carrot.
   - DcBCH1 and **DcBCH2** had functional redundancy, and these two DcBCHs could partially compensate for each other.
