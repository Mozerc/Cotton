## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DcHSP17.7</u>
- **Gene Name:** heat shock protein17
- **Genome:** [P27396]()
- **Species:** *Daucus carota*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DcHSP17.7**, a small heat shock protein in carrot, is tissue-specifically expressed under salt stress and confers tolerance to salinity.
   - Native-PAGE analysis showed that **DcHSP17.7** was present in an approximately 250 kDa complex both before and after salt treatment. Salinity reduced bacterial cell viability| however, the transgenic E. coli expressing **DcHSP17.7** exhibited a higher survival rate than control E. coli under salt stress.
   - **DcHSP17.7** functioned as a molecular chaperone, increasing the level of soluble proteins. Taken together, **DcHSP17.7** appears to play an important role (or roles) in conferring tolerance to thermal stresses in plants.
   - This suggests that **DcHSP17.7** performs molecular chaperone activity in salt-stressed transgenic E. coli. Our results suggest that **DcHSP17.7** is likely to be involved in tolerance not only to thermal stresses but also to other abiotic stresses, such as salinity.
   - We have examined the ability of a carrot (Daucus carota L.) heat shock protein gene encoding HSP17.7 (**DcHSP17.7**) to confer enhanced heat tolerance to potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), a cool-season crop.
