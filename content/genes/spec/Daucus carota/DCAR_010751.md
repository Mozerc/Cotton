## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [DCAR_010751]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DcMYB11</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3 MYB 11
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Daucus carota*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Report on the discovery of DNA structural differences affecting the activity of an R2R3 MYB (encoded by **DcMYB11**) involved in anthocyanin regulation in carrot petiole.
   - To this end, we first verified the function of **DcMYB11** using heterologous systems and identified three different alleles which may explain differences in petiole pigmentation.
   - Functional characterization of **DcMYB11**, an R2R3 MYB associated with the purple pigmentation of carrot petiole.
   - **DcMYB11**, an R2R3 MYB gene associated with petiole anthocyanin pigmentation in carrot, was functionally characterized. A putative enhancer sequence is able to increase **DcMYB11** activity.
