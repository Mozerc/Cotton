## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NbALY916</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana benthamiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **NbALY916** is involved in potato virus X P25-triggered cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana.
   - **NbALY916** expression was reduced by tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based virus-induced gene silencing, the accumulation of P25 was increased, which would be expected to cause more severe necrosis. 
   - Overexpression of **NbALY916** increased the accumulation of H2O2 and triggered more extensive cell death when coexpressed with P25, even though accumulation of P25 was itself reduced by the increased expression of **NbALY916**.
   - Our results reveal that **NbALY916** has an antiviral role that, in the case of PVX, operates by inducing the accumulation of H2O2 and mediating the degradation of P25.
