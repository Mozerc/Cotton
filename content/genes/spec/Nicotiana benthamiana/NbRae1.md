## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NbRae1</u>
- **Gene Name:** RNA export 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana benthamiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Virus-induced gene silencing of Nicotiana benthamiana Rae1, **NbRae1**, which encodes a protein with four WD40 repeats, resulted in growth arrest and abnormal leaf development. 
   - **NbRae1** was mainly associated with the nuclear envelope during interphase, and **NbRae1** deficiency caused accumulation of poly(A) RNA in the nuclei of leaf cells, suggesting defective mRNA export. 
   - Differentiated leaf cells of **NbRae1**-silenced plants exhibited elevated ploidy levels. Immunolabeling in BY-2 cells showed that **NbRae1** protein localized to mitotic microtubules and the cell plate-forming zone during mitosis, and recombinant **NbRae1** directly bound to microtubules in vitro.
   - Inhibition of **NbRae1** expression in BY-2 cells using a Î²-estradiol-inducible RNAi system resulted in severe defects in spindle organization and chromosome alignment and segregation, which correlated with delays in cell cycle progression.
   - Together, these results suggest that **NbRae1** plays a dual role in mRNA export in interphase and in spindle assembly in mitosis.
