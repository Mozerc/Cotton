## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhUGT78A22</u>
- **Gene Name:** UDP-glycosyltransferase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Paeonia hybrid*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PhUGT78A22**, a novel glycosyltransferase in Paeonia ‘He Xie’, can catalyze the transfer of glucose to glucosylated anthocyanins during petal blotch formation.
   - Silencing of **PhUGT78A22** reduced the content of anthocyanidin 3,5-O-diglucoside in P. ‘He Xie’.
   - A UDP-glycosyltransferase, **PhUGT78A22**, was identified in P. ‘He Xie’, and the molecular mechanism underlying differential distribution of anthocyanins within petals was elucidated.
