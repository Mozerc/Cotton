## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LjCYC2</u>
- **Gene Name:** CYCLOIDEA2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lotus japonicus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - LjCYC Genes Constitute Floral Dorsoventral Asymmetry in Lotus japonicus.
   - The expression of three endogenous LjCYC genes was specifically suppressed by different specific RNAi transgenes, and a chimerical RNAi transgene that contains the specific sequences from LjCYC1 and **LjCYC2** was found to downregulate the expression of both endogenous genes simultaneously.
   - Demonstrating the dorsalizing activity of LjCYC1/2 and lateralizing one of LjCYC3. By downregulating the expression of three LjCYC genes, complete loss of DV differentiation in the transgenic flower could be identified and all petals resembled the ventral one in the wild type, which possessed the intact IN asymmetry.
   - Our data demonstrate that during zygomorphic flower development, the DV asymmetry is constituted by the LjCYC genes, while the floral organ IN asymmetry is independently determined by other genetic factors.
