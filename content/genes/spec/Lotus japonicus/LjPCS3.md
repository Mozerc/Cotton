## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LjPCS3</u>
- **Gene Name:** phytochelatin synthase PCS3-7N
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lotus japonicus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional Characterization of an Unusual Phytochelatin Synthase, **LjPCS3**, of Lotus japonicus.
   - Our results showed that lead was the best activator of LjPCS1 in the in vitro assay, whereas, for both assays, arsenic, iron, and aluminum were better activators of **LjPCS3** and mercury was similarly active with the two enzymes.
   - We have found that budding yeast cells expressing LjPCS1 or **LjPCS3** show increased in vivo tolerance to Cd.
   - We conclude that the in vivo and in vitro assays are useful and complementary to assess the response of LjPCS1 and **LjPCS3** to a wide range of metals and that the differences in the C-terminal domains of the two proteins are responsible for their distinct expression levels or stabilities in heterologous systems and patterns of metal activation.
