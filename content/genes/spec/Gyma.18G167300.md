## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gyma.18G167300]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmFATA1</u>
- **Gene Name:** acyl–acyl carrier protein thioesterase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The acyl–acyl carrier protein thioesterases **GmFATA1** and GmFATA2 are essential for fatty acid accumulation and growth in soybean.
   - Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing mutation of **GmFATA1** or 2 led to reduced leaf FA content and growth defect at the early seedling stage.
   - Combined transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis revealed a large number of genes involved in FA synthesis and FA chain elongation are expressed at reduced level in the **GmFATA1** mutant, accompanied by a lower triacylglycerol abundance at the early seedling stage.
   - Overexpression of GmFATA in soybean led to significant increases in leaf FA content by 5.7%, vegetative growth, and seed yield by 26.9%, and seed FA content by 23.2%. Thus, overexpression of GmFATA is an effective strategy to enhance soybean oil content and yield.
