## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbWoxT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** WUSCHEL-RELATEDHOMEOBOX WOX
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus betulifolia*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PbWoxT1** mRNA from pear (Pyrus betulaefolia) undergoes long-distance transport assisted by a polypyrimidine tract binding protein.
   - A 548-bp fragment of **PbWoxT1** is critical in long-distance transport. **PbWoxT1** is rich in CUCU polypyrimidine domains and its mRNAs interact with a polypyrimidine tract binding protein, PbPTB3.
   - The expression of **PbWoxT1** significantly increased in the stems of wild-type (WT) tobacco grafted onto the rootstocks of **PbWoxT1** or PbPTB3 co-overexpressing lines, but this was not the case in WT plants grafted onto **PbWoxT1** overexpressing rootstocks, suggesting that PbPTB3 mediates **PbWoxT1** mRNA long-distance transport.
   - These grafting experiments revealed a role for the PbPTB3 protein in assisting long-distance transport of **PbWoxT1** mRNA, the mechanism of which is discussed.
