## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PutHKT2|1</u>
- **Gene Name:** high-affinity K+ transporter
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Puccinellia tenuiflora*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A high-affinity K+transporter **PutHKT2|1**|**PutHKT2|1** cDNA was isolated from the salt-tolerant plant Puccinellia tenuiflora. Expression of **PutHKT2|1**|**PutHKT2|1** was induced by both 300 mM NaCl and K+-starvation stress in roots, but only slightly regulated by those stresses in shoots.
   - **PutHKT2|1**|**PutHKT2|1** transcript levels in 300 mM NaCl were doubled by the depletion of potassium. Yeast transformed with **PutHKT2|1**|**PutHKT2|1**, like those transformed with PhaHKT2|**PutHKT2|1** from salt-tolerant reed plants (Phragmites australis), (i) were able to take up K+ in low K+ concentration medium or in the presence of NaCl, and (ii) were permeable to Na+.
   - This suggests that **PutHKT2|1**|**PutHKT2|1** has a high affinity K+-Na+ symport function in yeast. Arabidopsis over-expressing **PutHKT2|1**|**PutHKT2|1** showed increased sensitivities to Na+, K+, and Li+, while Arabidopsis over-expressing OsHKT2|**PutHKT2|1** from rice (Oryza sativa) showed increased sensitivity only to Na+.
   - These findings demonstrate that the functional activity of PutHKT**PutHKT2|1**|5 and PutSOS**PutHKT2|1** in P. tenuiflora roots is fine-tuned under saline conditions as well as by operation of other ion transporters/channel (PutHKT**PutHKT2|1**|4, **PutHKT2|1**|**PutHKT2|1**, and PutAKT**PutHKT2|1**).
   - These results show that the modes of action of **PutHKT2|1**|**PutHKT2|1** in transgenic yeast and Arabidopsis differ from the mode of action of the closely related OsHKT2|**PutHKT2|1** transporter.
