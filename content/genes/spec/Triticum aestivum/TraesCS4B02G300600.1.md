## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS4B02G300600.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaNramp5-b</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Se use significantly decreased the expression of TaNramp5-a and **TaNramp5-b** in shoot at low Cd stress levels, indicating that Se might inhibit the remobilization of Cd in shoot.
   - Se treatment significantly decreased the expression of TaNramp5-a and **TaNramp5-b** in root, indicating that the downregulation of TaNramp5-a and **TaNramp5-b** by Se may help to decrease Cd uptake in wheat.
   - The results confirm that Se application limits Cd accumulation in wheat by regulating the subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cd in winter wheat tissues, as well as the expression of TaNramp5-a, **TaNramp5-b** and TaHMA2 in root.
   - The downregulation of TaNramp5-a and **TaNramp5-b** decreased Cd uptake by wheat root and then decreased the Cd content in wheat. The downregulation of TaHMA2 and the proportion of active Cd in root reduced the migration of Cd to shoot and the distribution of Cd in shoot.
