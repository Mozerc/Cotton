## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS1D03G0330200 ]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaSINA1D</u>
- **Gene Name:** SINA-type E3 Ub ligase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaSINA1D**-OE transgenic wheat lines showed similar drought tolerance and root growth phenotype to those observed when TaSINA2B was overexpressed.
   - Found that TaSINA2B interacted with **TaSINA1D**, whereby these two genes jointly enhanced root growth, thus positively regulating wheat responses to drought stress.
   - Therefore, the variation of TaSINA2B promoter contributed to the drought stress regulation, while TaSINA2B, interacting with **TaSINA1D**, positively regulated drought tolerance by promoting root growth.
   - The effects of drought stress on **TaSINA1D** OE plants were similar to those on TaSINA2B OE plants. Therefore, we concluded that TaSINA2B may interact with **TaSINA1D** to regulate root growth, thereby enhancing drought tolerance.
