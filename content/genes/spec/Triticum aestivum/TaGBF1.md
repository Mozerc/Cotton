## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaGBF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The wheat **TaGBF1** gene is involved in the blue-light response and salt tolerance.
   - **TaGBF1** was inducible by blue light, salt and exposure to abscisic acid (ABA). **TaGBF1** interacted with a Gâ€“box light-responsive element in vitro and promoted a blue-light response in wheat and Aradidopsis thaliana.
   - Both **TaGBF1** over-expression in wheat and its heterologous expression in A. thaliana heighten sensitivity to salinity and ABA, but its knockdown in wheat conferred resistance to high salinity and ABA. The expression of AtABI5, a key component of the ABA signaling pathway in A. thaliana, and its homolog Wabi5 in wheat was increased by transgenic expression of **TaGBF1**.
   - The hypersensitivity to salt and ABA caused by **TaGBF1** was not observed in the abi5 mutant background, showing that ABI5 is the mediator in **TaGBF1**-induced abiotic stress responses.
   - **TaGBF1** enhances the blue-light response in wheat and Arabidopsis seedlings.
