## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS2A02G297500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Ta2CP</u>
- **Gene Name:** 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Both **Ta2CP** silencing and overexpression inferred the involvement of **Ta2CP** in plant growth and chlorophyll biosynthesis.
   - We demonstrated that **Ta2CP** interacts with protochlorophyllide reductase b, TaPORB. Reduced TaPORB expression was found in **Ta2CP**-silenced plants, while upregulation was observed in **Ta2CP**-overexpressed plants.
   - The downregulation of **Ta2CP** in Taporb-silenced plants and reduction of protochlorophyllide in **Ta2CP**-silenced plants suggested the key role of **Ta2CP** in chlorophyll metabolism.
   - The transcript levels of AGPase1 and starch were increased in **Ta2CP**-silenced plants. More significantly, HTS-treated **Ta2CP**-silenced plants showed adaptive responses despite increased reactive oxygen species and peroxide concentrations, which might help in rapid induction of high-temperature acclimation.
