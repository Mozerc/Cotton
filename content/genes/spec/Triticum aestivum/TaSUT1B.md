## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaSUT1B</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose transporter1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - TaSUT1A, 1B, and 1D, were expressed in germinating seeds, where their function is unknown. All three TaSUT1 proteins were confirmed to be capable of transporting both Suc and maltose by complementation tests with the SUSY7/ura3 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant strain.
   - TaSUT1 transcript and SUT protein were detected in cells of the aleurone layer, scutellar epidermis, scutellar ground cells, and sieve element-companion cell complexes located in the scutellum, shoot, and root.
   - It is proposed that loading the scutellar phloem in germinating wheat seeds can proceed by symplasmic and apoplasmic pathways, the latter facilitated by SUT activity.
   - SUTs may function to transport Suc into the scutellum from the endosperm early in germination and later transport maltose.
