## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS5B02G257300.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaGSNE</u>
- **Gene Name:** Grain Size and Number Enhancer
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaGSNE**, a WRKY transcription factor, overcomes the trade-off between grain size and grain number in common wheat and is associated with root development.
   - In this study, we identify the WRKY gene **TaGSNE** (Grain Size and Number Enhancer) in common wheat, and find that it has relatively high expression in leaves and roots, and is induced by multiple abiotic stresses.
   - Furthermore, transgenic rice lines overexpressing **TaGSNE** had larger panicles, more grains, increased grain size, and increased grain yield relative to the wild-type control
   - Our findings demonstrate that **TaGSNE** overcomes the trade-off between TGW/grain size and grain number, leading us to conclude that these elite haplotypes and their functional markers could be utilized in marker-assisted selection for breeding high-yielding varieties.
