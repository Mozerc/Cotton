## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaHOS15-B</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Wheat WD40-repeat protein TaHOS15 functions in a histone deacetylase complex to fine-tune defense responses to Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici.
   - TaHOS15, encoding a WDR protein, from the Bgt-susceptible wheat cultivar Jing411 and demonstrated that knockdown of TaHOS15 expression using virus- or transient-induced gene-silencing attenuated wheat susceptibility to Bgt.
   - We determined the role of TaHOS15, which might act as an adaptor protein recruiting TaHDA6 to the chromatin of wheat defense-related genes including TaPR1, TaPR2, TaPR5, and TaWRKY45, where they repress histone acetylation. 
   - Reduced TaHOS15 or TaHDA6 transcript levels led to decreased susceptibility to Bgt together with enhanced defense-related transcription under Bgt infection.
   - TaHOS15 functions in a histone deacetylase complex with TaHDA6 to fine-tune the defense response to Bgt in common wheat.
