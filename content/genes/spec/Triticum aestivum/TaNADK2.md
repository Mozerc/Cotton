## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaNADK2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Subsequent investigations revealed that Pst03724 interferes with the TaCaM3-2B–NAD kinase (NADK) **TaNADK2** association and thus inhibits the enzyme activity of **TaNADK2** activated by TaCaM3-2B. Knocking down **TaNADK2** expression by virus-mediated gene silencing significantly increased fungal growth and development, suggesting a decrease in resistance against Pst infection.
   - In conclusion, our findings indicate that Pst effector Pst03724 inhibits the activity of NADK by interfering with the TaCaM3-2B–**TaNADK2** association, thereby facilitating Pst infection.
   - **TaNADK2** was also proved to be a positive factor of wheat resistance.
