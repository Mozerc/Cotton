## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaSK1A</u>
- **Gene Name:** SHAGGY-like kinase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We report the identification and structural characterization of two GSK homologs named TaSK1 and TaSK2 in the hexaploid wheat genome as well as a widespread phylogenetic analysis of land plant GSKs.
   - In vitro kinase assays showed that TaSK1 and TaSK2 possessed kinase activity. A phylogenetic analysis of land plant GSKs indicated that TaSK1 and TaSK2 belong to clade II of plant GSKs, the Arabidopsis members of which are all involved in Brassinosteroid signaling.
   - These data strengthen the results of the sequence alignment analysis and provided strong evidence that the three TaSK1 copies on one hand and the three TaSK2 copies on the other hand were homoeolog gene copies.
   - In this article, we report the molecular characterization of two homolog wheat GSKs called TaSK1 and 2 (Triticum aestivum Shaggy like Kinase 1 and 2) as well as their homoeologous gene copies.
