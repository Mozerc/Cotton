## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaMPK6</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Wheat Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases TaMPK3 and **TaMPK6** Are Differentially Regulated at Multiple Levels during Compatible Disease Interactions with Mycosphaerella graminicola.
   - It will be interesting to identify the MKK responsible for activating TaMPK3 during the compatible disease interaction. It will also be interesting to test whether the same MKK can act on **TaMPK6** when this kinase is activated in wheat leaves following direct infiltration with H2O2
   - The differences in protein levels between **TaMPK6** and TaMPK3 throughout the course of the compatible interaction in the M. graminicola-wheat pathosystem also has implications for the upstream activators of the cascade(s).
