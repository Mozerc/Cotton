## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaHMA2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Se treatment significantly decreased the expression of **TaHMA2** in root, indicating that the downregulation of **TaHMA2** by Se might contribute to the inhibition of Cd root-to-shoot translocation and the final decrease in Cd accumulation in the shoot of winter wheat.
   - The downregulation of **TaHMA2** and the proportion of active Cd in root reduced the migration of Cd to shoot and the distribution of Cd in shoot.
   - Our results showed that TaNramp5, TaHMA3 and **TaHMA2** might be responsible for the uptake and transport of Cd in wheat plants.
   - The results confirm that Se application limits Cd accumulation in wheat by regulating the subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cd in winter wheat tissues, as well as the expression of TaNramp5-a, TaNramp5-b and **TaHMA2** in root.
