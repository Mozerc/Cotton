## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaNPSN11</u>
- **Gene Name:** soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor 11
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cloned and characterized three NPSN genes (**TaNPSN11**, TaNPSN12, and TaNPSN13) and three plant defence-related SNARE homologues (TaSYP132, TaSNAP34, and TaMEMB12).
   - In virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assays, resistance of wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar Xingzi9104 to the Pst avirulent race CYR23 was reduced by knocking down **TaNPSN11**, TaNPSN13 and TaSYP132, but not TaNPSN12, implying diversified functions of these wheat SNARE homologues in prevention of Pst infection and hyphal elongation.
   - Immuno-localization results showed that **TaNPSN11** or its structural homologues were mainly distributed in vesicle structures near cell membrane toward Pst hypha.
   - Taken together, our data suggests a role of **TaNPSN11** in vesicle-mediated resistance to stripe rust.
