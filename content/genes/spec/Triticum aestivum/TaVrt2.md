## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaVrt2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Vegetative to reproductive transition 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaVrt2**, an SVP-like gene, cooperates with TaVrn1 to regulate vernalization-induced flowering in wheat.
   - **TaVrt2** and TaVrn1 are flowering promoters in the vernalization pathway and interact physically in vitro, in planta and in wheat cells.
   - **TaVrt2** and TaVrn1 were significantly induced in leaves by vernalization, suggesting their spatio-temporal interaction during vernalization.
   - A **TaVrt2**-mediated positive feedback loop of TaVrn1 during vernalization was proposed, providing additional understanding on the regulatory mechanism underlying vernalization-induced flowering.
