## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCPK7-D</u>
- **Gene Name:** cultivar CI 12633 calcium-dependent protein kinase7-D
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The wheat calcium-dependent protein kinase **TaCPK7-D** positively regulates host resistance to sharp eyespot disease.
   - **TaCPK7-D**, encoding a subgroup III member of the calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) family, was identified from the sharp eyespot-resistant wheat line CI12633 through comparative transcriptomic analysis. 
   - Subsequently, the defence role of **TaCPK7-D** against R. cerealis infection was studied by the generation and characterization of **TaCPK7-D**-silenced and **TaCPK7-D**-overexpressing wheat plants.
   - **TaCPK7-D**-overexpressing wheat lines showed increased resistance to sharp eyespot compared with untransformed recipient wheat Yangmai 16.
   - These results suggest that **TaCPK7-D** positively regulates the wheat resistance response to R. cerealis infection through the modulation of the expression of these defence-associated genes, and that **TaCPK7-D** is a candidate to improve sharp eyespot resistance in wheat.
