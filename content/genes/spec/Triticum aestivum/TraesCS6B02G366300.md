## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS6B02G366300]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaBG1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ectopic expression of **TaBG1** increases seed size and alters nutritional characteristics of the grain in wheat but does not lead to increased yields.
   - It was found that increased **TaBG1**-A expression could indeed lead to larger seed size but was linked to a reduction in seed number per plant leading to no significant overall increase in yield.
   - **TaBG1** does control seed size in wheat but increasing the seed size per se does not increase yield and may come at the cost of lower concentrations of essential elements as well as potentially lower protein content.
   - **TaBG1** could be a useful target for further breeding efforts in combination with other genes for increased biomass.
