## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaABCC3.2</u>
- **Gene Name:** ABC transporter C family member 3 protein 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two variants of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family C transporter gene were cloned from DON-treated wheat mRNA, namely TaABCC3.1 and **TaABCC3.2**. These represent two of three putative genes identified on chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D of the wheat genome sequence.
   - Silencing by both VIGS constructs enhanced head ripening, and especially so in DON-treated heads. VIGS of TaABCC3 genes also reduced the grain number by more than 28% (P<0.05), both with and without DON treatment, and the effects were greater for the construct that targeted the two homeologues.
   - Hence, DON-responsive TaABCC3 genes warrant further study to determine their potential as disease resistance breeding targets and their function in grain formation and ripening.
   - Phylogenetic and predictive model analyses of these genes has increased our understanding of wheat ABC transporters, and modelling suggested that TaABCC3.1 and its homologue **TaABCC3.2** encode ABC exporters that differ in the N-terminal transmembrane domain 0 (TMD0).
