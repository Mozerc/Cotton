## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS3D02G517100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaASR-3D</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Pst21674 interaction with the abscisic acid-, stress-, and ripening-induced protein TaASR3 was validated mainly in the nucleus. Size exclusion chromatography, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and luciferase complementation imaging assays confirmed that TaASR3 could form a functional tetramer.
   - Virus-induced gene silencing and overexpression demonstrated that TaASR3 contributes to wheat resistance to stripe rust by promoting accumulation of reactive oxygen species and cell death.
   - Additionally, transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of defense-related genes was regulated in transgenic wheat plants overexpressing TaASR3. Interaction between Pst21674 and TaASR3 interfered with the polymerization of TaASR3 and suppressed TaASR3-mediated transcriptional activation of defense-related genes.
   - These results indicate that Pst21674 serves as an important virulence factor secreted into the host nucleus to impede wheat resistance to Pst, possibly by targeting and preventing polymerization of TaASR3.
