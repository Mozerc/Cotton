- **Gene Name:** GCN2-type PCR product

- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of GCN2-type protein kinase (**TaGCN2**) in wheat has profound effects on free amino acid concentration and gene expression.
   - GCN2-type PCR product (**TaGCN2**) was amplified from wheat (Triticum aestivum) RNA, while a wheat eIF2Î± homologue was identified in wheat genome data and found to contain a conserved target site for phosphorylation by GCN2.
   - **TaGCN2** overexpression in transgenic wheat resulted in significant decreases in total free amino acid concentration in the grain, with free asparagine concentration in particular being much lower than in controls.
   - The study demonstrates that **TaGCN2** plays an important role in the regulation of genes encoding enzymes of amino acid biosynthesis in wheat and is the first to implicate GCN2-type protein kinases so clearly in sulphur signalling in any organism.
   - It shows that manipulation of **TaGCN2** gene expression could be used to reduce free asparagine accumulation in wheat grain and the risk of acrylamide formation in wheat products.
