## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaSAP1-A1</u>
- **Gene Name:** A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Polymorphism of **TaSAP1-A1** and its association with agronomic traits in wheat.
   - **TaSAP1-A1**, a TaSAP1 member on chromosome 7A, and its flanking sequences were isolated. Polymorphism analysis indicated that the average nucleotide diversity (Ï€) of the whole region was 0.00296.
   - **TaSAP1-A1** was significantly associated with 1,000-grain weight, number of grains per spike, spike length, peduncle length and total number of spikelets per spike in multiple environments.
   - It is likely that **TaSAP1-A1** is related to, or is in LD with such yield-related QTL.
