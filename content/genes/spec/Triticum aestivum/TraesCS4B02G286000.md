## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS4B02G286000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaMTL-4B</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - TaWaxy and TaMTL, were edited with high efficiency by the optimized SpCas9 system, with the highest efficiency (80.5%) being achieved when using TaU3 and two sgRNAs to target TaWaxy.
   - A haploid induction rate of 18.9% was found in the TaMTL-edited T1 plants using the CRISPR/SpCas9 system. Mutants with reverse insertion of the deleted sequences of TaMTL and TaWaxy between the two sgRNAs were identified in the edited T0 plants.
   - In addition, wheat grains lacking embryos or endosperms were observed in the TaMTL-edited T1 generation.
   - We then applied the optimized system to edit TaMTL and TaWaxy to develop the induction of haploids and to improve starch quality.
