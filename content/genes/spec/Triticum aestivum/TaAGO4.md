## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaAGO4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Argonaute4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two putative wheat Argonaute genes, TaAGO1b and **TaAGO4**, were cloned. Phylogenetic analysis, prediction of conserved domains and catalytic motifs, and modelling of their protein structures suggested that they encode functional Argonaute proteins.
   - Expression analysis via Semi RT-PCR demonstrated that both TaAGO1b and **TaAGO4** were highly expressed in all examined tissues, including the root, stem, leaf, anther, ovule, and mature seed, as well as in developing wheat kernels.
   - These results indicated that both genes (TaAGO1b and **TaAGO4**) have important roles within the vernalization response, but their functioning might involve different regulatory mechanisms.
