## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaERD15</u>
- **Gene Name:** early responsive to dehydration 15
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Wheat TaSnRK2.10 phosphorylates **TaERD15** and TaENO1 and confers drought tolerance when overexpressed in rice.
   - **TaERD15** phosphorylated by TaSnRK2.10 was prone to degradation by the 26S proteasome, thereby mitigating its negative effects on drought tolerance.
   - **TaERD15** is a member of the dehydrin family involved in the response to drought stress, and a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis AtERD15 which has been reported previously.
   - Overexpression of **TaERD15** results in hypersensitivity to drought stress.
