## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS5A02G391400]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaSPO11-1-5A</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Bread wheat TaSPO11-1 exhibits evolutionarily conserved function in meiotic recombination across distant plant species.
   - Although the wheat and Arabidopsis SPO11-1 proteins share only 55% identity and the partner proteins also differ, the TaSPO11-1-5D cDNA significantly restored the fertility of the Arabidopsis spo11-1 mutant, indicating a robust functional conservation of the SPO11-1 protein activity across distant plants.
   - This excludes the possibility that TaSPO11-1 induces DSBs independently of SPO11-2 (non-plant organisms have a single SPO11 protein), and confirms the need for the MTOPVIB to form DSBs.
   - We extend these comparisons in demonstrating the functionality and evolutionary conservation of wheat TaSPO11-1 through heterologous complementation of the corresponding Arabidopsis and rice mutant lines, i.e. across distant plant species.
