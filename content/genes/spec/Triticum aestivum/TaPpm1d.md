## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaPpm1d</u>
- **Gene Name:** purple pericarp-MYB 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two transcription factors TaPpm1 and TaPpb1 co-regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple pericarps of wheat.
   - Three non-functional variants were detected in the coding sequence of TaPpm1 from non-purple seed lines, in which the function of TaPpm1 was destroyed either by insertion-induced frame shifts or truncated peptides.
   - We were able to demonstrate that the interaction of TaPpm1 and TaPpb1 co-regulates the synthesis of anthocyanin.
   - These results indicated that TaPpm1 and TaPpb1 are complementary genes that control downstream genes and subsequent purple pigment synthesis in wheat grains.
   - TaPpm1 and TaPpb1 collaboratively regulate the purple pericarp phenotype of wheat.
