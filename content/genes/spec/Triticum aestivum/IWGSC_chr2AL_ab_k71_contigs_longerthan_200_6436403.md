## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [IWGSC_chr2AL_ab_k71_contigs_longerthan_200_6436403]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaFlo2-A1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Floury endosperm2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaFlo2-A1**, an ortholog of rice Flo2, is associated with thousand grain weight in bread wheat.
   - The expression level of **TaFlo2-A1** in developing grains at 5 DAF (days after flowering) was positively correlated with TGW in cultivars carrying the positive haplotype.
   - These results suggested that the relative expression level of **TaFlo2-A1** was highest in flag leaves but started to decrease in developing grains.
   - This is mainly because the effect of **TaFlo2-A1** is likely masked by other genes associated with grain size.
