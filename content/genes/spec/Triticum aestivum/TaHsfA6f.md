## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaHsfA6f</u>
- **Gene Name:** Heat shock factor A6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaHsfA6f** is a transcriptional activator that regulates a suite of heat stress protection genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) including previously unknown Hsf targets.
   - Expression analysis showed that **TaHsfA6f** was expressed constitutively in green organs but was markedly up-regulated during heat stress.
   - Overexpression of **TaHsfA6f** in transgenic wheat using a drought-inducible promoter resulted in up-regulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and a number of other heat stress protection genes that included some previously unknown Hsf target genes such as Golgi anti-apoptotic protein (GAAP) and the large isoform of Rubisco activase.
   - These data suggest that **TaHsfA6f** is a transcriptional activator that directly regulates TaHSP, TaGAAP, and TaRof1 genes in wheat and its gene regulatory network has a positive impact on thermotolerance.
