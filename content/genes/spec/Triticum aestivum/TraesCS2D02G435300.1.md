## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS2D02G435300.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCOLD1-2D</u>
- **Gene Name:** GPCR-type G protein COLD1-like
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - TaCOLD1 defines a new regulator of plant height in bread wheat.
   - We identify a light-regulated gene from bread wheat, designated as TaCOLD1, whose encoding protein is homologous to cold sensor COLD1 in rice.
   - TaCOLD1 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane. Phenotypic analyses show that overexpression of a mutated form of TaCOLD1 (M187K) in bread wheat cultivar Kenong199 (Rht-B1b) background resulted in an obvious reduction in plant height.
   - TaCOLD1 acts as a novel regulator of plant height through interfering with the formation of heterotrimeric G protein complex in bread wheat and is a valuable target for the engineering of wheat plant architecture.
