## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaFAd</u>
- **Gene Name:** mitochondrial ATP synthase precursor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of the nuclear gene **TaFAd** is under mitochondrial retrograde regulation in anthers of male sterile wheat plants with timopheevii cytoplasm.
   - the full cDNA of the gene **TaFAd** that encodes the putative FAd subunit of the FoF1-ATP synthase was isolated from the wheat (Triticum aestivum) fertility restorer ‘2114’ for timopheevii cytoplasm-based CMS.
   - **TaFAd** is a single copy gene in wheat and maps to the short arm of the group 6 chromosomes. Transient expression of the **TaFAd**–GFP fusion in onion epidermal cells demonstrated **TaFAd**'s mitochondrial location. **TaFAd** was expressed abundantly in stem, leaf, anther, and ovary tissues of 2114.
   - These observations implied that **TaFAd** is under mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the anthers of CMS plants with timopheevii cytoplasm.
