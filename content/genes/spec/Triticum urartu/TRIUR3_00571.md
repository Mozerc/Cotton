## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TRIUR3_00571]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TubZIP28</u>
- **Gene Name:** Basic Leucine Zipper 28
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum urartu*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, a novel basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family transcription factor **TubZIP28** was found to be preferentially expressed in the endosperm throughout grain-filling stages in Triticum urartu, the A genome donor of common wheat.
   - When **TubZIP28** was overexpressed in common wheat, the total starch content increased by c. 4%, which contributed to c. 5% increase in the thousand kernel weight. 
   - **TubZIP28** is preferentially expressed in developing endosperms of T. urartu during grain-filling stages.
   - Both in vitro and in vivo assays showed that **TubZIP28** bound to the promoter of cytosolic AGPase and enhanced both the transcription and activity of the latter.
   - **TubZIP28** and TabZIP28 are transcriptional activators of starch synthesis first identified in wheat, and they could be superior targets to improve the starch content and yield potential of wheat.
