## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Potri.002G260000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PtrRAD1</u>
- **Gene Name:** RADIALIS
- **Genome:** [Phytozome: Populus trichocarpa v3.0]()
- **Species:** *Populus trichocarpa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In addition to interacting with poplar homologs of RADIALIS (**PtrRAD1**) and DIVARICATA (PtrDIV4), PtrDRIF1 interacted with members of other families within the homeodomain-like superfamily, including PtrWOX13c, a WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX protein, and PtrKNAT7, a KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX protein.
   - **PtrRAD1** and PtrDIV4 interacted with the MYB/SANT-containing N-terminal portion of PtrDRIF1, whereas DUF3755 was both necessary and sufficient for interactions with PtrWOX13c and PtrKNAT7.
   - **PtrRAD1** has the potential to mediate the availability of PtrDRIF1 not only for interactions with PtrDIV proteins, as reported for homologous snapdragon proteins, but also for interactions with PtrWOX13c and PtrKNAT7.
   - Suggests that **PtrRAD1** has the potential to mediate the availability of PtrDRIF1 not only for interactions with PtrDIV proteins, as reported for homologous snapdragon proteins, but also for interactions with PtrWOX13c and PtrKNAT7.
