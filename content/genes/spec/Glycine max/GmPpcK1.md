## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmPpcK1</u>
- **Gene Name:** phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxylase kinase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Although the **GmPpcK1**–4 transcripts are all expressed throughout nodule development, only the nearly identical GmPpcK2/3 homologs are nodule-enhanced and up-/down-regulated in vivo by photosynthate supply from the shoots.
   - In situ RT–PCR investigation of the spatial localization of the **GmPpcK1**–4 and GmPpc7 transcripts in mature nodules is entirely consistent with this view.
   - Complementary histochemical and related RNA gel-blot findings with nodulated, **GmPpcK1**/3 promoter::GUS-expressing T2 plants provide direct experimental evidence that (i) PpcK gene expression is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level| and (ii) the contrasting expression properties of **GmPpcK1**/3 are conferred largely by regulatory element(s) within the approximately 1.4-kb 5′-upstream region.
   - As a result of our multifaceted analyses of **GmPpcK1**–4, GmPpc7 and PEPC-phosphorylation in the soybean nodule, it is proposed that the GmPpcK2/3 homologs and GmPpc7 together comprise the key molecular ‘downstream players’ in this regulatory phosphorylation system within the mature nodule's central zone.
