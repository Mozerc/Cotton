## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.18G258000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmMaT2</u>
- **Gene Name:** malonyl-CoA acyltransferase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Isoflavone malonyl-CoA acyltransferase **GmMaT2** is involved in nodulation of soybean by modifying synthesis and secretion of isoflavones.
   - **GmMaT2** and GmMaT4 recombinant enzymes used isoflavone 7-O-glucosides as acceptors and malonyl-CoA as an acyl donor to generate isoflavone glucoside malonates.
   - Only **GmMaT2** knockdown (KD) hairy roots showed reduced levels of malonyldaidzin, malonylgenistin, and malonylglycitin, and, likewise, reduced nodule numbers.
   - **GmMaT2** participates in soybean nodulation by catalyzing isoflavone malonylation and affecting malonyl isoflavone secretion for activation of Nod factor and nodulation.
