## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [glyma.17g053300]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmDGAT1b</u>
- **Gene Name:** Diacylglycerol acyltransferase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   -  We previously identified a soybean DGAT1b variant modified with 14 amino acid substitutions (**GmDGAT1b**-MOD) that increases total oil content by 3 percentage points when overexpressed in soybean seeds.
   - In the present study, additional **GmDGAT1b** variants were generated to further increase oil with a reduced number of substitutions. Variants with one to four amino acid substitutions were screened in the model systems Saccharomyces cerevisiae and transient Nicotiana benthamiana leaf.
   - One **GmDGAT1b** variant with three novel amino acid substitutions (**GmDGAT1b**-3aa) increased total soybean oil to levels near the previously discovered **GmDGAT1b**-MOD variant. In a multiple location field trial, **GmDGAT1b**-3aa transgenic events had significantly increased oil and protein by up to 2.3 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively.
   - The modeling of the **GmDGAT1b**-3aa protein structure provided insights into the potential function of the three substitutions. These findings will guide efforts to improve soybean oil content and overall seed composition by CRISPR editing.
