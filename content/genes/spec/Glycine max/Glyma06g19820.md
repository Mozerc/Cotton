## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma06g19820]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmAMADH2</u>
- **Gene Name:** amino aldehyde dehydrogenase2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Deficiency in the amino aldehyde dehydrogenase encoded by **GmAMADH2**, the homologue of rice Os2AP, enhances 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline biosynthesis in soybeans.
   - This variation caused a frame-shift mutation and a premature stop codon. Suppression of **GmAMADH2** by introduction of a **GmAMADH2**-RNAi construct into the calli of the two nonaromatic wild-type varieties inhibited the synthesis of AMADH and induced the biosynthesis of 2AP.
   - **GmAMADH2** is the key gene responsible for 2AP biosynthesis in soybeans.
   - These results suggest that deficiency in the **GmAMADH2** product, AMADH, plays a similar role in soybean as in rice, which is to promote 2AP biosynthesis. This phenomenon might be a conserved mechanism among plant species.
