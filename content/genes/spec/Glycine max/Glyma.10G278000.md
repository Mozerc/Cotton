## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.10G278000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmFAD2–1A</u>
- **Gene Name:** Fatty Acid Desaturase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Demonstration of highly efficient dual gRNA CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the homeologous **GmFAD2–1A** and GmFAD2–1B genes to yield a high oleic, low linoleic and α-linolenic acid phenotype in soybean.
   - The fatty acid profile analysis of T1 seeds derived from CRISPR-edited plants homozygous for both GmFAD2 genes showed dramatic increases in oleic acid content to over 80%, whereas linoleic acid decreased to 1.3–1.7%.
   - Palmitic and linolenic acid levels were also significantly reduced in the double GmFAD2 mutants, whereas stearic acid levels were comparable to wildtype.
   - Using the GmFAD2- 1A and GmFAD-1B genes are targets, we demonstrated that dual gRNA CRISPR/Cas9 system induced high frequency of heritable mutations in homeologous soybean genes.
