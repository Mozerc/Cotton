## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma10g42470]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FAD2-1A</u>
- **Gene Name:** omega-6 fatty acid desaturase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Mutant alleles of **FAD2-1A** and FAD2-1Bcombine to produce soybeans with the high oleic acid seed oil trait.
   - The objective of this work was to create the high oleic acid trait in soybeans by identifying and combining mutations in two delta-twelve fatty acid desaturase genes, **FAD2-1A** and FAD2-1B.
   - The mutant FAD2-1B alleles were associated with an increase in oleic acid levels, although the FAD2-1B mutant alleles alone were not capable of producing a high oleic acid phenotype.
   - When existing **FAD2-1A** mutations were combined with the novel mutant FAD2-1B alleles, a high oleic acid phenotype was recovered only for those lines which were homozygous for both of the mutant alleles.
