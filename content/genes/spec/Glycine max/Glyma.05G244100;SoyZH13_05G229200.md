## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.05G244100;SoyZH13_05G229200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmMFT</u>
- **Gene Name:** MOTHER-OF-FT-AND-TFL1
- **Genome:** [Williams 82 (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08670)/Zhonghuang 13 (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11427-019-9822-2)]()

## Functional Descriptions:
   - MOTHER-OF-FT-AND-TFL1 (**GmMFT**) regulates the seed oil and protein content in soybean.
   - Report that MOTHER-OF-FT-AND-TFL1 (**GmMFT**) is the gene of a classical QTL that has been reported to regulate seed oil and protein content in many studies.
   - Haplotype analysis showed that **GmMFT** has undergone selection, which resulted in the extended haplotype homozygosity in the cultivated soybean and the enriching of the oil-favorable allele in modern soybean cultivars.
   - This work unraveled the **GmMFT**-mediated mechanism regulating seed oil and protein content and seed weight, and revealed a previously unknown function of MFT that provides new insights into targeted soybean improvement and breeding.
