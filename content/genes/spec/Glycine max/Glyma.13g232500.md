## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.13g232500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmCHLI1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Wm82.a2.v1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmCHLI1**, a gene encoding the I subunit of magnesium (Mg)-chelatase, which functions in hexamers as responsible for the semi-dominant etiolation phenotype in soybean.
   - We performed map-based cloning and found that a CHLI homolog in soybean, **GmCHLI1**, is responsible for the etiolation phenotype.
   - These results indicate that the **GmCHLI1** and GmCHLI2 missense mutations not only affect interaction capacity but also influence the transcript abundance of Mg-chelatase subunits and subsequently block chlorophyll biosynthesis.
   - These results indicate that all four GmCHLIs can function as the CHLI subunit but that their functions could be dominant negatively affected by non-synonymous mutation of either copy of **GmCHLI1** and GmCHLI2, further suggesting that the different copies might interacted in nature.
