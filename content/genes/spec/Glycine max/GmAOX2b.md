## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmAOX2b</u>
- **Gene Name:** alternative oxidase 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A **GmAOX2b** antisense gene compromises vegetative growth and seed production in soybean.
   - Soybean (Glycine max) lines carrying a **GmAOX2b** antisense gene had compromised vegetative growth and reproductive performance under typical glasshouse growth conditions.
   - Compromised seed yield in **GmAOX2b** AS soybean is due to pre-fertilisation defects brought about by the impaired development and function of both male and female gametophytes.
   - Our finding that soybean containing a **GmAOX2b** antisense gene has reduced vegetative growth and reproductive capacity indicates that AOX is important to basic plant function, as well as being a determinant of fecundity, in this species.
