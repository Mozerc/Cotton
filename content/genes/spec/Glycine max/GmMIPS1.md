## Gene Details:

- **Gene Name:** myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - RNAi-mediated silencing of the myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase gene (**GmMIPS1**) in transgenic soybean inhibited seed development and reduced phytate content.
   - Merrill] lines were produced using interfering RNA (RNAi) construct in order to silence the myo-inositol-1-phosphate (**GmMIPS1**) gene. We have observed an absence of seed development in lines in which the presence of **GmMIPS1** transcripts was not detected.
   - In addition, a drastic reduction of phytate (InsP6) content was achieved in transgenic lines (up to 94.5%). Our results demonstrated an important correlation between **GmMIPS1** gene expression and seed development.
   - RNAi-mediated silencing of the myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase gene (**GmMIPS1**) in transgenic soybean inhibited seed development and reduced phytate content.
   - Experiments have been carried out to evaluate utilization of the **GmMIPS1** silencing strategy to inhibit seed development in fructiferous plants with the potential to develop seedless fruits.
