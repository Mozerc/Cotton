## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmSPX8</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmSPX8**, a nodule-localized regulator confers nodule development and nitrogen fixation under phosphorus starvation in soybean.
   - A nodule-localized SPX protein, **GmSPX8**, was discovered by transcriptome and functional analysis of its role in N2 fixation was characterized in soybean nodules.
   - **GmSPX8** was preferentially expressed in nodules and its expression was gradually increased during nodule development. And also the expression pattern was investigated using reporter gene Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by the promoter of **GmSPX8**.
   - These findings contribute novel insights towards the role of **GmSPX8** in nodule development and nitrogen fixation partly through interacting with GmPTF1 in soybean under low P condition.
