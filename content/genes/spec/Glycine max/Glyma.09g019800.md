## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.09g019800]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmVamp721d</u>
- **Gene Name:** vesicle-associated membrane protein 721d
- **Genome:** [Wm82.a2.v1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - VAMP721a and VAMP721d are important for pectin dynamics and release of bacteria in soybean nodules.
   - The localization of the main polysaccharide compounds of primary cell walls was analysed in control vs nodules with partially silenced **GmVamp721d**.
   - The silencing of **GmVamp721d** blocked the release of rhizobia. Instead of rhizobia-containing membrane compartments – symbiosomes – the infected cells contained big clusters of bacteria embedded in a matrix of methyl-esterified and de-methyl-esterified pectin. These clusters were surrounded by a membrane.
   - The biological role of VAMP721d may be explained by its action in delivering pectin-modifying enzymes to the site of release.
