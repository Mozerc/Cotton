## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.18G268400]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmMaT4</u>
- **Gene Name:** malonyl-CoA acyltransferase 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - GmMaT2 and **GmMaT4** recombinant enzymes used isoflavone 7-O-glucosides as acceptors and malonyl-CoA as an acyl donor to generate isoflavone glucoside malonates.
   - Overexpression in hairy roots of GmMaT2 and **GmMaT4** produced more malonyldaidzin, malonylgenistin, and malonylglycitin, and resulted in more nodules than control.
   - **GmMaT4** was highly expressed in seeds and flowers, followed by pods. This expression level suggests that **GmMaT4** may prefer 7-O-flavonols or 7-O-flavanone glucosides as substrates.
   - GmMaT2 and **GmMaT4** can synthesize malonyl isoflavone glucosides both in vitro and in vivo, as GmMaT2- and **GmMaT4**-OE hairy roots produced and secreted more malonyl isoflavone glucosides and developed more nodules compared with the GUS control.
