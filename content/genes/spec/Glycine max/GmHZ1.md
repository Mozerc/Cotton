## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmHZ1</u>
- **Gene Name:** HDZip I protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmHZ1** was characterized by the presence of a homeodomain (HD) with a closely linked leucine zipper motif (Zip).
   - **GmHZ1** can bind two 9-bp pseudopalindromic elements (CAAT(A/T)ATTG and CAAT(C/G)ATTG) with different affinity. Using GUS as a reporter gene, **GmHZ1** was proved to be a transcriptional activator and enhanced GUS expression by binding with the two elements in plant cells.
   - The expression of the **GmHZ1** was different between resistant and susceptible cultivars when inoculated with soybean mosaic virus (SMV) and may be related to SMV resistance.
   - These results indicate that the **GmHZ1** may have a transcriptional activator function in plant response to SMV infection.
