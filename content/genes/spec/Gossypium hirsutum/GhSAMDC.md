## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhSAMDC</u>
- **Gene Name:** S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase(**GhSAMDC**)-mediated spermine biosynthesis is required for salicylic acid- and leucine-correlated signaling in the defense response to Verticillium dahliae.
   - Silencing of GhSPMS or **GhSAMDC** in cotton leaves led to a significant accumulation of upstream substrates and, ultimately, enhanced plant susceptibility to Verticillium infection.
   - When compared with the wild type (WT), constitutive expression of **GhSAMDC** in Arabidopsis thaliana was associated with greater Verticillium wilt resistance and higher accumulations of Spm, salicylic acid, and leucine during the infection period.
   - Together, these results suggest that **GhSAMDC**-, rather than GhSPMS-, mediated spermine biosynthesis contributes to plant resistance against V. dahliae through SA- and leucine-correlated signaling.
