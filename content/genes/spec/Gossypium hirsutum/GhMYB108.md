## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhMYB108</u>
- **Gene Name:** defense-related MYB 108
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The cotton MYB108 forms a positive feedback regulation loop with CML11 and participates in the defense response against Verticillium dahliae infection.
   - Expression of **GhMYB108** in cotton plants was induced by Verticillium dahliae infection and responded to the application of defense signaling molecules, including salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene.
   - Knockdown of **GhMYB108** expression led to increased susceptibility of cotton plants to V. dahliae, while ecotopic overexpression of **GhMYB108** in Arabidopsis thaliana conferred enhanced tolerance to the pathogen.
   - Taken together, these results indicate that **GhMYB108** acts as a positive regulator in defense against V. dahliae infection by interacting with GhCML11.
