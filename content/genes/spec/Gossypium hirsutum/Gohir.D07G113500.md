## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gohir.D07G113500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhSP</u>
- **Gene Name:** SELF-PRUNING
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton has five TFL1-like genes: SELF-PRUNING (**GhSP**) is a single gene whereas there are two TFL1-like and BROTHER OF FT (BFT)-like genes, and these duplications are specific to the cotton lineage. 
   - **GhSP**, GhTFL1-L2, and GhBFT-L2 rescue the early flowering Attfl1-14 mutant phenotype, and the encoded polypeptides interact with a cotton FD protein.
   - Altering GhSFT and **GhSP** expression yielded highly determinate and productive cotton with reduced foliage and more synchronous fruiting. These results demonstrated that GhSFT and **GhSP** are important in regulating cotton architecture and suggested these could be targets for enhancing crop management and yield.
