## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_D11G3169]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhFAD2–3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [G. hirsutum (AD1_NBI)]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhFAD2–3** is required for anther development in Gossypium hirsutum.
   - The cellular phenotypic abnormality observed at the meiosis stage of the **GhFAD2–3** silenced plant (fad2–3) coincides with the significant reduction of C18:2 in anthers at the same stage.
   - Through compositional analysis of anthers cuticle and transcriptome data, we demonstrated it was unfavorable to the development of anther by regulating **GhFAD2–3** expression level to increase the oleic acid content.
   - We demonstrated that silencing of **GhFAD2–3** resulted in male sterility, due to nonviable pollen grains and abnormal anther development resulted from significantly reduced levels of PUFAs at the meiosis and tetrad stages.
