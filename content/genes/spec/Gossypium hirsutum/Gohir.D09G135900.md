## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gohir.D09G135900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhTFL1-L1</u>
- **Gene Name:** TERMINAL FLOWER 1-like
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We demonstrate that genes of the TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)-like clade show different roles in regulating growth patterns.
   - All genes of the cotton TFL1-like clade delay flowering when ectopically expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis, with the strongest phenotypes failing to produce functional flowers.
   - **GhTFL1-L1** and GhTFL1-L2 expression in the branch meristem were relatively consistent between photoperiod regimes whereas expression of GhSP and the GhBFT paralogs in branch meristems were higher in short days.
   - Heterologous promoter::GUS fusions illustrate differences in the regulation of these genes, suggesting that genes of the GhTFL1-like clade may not act redundantly. Characterizations of the GhCETS family provide strategies for nuanced control of plant growth.
