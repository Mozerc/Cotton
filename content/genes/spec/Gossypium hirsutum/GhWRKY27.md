## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhWRKY27</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY transcription factor 27
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhWRKY27**, was isolated and characterized. The expression of **GhWRKY27** was induced by leaf senescence and was higher in an early-ageing cotton variety than in a non-early-ageing cotton variety. 
   - Overexpression of **GhWRKY27** in Arabidopsis promoted leaf senescence, as determined by reduced chlorophyll content and elevated expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs).
   - The expression of GhRipen2–2 was significantly induced during leaf senescence and activated by **GhWRKY27**, suggesting its potential roles in leaf senescence and ageing regulatory pathways.
   - **GhWRKY27** may be a potential ageing-related factor and participate in leaf senescence together with GhTT2, GhCYP94C1 and GhRipen2–2. Our studies provide new mechanistic insight into the roles of WRKY genes during leaf senescence in cotton.
