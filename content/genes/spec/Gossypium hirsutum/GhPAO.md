## Gene Details:

- **Gene Name:** polyamine oxidase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton polyamine oxidase (**GhPAO**) is required for spermine and camalexin signalling in the defence response to Verticillium dahliae.
   - Recombinant cotton polyamine oxidase (**GhPAO**) was found to catalyse the conversion of spermine (Spm) to spermidine (Spd) in vitro. Constitutive expression of **GhPAO** in Arabidopsis thaliana produced improved resistance to V. dahliae and maintained putrescine, Spd and Spm at high levels.
   - Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), salicylic acid and camalexin (a phytoalexin) levels were distinctly increased in **GhPAO**-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants during V. dahliae infection when compared with wild-type plants, and Spm and camalexin efficiently inhibited growth of V. dahliae in vitro.
   - **GhPAO** silencing in cotton significantly reduced the Spd level and increased the Spm level, leading to enhanced susceptibility to infection by V. dahliae, and the levels of H2O2 and camalexin were distinctly lower in **GhPAO**-silenced cotton plants after V. dahliae infection.
