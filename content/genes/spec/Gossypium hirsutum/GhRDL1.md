## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhRDL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** dehydration-induced protein RD22-like protein1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we show that **GhRDL1** is localized in cell wall and interacts with GhEXPA1, an α-expansin functioning in wall loosening.
   - Expression of either **GhRDL1** or GhEXPA1 alone in Arabidopsis led to a substantial increase in seed size| interestingly, their co-expression resulted in the increased number of siliques, the nearly doubled seed mass, and the enhanced biomass production.
   - Cotton plants overexpressing **GhRDL1** and GhEXPA1 proteins produced strikingly more fruits (bolls), leading to up to 40% higher fiber yield per plant without adverse effects on fiber quality and vegetative growth.
   - Overall, data collected from the two field trials demonstrated that co-overexpression of **GhRDL1** and GhEXPA1 in cotton promoted boll production and cotton fiber yield, without adverse effects on either vegetative growth or fiber quality.
