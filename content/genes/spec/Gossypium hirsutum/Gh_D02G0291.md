## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_D02G0291]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhAPL</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [CottonFGD(https://www.elabcaas.cn/cottonfgd/)]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two candidate genes (**GhAPL** and GhHDA5) related to the NFFB were identified using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) experiments in this study.
   - Silencing of **GhAPL** and GhHDA5 delayed the flowering time and increased the NFFB compared to those of VA plants in cotton.
   - Our study preliminarily found that **GhAPL** and GhHDA5 are related to the early maturity in cotton. The findings provide a basis for the further functional verification of candidate genes related to the NFFB and contribute to the study of early maturity in cotton.
   - These results indicated that the silencing of **GhAPL** and GhHDA5 delayed the flowering time and increased the NFFB in cotton.
