## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [GH_A01G2052]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhOMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** flavonoid O-methyltransferase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Function deficiency of **GhOMT1** causes anthocyanidins over-accumulation and diversifies fibre colours in cotton.
   - The deficiency of **GhOMT1** in HS2 was associated with the activation of the anthocyanidin biosynthesis and the altered components of anthocyanidins.
   - **GhOMT1** played a critical role in anthocyanidin methylation and total anthocyanidins accumulation.
   - **GhOMT1** was proposed to function as a flavonoid O-methyltransferase similar to that in other plants, such as Vitis vinifera, Cyclamen persicum, and Catharanthus roseus.
