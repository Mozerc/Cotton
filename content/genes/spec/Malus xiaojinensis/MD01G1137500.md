## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD01G1137500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdLecRK-S.4.3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus xiaojinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MdLecRK-S.4.3** in apple (Malus domestica), a homologous gene of LecRK-S.4, was differentially expressed during infection by Valsa mali and Valsa pyri.
   - Overexpression of **MdLecRK-S.4.3** facilitated the induction of immune responses and enhanced the resistance to Valsa canker of fruits of apple and pear (Pyrus betulifolia), and of suspension cells of pear ‘Duli-G03’. 
   - The expression of PbePUB36, a RLCK XI sub-family member, was significantly repressed in the **MdLecRK-S.4.3**-overexpressing cell lines. Overexpression of PbePUB36 interfered with the resistance to Valsa canker and the immune response caused by up-regulation of **MdLecRK-S.4.3**.
   - whilst **MdLecRK-S.4.3** activated various immune responses and positively regulated Valsa canker resistance, this could be largely compromised by PbePUB36.
   - Overexpression of **MdLecRK-S.4.3** enhances the resistance of pear ‘Duli-G03’ suspension cells to Valsa canker.
