## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Bradi2g44270]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BdWRKY44</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Bd21 reference genome]()
- **Species:** *Brachypodium distachyon*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Demonstrated that Bd3-1, an accession of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon, is resistant to R. solani and, upon inoculation with the fungus, undergoes rapid induction of genes responsive to the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) that encode the WRKY TFs BdWRKY38 and **BdWRKY44**.
   - A gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis based on the transcriptome dataset demonstrated that BdWRKY38 was a GRN hub connected to many target genes specifically in resistant accessions, whereas **BdWRKY44** was shared in the GRNs of all three accessions.
   - **BdWRKY44**-kd plants also exhibited compromised R. solani resistance, but the degree of decreased resistance was approximately 10 times lower than that in BdWRKY38-kd plants.
