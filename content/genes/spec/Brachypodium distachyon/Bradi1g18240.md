## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Bradi1g18240]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FPL7</u>
- **Gene Name:** FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR 7
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brachypodium distachyon*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - FPL1 and **FPL7** repress flowering under long-day conditions in B. distachyon.
   - FPL1 and **FPL7** interact with the components of the florigen activation complex (FAC) and complex formation as well as its activity to restrict expression of its critical target, VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1), in leaves, thereby preventing subsequent overaccumulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (FT1) at the juvenile stage to avoid premature flowering.
   - At the late vegetative stage, VRN1 directly binds the FPL1 promoter and represses FPL1 expression as it gradually accumulates, thus allowing proper FT1 expression in leaves and ensuring sufficient FAC formation in shoot apical meristems to initiate timely flowering.
