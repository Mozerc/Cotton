## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MELO3C017499]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CmDXS2a</u>
- **Gene Name:** 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In the case of DXS, three genes encode functional DXS activities which fall into previously established type I (CmDXS1) and II (**CmDXS2a** and CmDXS2b) categories, while a fourth DXS-like gene belonging to the type III group did not encode a protein with DXS activity.
   - Their expression patterns and phylogenies suggest that CmDXS1 is functionally specialized for developmental and photosynthetic processes, while **CmDXS2a** and CmDXS2b are induced in flowers and ripening fruit of orange- (but not white-) fleshed varieties, coinciding with Î²-carotene accumulation.
   - CmDXS1 was expressed in all organs analysed with the exception of roots. By contrast, transcripts for both type II DXS isoforms, **CmDXS2a** and CmDXS2b, were most abundant in flowers
   - We report that small-scale gene duplications in the MEP pathway have led to specialized isoforms in melon which play an important role in providing carotenoid precursors during fruit ripening, including the first report of type II DXS proteins involved in this process.
