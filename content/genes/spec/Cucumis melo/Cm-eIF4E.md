## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Cm-eIF4E</u>
- **Gene Name:** eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Melon RNA interference (RNAi) lines silenced for **Cm-eIF4E** show broad virus resistance.
   - **Cm-eIF4E** knockdown melon plants were generated by the transformation of explants with a construct that was designed to induce the silencing of this gene, and the plants from T2 generations were genetically and phenotypically characterized.
   - In transformed plants, **Cm-eIF4E** was specifically silenced, as identified by the decreased accumulation of **Cm-eIF4E** mRNA and the appearance of small interfering RNAs derived from the transgene, whereas the Cm-eIF(iso)4E mRNA levels remained unaffected. 
   - **Cm-eIF4E** controls melon susceptibility to these four viruses. Therefore, **Cm-eIF4E** is an efficient target for the identification of new resistance alleles able to confer broad-spectrum virus resistance in melon.
