## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MELO3C024190]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CmThAT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Thiol acyltransferase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Thiol acyltransferase (**CmThAT1**) gene was identified within the QTL interval of its product, S-methyl-thioacetate, a key component of melon fruit aroma.
   - **CmThAT1** catalyzed the enzymatic production of S-methyl thioacetate from methanethiol and acetyl-CoA, and of S-methyl propanethioate from methanethiol and propanoyl-CoA, in vitro.
   - The production of thioesters in melon fruit is mediated by the ThAT gene **CmThAT1**.
   - **CmThAT1** may have additional functions in acetoacetyl-CoA synthesis, its function in volatile thioester biosynthesis is clear and supported by genetic, co-expression and in vitro analyses.
