## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [FvH4_1g22020]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FveMYB10</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3-MYB transcription factor 10
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The R2R3-MYB transcription factor **FveMYB10** is a major regulator of anthocyanin pigmentation in the red fruits of strawberry. **FveMYB10** loss-of-function mutants form yellow fruits but still accumulate purple-colored anthocyanins in the petioles, suggesting that anthocyanin biosynthesis is under distinct regulation in fruits and petioles.
   - Confirmed that the causative mutation resides in a **FveMYB10**-Like (**FveMYB10**L) gene and that **FveMYB10** and **FveMYB10**L function independently in the fruit and petiole, respectively.
   - In addition to their tissue-specific regulation, **FveMYB10** and **FveMYB10**L respond differently to changes in light quality, produce distinct anthocyanin compositions, and preferentially activate different downstream anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in their respective tissues.
   - The **FveMYB10** and **FveMYB10**L genes offer flexible regulation of anthocyanin accumulation under different developmental and environmental conditions.
