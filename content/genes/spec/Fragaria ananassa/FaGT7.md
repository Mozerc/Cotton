## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaGT7</u>
- **Gene Name:** UDP-glucose glucosyltransferase7
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two glucosyltransferases, FaGT6 and **FaGT7**, were cloned from a strawberry (Fragaria√óananassa) cDNA library and the full-length open reading frames were amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends.
   - FaGT6 and **FaGT7** accepted a number of substrates and formed multiple products when assayed with quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin, which are potential substrates that occur naturally in strawberry.
   - FaGT6 and **FaGT7** are multifunctional glycosyltransferases that are mainly expressed in strawberry achenes and are induced by SA. This indicates that they may take over an additional role in the detoxification of xenobiotics, contributing to the defence capacity of strawberry achenes.
   - Thus, it appears that FaGT6 and **FaGT7** are involved in the glucosylation of flavonols and may also participate in xenobiotic metabolism. The latter function is supported by the proven ability of strawberries to glucosylate selected unnatural substrates injected in ripe fruits.
   - A role for FaGT6 and **FaGT7** in the glucosylation of xenobiotics was supported by the capability of strawberry fruits to glucosylate several unnatural compounds including 2-naphthol when injected in ripe fruits.
