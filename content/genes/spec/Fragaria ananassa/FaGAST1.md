## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaGAST1</u>
- **Gene Name:** GAST-like gene1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - FaGAST2, a strawberry ripening-related gene, acts together with **FaGAST1** to determine cell size of the fruit receptacle.
   - However, transitory silencing of FaGAST2 gene expression through RNA interference approaches revealed an increase in **FaGAST1** expression, but no changes in fruit cell size were observed.
   - The FaGAST2 and **FaGAST1** expression pattern during strawberry fruit growth and ripening indicate that both are ripening-related genes.
   - These results suggest that the expression of FaGAST2 and **FaGAST1** genes would not be regulated either by GA3 or by ABA.
