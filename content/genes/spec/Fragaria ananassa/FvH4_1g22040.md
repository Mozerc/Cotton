## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [FvH4_1g22040]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FveMYB10L</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3-MYB transcription factor 10 Like
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using mapping-by-sequencing and transient functional assays, we confirmed that the causative mutation resides in a FveMYB10-Like (**FveMYB10L**) gene and that FveMYB10 and **FveMYB10L** function independently in the fruit and petiole, respectively.
   - In addition to their tissue-specific regulation, FveMYB10 and **FveMYB10L** respond differently to changes in light quality, produce distinct anthocyanin compositions, and preferentially activate different downstream anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in their respective tissues.
   - **FveMYB10L** falls within a clade of anthocyanin biosynthetic regulators.
   - The FveMYB10 and **FveMYB10L** genes offer flexible regulation of anthocyanin accumulation under different developmental and environmental conditions.
