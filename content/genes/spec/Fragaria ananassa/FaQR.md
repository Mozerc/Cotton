## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaQR</u>
- **Gene Name:** 2-methylene-furan-3-one reductase-like
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **FaQR**, Required for the Biosynthesis of the Strawberry Flavor Compound 4-Hydroxy-2,5-Dimethyl-3(2H)-Furanone, Encodes an Enone Oxidoreductase.
   - Laser capture microdissection followed by RNA extraction and amplification demonstrated the presence of **FaQR** mRNA in parenchyma tissue of the strawberry fruit.
   - The **FaQR** protein was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, and the monomer catalyzed the formation of HDMF. After chemical synthesis and liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry analysis, 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-2-methylene-3(2H)-furanone was confirmed as a substrate of **FaQR** and the natural precursor of HDMF.
   - This study demonstrates the function of the **FaQR** enzyme in the biosynthesis of HDMF as enone oxidoreductase and provides a foundation for the improvement of strawberry flavor and the biotechnological production of HDMF.
