## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaDOF2</u>
- **Gene Name:** ZnF-Dof-type transcription factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The fruit-specific transcription factor **FaDOF2** regulates the production of eugenol in ripe fruit receptacles.
   - Identified and functionally characterized **FaDOF2**, a DOF-type ripening-related transcription factor, which is hormonally regulated and specific to the receptacle, though high expression levels were also found in petals.
   - **FaDOF2** expression was silenced in ripe strawberry receptacles, the expression of FaEOBII and FaEGS2, two key genes involved in eugenol production, were down-regulated. These fruits showed a concomitant decrease in eugenol content, which confirmed that **FaDOF2** is a transcription factor that is involved in eugenol production in ripe fruit receptacles.
   - These results provide evidence that **FaDOF2** plays a subsidiary regulatory role with FaEOBII in the expression of genes encoding enzymes that control eugenol production.
