## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaAAT2</u>
- **Gene Name:** alcohol acyltransferase2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The fruit ripening-related gene **FaAAT2** encodes an acyl transferase involved in strawberry aroma biogenesis.
   - This study identified a novel strawberry alcohol acyltransferase gene (**FaAAT2**) whose expression pattern during fruit receptacle growth and ripening is in accordance with the production of esters throughout strawberry fruit ripening.
   - When **FaAAT2** expression was transiently downregulated in the fruit receptacle by agroinfiltration, the volatile ester production was significantly reduced in strawberry fruit.
   - The results suggest that **FaAAT2** plays a significant role in the production of esters that contribute to the final strawberry fruit flavour.
