## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaPYR1</u>
- **Gene Name:** abscisic acid receptor PYR1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Down-regulation of the **FaPYR1** gene not only significantly delayed fruit ripening, but also markedly altered ABA content, ABA sensitivity, and a set of ABA-responsive gene transcripts, including ABI1 and SnRK2.
   - The loss of red colouring in **FaPYR1** RNAi (RNA interference) fruits could not be rescued by exogenously applied ABA, which could promote the ripening of wild-type fruits.
   - Collectively, these results demonstrate that the putative ABA receptor **FaPYR1** acts as a positive regulator in strawberry fruit ripening.
   - These results demonstrated that **FaPYR1** plays an important role in the regulation of strawberry fruit ripening.
