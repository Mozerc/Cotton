## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaGAST2</u>
- **Gene Name:** GAST-like gene2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **FaGAST2**, a strawberry ripening-related gene, acts together with FaGAST1 to determine cell size of the fruit receptacle.
   - Identified a novel strawberry FaGAST gene (**FaGAST2**) whose expression showed an increase throughout fruit receptacle development and ripening, coinciding with those stages where a decrease in fruit expansion processes (G3–W and R–OR stages) occurs.
   - The expression of the **FaGAST2** gene also increased under oxidative stress conditions (H2O2 or Colletotrichum acutatum infection), suggesting a direct role for **FaGAST2** protein in reactive oxygen species scavenging during fruit growth and ripening and during fungal infection.
   - The overexpression of the **FaGAST2** gene in different transgenic lines analyzed caused a delay in the growth of strawberry plants and a reduction in the size of the transgenic fruits.
   - However, transitory silencing of **FaGAST2** gene expression through RNA interference approaches revealed an increase in FaGAST1 expression, but no changes in fruit cell size were observed. These results support the hypothesis that both genes must act synergistically to determine fruit cell size during fruit development and ripening.
