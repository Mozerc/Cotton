## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_10s0116g00150]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VdCRK10</u>
- **Gene Name:** Vitis davidii cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase 10
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis davidii*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The activity of the **VdCRK10** promoter is induced by C. diplodiella and is higher than that of Vitis vitifera VvCRK10, indicating the involvement of transcriptional regulation in CRK10 gene expression.
   - Our results highlight the potential of **VdCRK10** as a resistant gene for enhancing white rot resistance in grapevine.
   - The overexpression of the **VdCRK10** gene in susceptible grapevine plants resulted in enhanced resistance against C. diplodiella infection.
   - The cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase **VdCRK10** targeted by Coniella diplodiella effector CdE1 contributes to white rot resistance in grapevine.
