## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PaICE1</u>
- **Gene Name:** CBF expression1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Phalaenopsis aphrodite*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cold Response in Phalaenopsis aphrodite and Characterization of PaCBF1 and **PaICE1**.
   - At the molecular level, C-repeat binding factor1 (PaCBF1) and its putative target gene dehydrin1 (PaDHN1) mRNAs were induced by cold, whereas inducer of CBF expression1 (**PaICE1**) mRNA was constitutively expressed.
   - **PaICE1** transactivated MYC motifs in the PaCBF1 promoter, indicating that up-regulation of PaCBF1 may be mediated by the binding of **PaICE1** to MYC motifs.
   - Herein, we present evidence that cold induction of PaCBF1 transcripts in P. aphrodite may be transactivated by **PaICE1** and consequently protect plants from cold damage through up-regulation of cold-regulated (COR) genes, such as DHN.
