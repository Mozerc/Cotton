## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Seita.9G089700]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SiPHYC</u>
- **Gene Name:** PHYTOCHROME C
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Setaria italica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, genomic variations of PHYTOCHROME C (PHYC) between wild and cultivated Setaria gene pools were analysed and three **SiPHYC** mutants were identified.
   - **SiPHYC** mutants and knockout transgenic plants showed an early heading date and a loss of response to short-day photoperiod.
   - This research indicated that **SiPHYC** undergoes a selection during domestication, and it is a key factor determining Setaria as a SD plant.
   - Our results suggest that domestication-associated **SiPHYC** repressed flowering and determined Setaria as a short-day plant, and **SiPHYC** mutants possess the potential for creating efficient indoor cultivation system suitable for research on Setaria as a model, and either for maize or sorghum as well.Doi:
