## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Seita.7G201100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SiAGO1b</u>
- **Gene Name:** Argonaute 1
- **Genome:** [S. italica genome database V2.2]()
- **Species:** *Setaria italica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The C-terminal motif of **SiAGO1b** is required for the regulation of growth, development and stress responses in foxtail millet.
   - Map-based cloning analysis demonstrated that these phenotypic variations were attributed to a Câ€“A transversion, and a 7-bp deletion in the C-terminus of the **SiAGO1b** gene in **SiAGO1b**.
   - Furthermore, 1598 differentially expressed genes were detected via RNA-seq-based comparison of **SiAGO1b** and wild-type plants, which revealed that **SiAGO1b** mutation influenced multiple biological processes, including energy metabolism, cell growth, programmed death and abiotic stress responses in foxtail millet.
   - These results demonstrate the functional role of **SiAGO1b** in foxtail millet and support its importance in plant growth and development.
