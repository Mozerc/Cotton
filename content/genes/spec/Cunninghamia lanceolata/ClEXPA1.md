## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ClEXPA1</u>
- **Gene Name:** α-expansin1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cunninghamia lanceolata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of two cambium-abundant Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) α-expansin genes **ClEXPA1** and ClEXPA2 affect growth and development in transgenic tobacco and increase the amount of cellulose in stem cell walls.
   - Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that they belong to α-expansin (EXPA), named **ClEXPA1** and ClEXPA2. Expression pattern analysis demonstrated that they are preferentially expressed in the cambium region.
   - Overexpression of **ClEXPA1** and ClEXPA2 in tobacco plants yielded pleiotropic phenotypes of plant height, stem diameter, leaf number and seed pod.
   - Isolated cell walls of **ClEXPA1** and ClEXPA2 overexpressors contained 30%–50% higher cellulose contents than the wild type, accompanied by a thickening of the cell walls in the xylem region. 
   - Both **ClEXPA1** and ClEXPA2 are involved in plant growth and development, with a partially functional overlap. Expansins are not only able to induce cell expansion in different tissues/organs in vivo, but they also can act as a potential activator during secondary wall formation by directly or indirectly affecting cellulose metabolism, probably in a cell type-dependent manner.
