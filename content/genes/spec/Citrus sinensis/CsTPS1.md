## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsTPS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** terpene synthase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The role and function of CitAP2.10 in (+)-valencene biosynthesis were confirmed using the Arabidopsis homolog (AtWRI1), which also transiently activated the **CsTPS1** promoter.
   - Transient over-expression of CitAP2.10 triggered (+)-valencene biosynthesis in sweet orange fruit. These results indicate that CitAP2.10 regulates (+)-valencene synthesis via induction of **CsTPS1** mRNA accumulation.
   - A potential role for CitAP2.10 in regulating citrus (+)-valencene production was examined by transient overexpression in citrus peels and the action on the promoter of the target gene **CsTPS1** was studied using a tobacco dual-luciferase assay.
   - Screening for CitAP2/ERF genes encoding proteins that activate the Terpene Synthase 1 (**CsTPS1**) promoter.
