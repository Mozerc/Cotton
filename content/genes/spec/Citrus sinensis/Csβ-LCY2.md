## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Csβ-LCY2</u>
- **Gene Name:** beta-cyclase2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The β-cyclization of lycopene, catalysed by the lycopene β-cyclases (β-LCY), seems to be a key regulatory step of the carotenoid pathway. In the present study, two β-LCYs from orange fruits (Citrus sinensis), named Csβ-LCY1 and **Csβ-LCY2** have been isolated and the activity of the encoded proteins was demonstrated by functional analysis.
   - Csβ-LCY1 was expressed at low levels and remained relatively constant during fruit ripening while **Csβ-LCY2** showed a chromoplast-specific expression and a marked induction in both peel and pulp of orange fruits in parallel with the accumulation of β,β-xanthophylls.
   - Expression of **Csβ-LCY2** and another seven carotenoid biosynthetic genes were studied in the peel and pulp of the high lycopene-accumulating grapefruit, Star Ruby, and compared with those of ordinary Navel orange.
   - It is suggested that the presence of diverse alleles of the β-LCY2 gene, encoding enzymes with altered activity, with different transcript accumulation may be an additional regulatory mechanism of carotenoid synthesis involved in the accumulation of lycopene in red grapefruits.
