## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsRBOH2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Plants overexpressing CsWRKY25 were more resistant to CBC and showed higher expression of the respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH) **CsRBOH2**, in addition to exhibiting increased RBOH activity.
   - Transient overexpression assays in citrus confirmed that CsWRKY25 and **CsRBOH2** participated in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts, which were able to restore the ROS degradation caused by CsAP2-09 knockdown.
   - **CsRBOH2** knockdown had been reported previously to reduce the CBC resistance, while demonstrated in this study, **CsRBOH2** transient overexpression can enhance the CBC resistance. 
   - Our results outline a pathway through which CsAP2-09-CsWRKY25 transcriptionally reprograms **CsRBOH2**-mediated ROS homeostasis in a manner conducive to CBC resistance. 
   - The CsAP2-09-CsWRKY25-**CsRBOH2** cascade confers resistance against citrus bacterial canker by regulating ROS homeostasis.
