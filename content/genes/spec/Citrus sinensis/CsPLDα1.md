## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsPLDα1</u>
- **Gene Name:** phospholipase D alpha
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CsPLDα1** and CsPLDγ1 are differentially induced during leaf and fruit abscission and diurnally regulated in Citrus sinensis.
   - **CsPLDα1** expression was diurnally regulated in leaf blade but not fruit peel. CsPLDγ1 exhibited strong diurnal oscillation in expression in leaves and fruit peel with peak expression around midday.
   - While diurnal fluctuation in **CsPLDα1** expression appeared to be light-entrained in leaves, CsPLDγ1 expression was regulated by light and the circadian clock. The diurnal expression of both genes was modulated by ethylene-signalling.
   - The results indicate differential regulation of **CsPLDα1** and CsPLDγ1 in leaves and fruit, and suggest possible roles for PLD-dependent signalling in regulating abscission responses in citrus.
