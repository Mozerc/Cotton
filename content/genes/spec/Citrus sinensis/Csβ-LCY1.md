## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Csβ-LCY1</u>
- **Gene Name:** beta-cyclase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The β-cyclization of lycopene, catalysed by the lycopene β-cyclases (β-LCY), seems to be a key regulatory step of the carotenoid pathway. In the present study, two β-LCYs from orange fruits (Citrus sinensis), named **Csβ-LCY1** and Csβ-LCY2 have been isolated and the activity of the encoded proteins was demonstrated by functional analysis.
   - **Csβ-LCY1** was expressed at low levels and remained relatively constant during fruit ripening while Csβ-LCY2 showed a chromoplast-specific expression and a marked induction in both peel and pulp of orange fruits in parallel with the accumulation of β,β-xanthophylls.
   - Sequence comparison between full-length cDNAs and genomic sequences of Citrus β-LCY1 and β-LCY2 revealed an intronless structure for both genes. DNA blot hybridization with total genomic DNA indicated that both β-LCY1 and β-LCY2 probably exist in a single copy in the C. sinensis genome (data not shown).
   - The resulting activities were 95.45±1.20 for **Csβ-LCY1** and of 38.33±11.40 for Csβ-LCY2, demonstrating that both genes encoded functional lycopene β-cyclases.
