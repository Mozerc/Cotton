## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Prupe.4G029900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PpTPS2</u>
- **Gene Name:** terpene synthase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Prunus persica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli and transient overexpression in tobacco and peach fruits showed PpTPS1 was localized in plastids and associated with production of linalool, while **PpTPS2** was responsible for (E,E)-α-farnesene biosynthesis in the cytoplasm.
   - It is likely that PpTPS1 catalyses the biosynthesis of monoterpenes in plastids from GPP and **PpTPS2** produces sesquiterpenes in the cytosol using FPP as substrates.
   - These results suggest that PpTPS1 and **PpTPS2** are genes contributing directly to changes in linalool and (E,E)-α-farnesene in response to UV-B irradiation in both leaves and fruits of peach.
   - These results indicated that PpTPS1 was involved in the biosynthesis of peach linalool.
   - These results suggested that PpTPS1 and **PpTPS2** are responsible for changes in production of linalool and (E,E)-α-farnesene caused by UV-B irradiation.
