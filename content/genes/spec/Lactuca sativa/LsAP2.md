## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LsAP2</u>
- **Gene Name:** APETALA2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lactuca sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The lettuce APETALA2 (**LsAP2**) gene regulates leaf morphology. **LsAP2** encodes a transcriptional repressor that contains the conserved EAR motif, which mediates interactions with the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (TPL/TPR) corepressors.
   - Overexpression of **LsAP2** led to small and crinkly leaves, and many bulges were seen on the surface of the leaf blade.
   - **LsAP2** physically interacted with the CINCINNATA (CIN)-like TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP) transcription factors and inhibited their transcriptional activation activity.
   - Together, these results showed that **LsAP2** was expressed in leaves and shoot apexes, suggesting that **LsAP2** may play roles during the vegetative growth of lettuce.
