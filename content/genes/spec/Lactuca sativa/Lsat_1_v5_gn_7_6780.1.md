## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Lsat_1_v5_gn_7_6780.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LsSOC1</u>
- **Gene Name:** SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lactuca sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - LCM-seq reveals the crucial role of **LsSOC1** in heat-promoted bolting of lettuce.
   - **LsSOC1** knockdown by RNA interference resulted in a significant delay in the timing of bolting and insensitivity to high temperature, which indicated that **LsSOC1** functions as an activator during heat-promoted bolting in lettuce.
   - We determined that two heat shock transcription factors, HsfA1e and HsfA4c, bound to the promoter of **LsSOC1** to confirm that **LsSOC1** played an important role in heat-promoted bolting.
   - This study indicates that **LsSOC1** plays a crucial role in the heat-promoted bolting process in lettuce. Further investigation of **LsSOC1** may be useful for clarification of the bolting mechanism in lettuce.
