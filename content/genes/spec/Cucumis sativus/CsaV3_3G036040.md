## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [CsaV3_3G036040]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsRAX2</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3-MYB transcription factor 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - CsRAXs negatively regulate leaf size and fruiting ability through auxin glycosylation in cucumber.
   - Csrax5 single mutant exhibited enlarged leaf size and stem diameter, and Csrax1/2/5 triple mutant displayed further enlargement phenotype.
   - Overexpression of CsRAX1 or CsRAX5 gave rise to smaller leaf and thinner stem. The fruiting ability of Csrax1/**CsRAX2**/CsRAX5 plants was significantly enhanced, while that of CsRAX5 overexpression lines was greatly weakened.
   - Biochemical data indicated that CsRAX1/CsRAX5 directly promoted the expression of auxin glucosyltransferase gene CsUGT74E2.
   - CsRAXs function as repressors for leaf size development by promoting auxin glycosylation to decrease free auxin level and cell division in cucumber.
