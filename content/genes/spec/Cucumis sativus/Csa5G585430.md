## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa5G585430]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsSEC23</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - MutMap, genotyping, and gene editing results demonstrated that **CsSEC23**, which is the core component of COPII vesicles, mediates the glossiness of cucumber fruit peel. **CsSEC23** is functionally conserved and located in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum.
   - **CsSEC23** could interact with CsSEC31, but this interaction was absent in the Csgp mutant, which decreased the efficiency of COPII vesicle transportation. 
   - The wax and cutin contents were also changed due to **CsSEC23** mutation.
   - Taken together, the results obtained from this study revealed that **CsSEC23** mediates cucumber glossiness, and this mediating might be affected by COPII vesicle transportation.
