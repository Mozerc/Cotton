## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa3G748220]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsGL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Glabrous 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CsGL1** controls the formation of cucumber trichomes, including foliar trichomes, fruit spines, and bloom trichomes.
   - **CsGL1** was isolated and it was found that it encoded a member of the homeodomain-leucine zipper I (HD-Zip I) proteins previously identified to function mainly in the abiotic stress responses of plants.
   - A comparative analysis of the digital gene expression (DGE) profile between **CsGL1** and WT leaves revealed that **CsGL1** had a significant influence on the gene expression profile in cucumber, especially on genes related to cellular process, which is consistent with the phenotypic difference between **CsGL1** and the WT.
   - The characterization of trichome development in wild-type (WT) cucumber and a spontaneous mutant, glabrous 1 (**CsGL1**) controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene, with glabrous aerial organs, is reported.
