## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa5G322500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsSUS4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Sucrose Synthase 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Down-Regulating Cucumber Sucrose Synthase 4 (**CsSUS4**) Suppresses the Growth and Development of Flowers and Fruits.
   - Transcript analyses showed that **CsSUS4** was predominantly expressed in sink organs, particularly in flowers, fruits and roots, and that **CsSUS4** protein was localized to companion cells and phloem parenchyma cells.
   - Down-regulation of **CsSUS4** expression resulted in a decrease in SUS activity in conjunction with lower hexose, starch and cellulose contents in fruits, and led to an overall reduction in the size and weight of flowers and fruits.
   - **CsSUS4** overexpression (OE) lines exhibited increased carbohydrate content, and larger and heavier flowers and fruits.
   - These results demonstrate that **CsSUS4** plays important roles in the growth and development of cucumber flowers and fruits.
