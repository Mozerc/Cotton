## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa7M446860]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsKF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Kinesin protein1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization and expression profiling of cucumber kinesin genes during early fruit development: revealing the roles of kinesins in exponential cell production and enlargement in cucumber fruit.
   - Function of novel kinesins **CsKF1**, CsKF2, and CsKF3 in early cucumber fruit development.
   - The results also indicated that **CsKF1** localized to the plasma membrane of fast-expanding fruit cells, that CsKF2 might play a role in fruit chloroplast division, and that CsKF3 is involved in the function or formation of phragmoplasts in fruit telophase cells.
   - The results strongly suggest that specific fruit-enriched kinesins are specialized in their functions in rapid cell division and expansion during cucumber fruit development.
