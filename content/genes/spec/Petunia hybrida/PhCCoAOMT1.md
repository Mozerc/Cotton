## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhCCoAOMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** caffeoyl-coenzyme A O-methyltransferase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Petunia hybrida*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cloned and characterized a caffeoyl-coenzyme A O-methyltransferase (**PhCCoAOMT1**) from the petals of the fragrant petunia ‘Mitchell’. Recombinant **PhCCoAOMT1** indeed catalyzed the methylation of caffeoyl-CoA to produce feruloyl CoA. 
   - Silencing of **PhCCoAOMT1** resulted in a reduction of eugenol production but not of isoeugenol. Unexpectedly, the transgenic plants had purple-colored leaves and pink flowers, despite the fact that cv Mitchell lacks the functional R2R3-MYB master regulator ANTHOCYANIN2 and has normally white flowers.
   - Our results indicate that down-regulation of **PhCCoAOMT1** activated the anthocyanin pathway through the R2R3-MYBs PURPLE HAZE (PHZ) and DEEP PURPLE, with predominantly petunidin accumulating.
   - Our results demonstrate a role for **PhCCoAOMT1** in phenylpropene production and reveal a link between **PhCCoAOMT1** and anthocyanin production.
