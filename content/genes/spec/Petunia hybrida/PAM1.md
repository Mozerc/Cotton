## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PAM1</u>
- **Gene Name:** penetration and arbuscule morphogenesis 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Petunia hybrida*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We have previously identified a mutant in Petunia hybrida, penetration and arbuscule morphogenesisâ€ƒ1 (**PAM1**), that is defective in the intracellular stages of AM development.
   - Here, we report on the cloning of **PAM1**, which encodes a VAPYRIN homologue. **PAM1** protein localizes to the cytosol and the nucleus, with a prominent affinity to mobile spherical structures that are associated with the tonoplast, and are therefore referred to as tonospheres.

   - **PAM1** may represent a component of an ancient cellular machinery that pre-dates the advent of vascular plants, and which became essential, during the course of the evolution of AM symbiosis, for intracellular accommodation and morphogenesis of the fungal endosymbiont.
