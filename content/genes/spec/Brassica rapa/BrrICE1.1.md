## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BrrICE1.1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ICE1-like transcription factor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica rapa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **BrrICE1.1** is associated with putrescine synthesis through regulation of the arginine decarboxylase gene in freezing tolerance of turnip.
   - The function of putrescine in turnip was further analyzed by exogenous application putrescine and its inhibitor DL-Î±-(Difluoromethyl) arginine (DFMA) under freezing tolerance. In addition, the **BrrICE1.1** was found to be involved in the ICE1-CBF pathway to increase the freezing stress of turnip.
   - **BrrICE1.1** could bind the promoter of BrrADC2.2 or CBFs to participate in freezing tolerance of turnip by transcriptomics and targeted metabolomics analyses.
   - The expression level analysis together with the putrescine content analysis presented here may indicate that **BrrICE1.1** positively regulates the expression of BrrADC2.2 in freezing stress of turnip.
