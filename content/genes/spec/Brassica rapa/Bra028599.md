## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Bra028599]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b</u>
- **Gene Name:** FLOWERING LOCUS C2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica rapa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A naturally occurring InDel variation in **BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b** (**BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b**) associated with flowering time variation in Brassica rapa.
   - Analyses of different segregating populations have suggested that BraA.FLC.a (BrFLC1) and **BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b** (**BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b**) play major roles in controlling flowering time in B. rapa.
   - Our results suggest that the naturally occurring deletion mutation across exon 4 and intron 4 in **BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b** gene contributes greatly to variation in flowering time in oil-type B. rapa. 
   - The observed different relationship between BrFLC1 or **BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b** and flowering time variation indicates that the control of flowering time has evolved separately between oil-type and vegetable-type B. rapa groups.
   - **BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b** (FLOWERING LOCUS C) as a candidate gene for a vernalization response QTL in Brassica rapa.
   - **BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b** maps under a major flowering time and vernalization response quantitative trait locus (QTL) at the top of A02.
   - The reduction of **BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b** expression upon seedling vernalization of both early and late flowering DH lines was strongest at the seedling stage and diminished in subsequent growth stages, which suggests that the commitment to flowering is already set at very early developmental stages.
   - Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that **BrFLC2|BraA.FLC.b** is a candidate gene for the flowering time and vernalization response QTL in B. rapa.
