## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LepR3</u>
- **Gene Name:** receptor-like protein 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Brassica napus blackleg resistance gene **LepR3** encodes a receptor-like protein triggered by the Leptosphaeria maculans effector AVRLM1.
   - **LepR3**, found in the Brassica napus cv ‘Surpass 400’, provides race-specific resistance to the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans, which was overcome after great devastation in Australia in 2004. 
   - **LepR3** was found to encode a receptor-like protein (RLP). We also demonstrated that avirulence towards **LepR3** is conferred by AvrLm1, which is responsible for both the Rlm1 and **LepR3**-dependent resistance responses in B. napus.
   - **LepR3** is the first functional B. napus disease resistance gene to be cloned. AvrLm1's interaction with two independent resistance loci, Rlm1 and **LepR3**, highlights the need to consider redundant phenotypes in ‘gene-for-gene’ interactions and offers an explanation as to why **LepR3** was overcome so rapidly in parts of Australia.
