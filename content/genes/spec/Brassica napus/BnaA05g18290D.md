## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [BnaA05g18290D]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnUC1</u>
- **Gene Name:** up-curling leaf mutant
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - An up-curling leaf mutant **BnUC1** was controlled by one dominant locus **BnUC1**. This locus had positive effects on photosynthetic efficiency, negative effects on some agronomic traits, and may help to increase planting density in B. napus.
   - The near-isogenic line of the up-curling leaf (ZS11-UC1) was constructed to evaluate the effect of **BnUC1** on photosynthetic efficiency. The results indicated that the up-curling leaf trait locus was beneficial to improve the photosynthetic efficiency.
   - We studied its inheritance, mapped the up-curling leaf locus **BnUC1**, built near-isogenic lines for the **BnUC1** mutant, and evaluated the effect of the dominant leaf curl locus on leaf photosynthetic efficiency and agronomic traits.
   - Our results will lay a good foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the up-curling leaf phenotype in B. napus, and provide clues for further positional cloning and functional research related to **BnUC1**.
