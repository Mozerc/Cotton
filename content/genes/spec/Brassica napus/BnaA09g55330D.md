## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [BnaA09g55330D]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnSHP1.A9</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A copia-like retrotransposon insertion in the upstream region of the SHATTERPROOF1 gene, **BnSHP1.A9**, is associated with quantitative variation in pod shattering resistance in oilseed rape.
   - The pod shatter resistance at quantitative trait locus qSRI.A9.1 is controlled by one of the B. napus SHATTERPROOF1 homologs, **BnSHP1.A9**, in a doubled haploid population generated from parents designated R1 and R2 as well as in a diverse panel of oilseed rape.
   - Transgenic plants constitutively expressing either of the **BnSHP1.A9** alleles from the R1 and R2 parental lines showed that both alleles are responsible for pod shattering, via a mechanism that promotes lignification of the enb layer. 
   - We showed a copia-like retrotransposon-based marker, **BnSHP1.A9**R2, can be used for marker-assisted breeding targeting the pod shatter resistance trait in oilseed rape.
