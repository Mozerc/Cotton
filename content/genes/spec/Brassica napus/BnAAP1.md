## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnAAP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** amino acid permease 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Three amino acid permeases, **BnAAP1**, BnAAP2, and BnAAP6, were identified and characterized. **BnAAP1** and BnAAP6 mediated uptake of neutral and acidic amino acids into Xenopus laevis oocytes at the actual apoplastic substrate concentrations.
   - All three transporters were expressed in leaves and the expression was still detectable during leaf senescence, with **BnAAP1** and BnAAP2 mRNA levels increasing from mature to old leaves.
   - Amino acid permeases are present in senescing leaves of oilseed rape and in some cases are upregulated during senescence.
   - It is possible that both **BnAAP1** and BnAAP2 would become induced at a later stage of silique development as well.
