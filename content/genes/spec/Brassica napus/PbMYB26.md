## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbMYB26</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - PbLAC4-like, activated by **PbMYB26**, related to the degradation of anthocyanin during color fading in pear.
   - Identified **PbMYB26** as a positive regulator of PbLAC4-like. Yeast one-hybrid and dual luciferase assay results showed that **PbMYB26** activated PbLAC4-like expression by directly binding to the PbLAC4-like promoter.
   - The regulator of PbLAC4-like has also been preliminarily analyzed and found that **PbMYB26** could directly bind to the promoter of PbLAC4-like to up-regulate its expression.
   - These results showed that PbLAC4-like, activated by **PbMYB26**, promoted the degradation of anthocyanin in pear. This provided a theoretical reference for regulating the degradation of anthocyanin.
