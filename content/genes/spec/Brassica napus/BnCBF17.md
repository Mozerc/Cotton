## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnCBF17</u>
- **Gene Name:** CBF-like protein CBF17
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cold acclimation and **BnCBF17**-over-expression enhance photosynthetic performance and energy conversion efficiency during long-term growth of Brassica napus under elevated CO2 conditions.
   - The effects of cold acclimation and long-term elevated CO2 on photosynthetic performance of wild-type (WT) and **BnCBF17**-over-expressing line of Brassica napus cv. 
   - Compared with non-acclimated WT, the **BnCBF17**-OE grown at 20 Â°C mimicked the effects of cold acclimation on WT B. napus with respect to compact dwarf phenotype and increased rates of light-saturated CO2 assimilation and photosynthetic electron transport.
   - **BnCBF17**-over-expression and cold acclimation maintain enhanced energy conversion efficiency and reduced sensitivity to feedback-limited photosynthesis during long-term growth of B. napus under elevated CO2.
