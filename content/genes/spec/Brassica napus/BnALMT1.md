## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnALMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Al-activated malate transporter1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **BnALMT1** and BnALMT2 Genes from Rape Encode Aluminum-Activated Malate Transporters That Enhance the Aluminum Resistance of Plant Cells.
   - The expression of these genes was induced in roots, but not shoots, by Al treatment but P deficiency had no effect. Several other cations (lanthanum, ytterbium, and erbium) also increased **BnALMT1** and BnALMT2 expression in the roots.
   - The function of the **BnALMT1** and BnALMT2 proteins was investigated by heterologous expression in cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells and in Xenopus laevis oocytes.
   - Transgenic tobacco cells grew significantly better than control cells following an 18 h treatment with Al, indicating that the expression of **BnALMT1** and BnALMT2 increased the resistance of these plant cells to Al stress. This report demonstrates that homologs of the TaALMT1 gene from wheat perform similar functions in other species.
