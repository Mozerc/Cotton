## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnaC9.SMG7b</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **BnaC9.SMG7b** Functions as a Positive Regulator of the Number of Seeds per Silique in Brassica napus by Regulating the Formation of Functional Female Gametophytes.
   - **BnaC9.SMG7b** plays a role in regulating the formation of functional female gametophyte, thus determining the formation of functional megaspores and then mature ovules.
   - Haplotype analysis in 84 accessions showed that the favorable **BnaC9.SMG7b** alleles are prevalent in modern B. napus germplasms, suggesting that this locus has been a major selection target of B. napus improvement.
   - Natural loss or artificial knockdown of **BnaC9.SMG7b** significantly reduces the number of functional ovules per silique and thus, results in decreased seed number, indicating that qSS.C9 is a positive regulator of NSS in B. napus. Sequence and function analyses show that **BnaC9.SMG7b** experiences a subfunctionalization process that causes loss of function in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, such as in Arabidopsis SMG7.
