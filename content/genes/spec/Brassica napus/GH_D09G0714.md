## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [GH_D09G0714]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhADF6</u>
- **Gene Name:** actin depolymerizing factor 6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhADF6**-mediated actin reorganization is associated with defence against Verticillium dahliae infection in cotton.
   - **GhADF6** binds to actin filaments and possesses actin severing and depolymerizing activities in vitro and in vivo. 
   - By virus-induced gene silencing analysis, the down-regulation of **GhADF6** expression rendered the cotton plants tolerant to V. dahliae infection.
   - **GhADF6** is an active actin depolymerizing and severing protein. The defence-related down-regulation of **GhADF6** was found to augment the abundance of actin filaments and bundles, which was accompanied by enhanced disease tolerance against V. dahliae in cotton.
   - Our findings demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton was reorganized and F-actin abundance was increased on V. dahliae attack. Furthermore, regulating the expression of **GhADF6** was identified to be crucial for this cellular process.
