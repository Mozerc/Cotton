## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnWRI1</u>
- **Gene Name:** AP2/EREBP transcription factor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **BnWRI1** coordinates fatty acid biosynthesis and photosynthesis pathways during oil accumulation in rapeseed.
   - Overexpression of **BnWRI1** increased expression of both marker genes. Further, the nuclear-localized **BnWRI1** protein was found to act as a transcription activator. 
   - **BnWRI1** is co-expressed with genes involved in FA biosynthesis and photosynthesis during seed development
   - Overexpression of **BnWRI1** promotes expression of the FA biosynthesis- and photosynthesis-related genes in seeds.
   - These results suggested that **BnWRI1** may coordinate FA biosynthesis and photosynthesis pathways in developing seeds via directly stimulating expression of GT1-element and/or GCC-box containing genes.
