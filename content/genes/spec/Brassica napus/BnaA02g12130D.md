## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [BnaA02g12130D]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnaFTA2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We revealed that **BnaFTA2** plays a major role in temperature-dependent flowering initiation. 
   - H3K4me3 present in **BnaFTA2** under inductive flowering conditions is reduced at high temperature, suggesting a role for this hallmark of transcriptionally active chromatin in the OSR flowering response to warming.
   - Analysis of the H2A.Z histone variant occupancy at this locus in different Brassica napus varieties produced contrasting results, suggesting the involvement of additional molecular mechanisms in **BnaFTA2** repression at high ambient temperature.Analysis of the H2A.Z histone variant occupancy at this locus in different Brassica napus varieties produced contrasting results, suggesting the involvement of additional molecular mechanisms in **BnaFTA2** repression at high ambient temperature.
   - Our data reveal **BnaFTA2** as a candidate gene with a key role in temperature-dependent flowering control.
