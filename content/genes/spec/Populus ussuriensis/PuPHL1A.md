## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PuPHL1A</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Populus ussuriensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Demonstrated that several nitrate-responsive genes (PuNRT1.1, PuNRT2.4, PuCLC-b, PuNIA2, PuNIR1, and PuNLP1), phosphate-responsive genes (**PuPHL1A** and PuPHL1B), and an iron transporter gene (PuIRT1) were substantiated to be direct targets of PuHox52.
   - Among them, PuNRT1.1, **PuPHL1A**/PuPHL1B, and PuIRT1 were upregulated to relatively higher levels during PuHox52-mediated responses against N deficiency in PuHox52-overexpression lines compared to WT.
   - Our results revealed that PuHox52 directly regulates a master nitrate-responsive gene, PuNRT1.1, two key phosphate-responsive genes, **PuPHL1A** and PuPHL1B, and an iron transporter gene, PuIRT1, after N deprivation, thereby coordinately regulating nitrate, phosphate, and iron uptake under low N condition. 
   - These results indicate that PuHox52 also augments Pi uptake through direct regulation of **PuPHL1A** and PuPHL1B under LN condition.
