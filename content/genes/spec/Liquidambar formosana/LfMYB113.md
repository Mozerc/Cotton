## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LfMYB113</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB transcription factor 113
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Liquidambar formosana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A R2R3-MYB Gene **LfMYB113** is Responsible for Autumn Leaf Coloration in Formosan sweet gum.
   - The expression patterns of **LfMYB113** in four selected phenotypes were different and were positively correlated with leaf anthocyanin content.
   - It was also shown that **LfMYB113** can activate the promoter sequence of LfDFR1 and LfDFR2. Transient overexpression of **LfMYB113** in Nicotiana benthamiana showed strong anthocyanin accumulation and pre-senescence| the latter was confirmed by up-regulation of senescence-associated genes.
   - With the help of gene co-expression network analysis, we have identified **LfMYB113** as a putative regulator in Formosan sweet gum autumn leaf coloration which may regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis, but its function remains to be characterized.
