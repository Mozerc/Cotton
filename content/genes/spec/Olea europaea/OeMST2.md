## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OeMST2</u>
- **Gene Name:** monosaccharide transporter 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Olea europaea*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **OeMST2** Encodes a Monosaccharide Transporter Expressed throughout Olive Fruit Maturation.
   - The encoded protein showed high affinity for D-glucose (Km, 25 Î¼M) and was also able to recognize D-galactose and the analogs 3-O-methyl-D-glucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, but not D-fructose, D-arabinose, sucrose or D-mannitol. Maximal transport activity was high at acidic pH (5.0), and the initial D-[14C]glucose uptake rates were strongly inhibited by the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, confirming that **OeMST2** is a H+/monosaccharide transporter
   - The expression of **OeMST2** was studied during the ripening process. Transcript levels increased during fruit maturation, suggesting that **OeMST2** takes part in the massive accumulation of monosaccharides in olive fruits. Monosaccharide:H+ transport system activity and **OeMST2** expression were negatively regulated by glucose in suspension-cultured cells.
   - Glucose-mediated **OeMST2** repression was impaired by mannoheptulose, suggesting the involvement of a hexokinase-dependent signaling pathway.
