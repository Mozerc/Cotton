## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Ach02g251101.2]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>AcKUP2</u>
- **Gene Name:** K+ transporter KT/HAK/KUP 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Actinidia chinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ethylene-induced potassium transporter **AcKUP2** gene is involved in kiwifruit postharvest ripening.
   - Transcription analysis revealed that **AcKUP2** expression increased rapidly and was maintained at a high level during postharvest maturation, consistent with the trend of K content| **AcKUP2** expression was induced by ethylene, suggesting that **AcKUP2** might play a role in ripening.
   - Found in the **AcKUP2** promoter sequence, and ethylene significantly enhanced the **AcKUP2** promoter activity. Furthermore, we verified that AcERF15, an ethylene response factor, directly binds to the **AcKUP2** promoter to promote its expression.
   - **AcKUP2** may be an important potassium transporter gene which involved in ethylene-regulated kiwifruit postharvest ripening.
   - **AcKUP2**, a member of group II, was located on the plasma membrane, thereby verifying its K+ transporter activity.
