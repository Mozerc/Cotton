## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MKS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Methylketone Synthase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lycopersicon hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We report crystal structures of S. habrochaites **MKS1**, an atypical member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily. Sequence comparisons revealed the **MKS1** catalytic triad, Ala-His-Asn, as divergent to the traditional α/β-hydrolase triad, Ser-His-Asp.
   - Determination of the **MKS1** structure points to a novel enzymatic mechanism dependent upon residues Thr-18 and His-243, confirmed by biochemical assays.
   - We confirmed the importance of this substrate binding mode by substituting several amino acids leading to an alteration in the acyl-chain length preference of **MKS1**.
   - We employ structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays to demonstrate that **MKS1**, unlike enzymes from this hydrolase superfamily, is not an efficient hydrolase but instead catalyzes the decarboxylation of 3-keto acids.
