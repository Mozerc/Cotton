## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Lr67res</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of the wheat multipathogen resistance hexose transporter **Lr67res** is associated with anion fluxes.
   - **Lr67res**-mediated disease resistance was proposed to occur via a dominant-negative interference, whereby the nonfunctional **Lr67res** protein forms inactive transporter complexes via heterodomerization with the functional STP13 protein homoeologs encoded on the A and B genomes of hexaploid wheat
   - **Lr67res** is a mutated hexose-proton symporter, the possibility that uncoupling of protons was responsible for the observed currents was thoroughly investigated and appeared not to be the case.
   - Although more work is required to refine nuances of the **Lr67res** transport mechanism, this study provides detailed characterization of the **Lr67res** function and represents a substantial step toward understanding multipathogen resistance in crops.
