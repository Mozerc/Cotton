## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.08G349200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmFATA2 </u>
- **Gene Name:** acyl–acyl carrier protein thioesterase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The acyl–acyl carrier protein thioesterases GmFATA1 and **GmFATA2 **are essential for fatty acid accumulation and growth in soybean.
   - Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing mutation of Gmfata1 or 2 led to reduced leaf FA content and growth defect at the early seedling stage.
   - The Gmfata1 or 2 mutants had increased composition of the beneficial FA, oleic acid.
   - Overexpression of GmFATA in soybean led to significant increases in leaf FA content by 5.7%, vegetative growth, and seed yield by 26.9%, and seed FA content by 23.2%. Thus, overexpression of GmFATA is an effective strategy to enhance soybean oil content and yield.
