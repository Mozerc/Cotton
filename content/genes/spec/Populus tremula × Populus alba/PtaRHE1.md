## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PtaRHE1</u>
- **Gene Name:** RING-H2 ATL family protein1
- **Genome:** [C9D740]()
- **Species:** *Populus tremula × Populus alba*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PtaRHE1**, a Populus tremula × Populus alba RING-H2 protein of the ATL family, has a regulatory role in secondary phloem fibre development.
   - Within stem secondary vascular tissues, **PtaRHE1** and its corresponding protein are expressed predominantly in the phloem.
   - The downregulation of **PtaRHE1** in poplar by artificial miRNA triggers alterations in phloem fibre patterning, characterized by an increased portion of secondary phloem fibres that have a reduced cell wall thickness and a change in lignin composition, with lower levels of syringyl units as compared with wild-type plants.
   - Several candidate genes possibly associated with the altered phloem fibre phenotype observed in amiR**PtaRHE1** poplar were identified. Altogether, our data suggest a regulatory role for **PtaRHE1** in secondary phloem fibre development.
   - amiR**PtaRHE1** poplars have alteration in the pattern of secondary phloem fibre development.
