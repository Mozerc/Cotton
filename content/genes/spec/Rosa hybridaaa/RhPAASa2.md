## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>RhPAASa2</u>
- **Gene Name:** PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Rosa hybridaaa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Biosynthesis of 2-Phenylethanol in Rose Petals Is Linked to the Expression of One Allele of RhPAAS.
   - One among these loci contributing to the production of 2-phenylethanol, responsible for the characteristic odor of rose, was found to be colocalized with a candidate gene belonging to the 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis pathway: the PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE gene RhPAAS.
   - Our results showed that the RhPAAS gene was the limiting step for the production of 2PE in our progeny.
