## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PsTrxo1</u>
- **Gene Name:** mitochondrial thioredoxin1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pisum sativum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Response of mitochondrial thioredoxin **PsTrxo1**, antioxidant enzymes, and respiration to salinity in pea leaves.
   - To explore the participation of mitochondrial **PsTrxo1**, Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), peroxiredoxin (PsPrxII F), and alternative oxidase (AOX) under salt stress, their transcriptional and protein levels were analysed in pea plants growing under 150 mM NaCl for a short and a long period.
   - **PsTrxo1** has recently been described as a protein with a dual targeting to pea mitochondria and the nucleus, and several proteins have been described as its targets, including PrxII F and AOX.
   - The results support a role for **PsTrxo1** as a component of the defence system induced by NaCl in pea mitochondria, providing the cell with a mechanism by which it can respond to changing environment protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress together with Mn-SOD, AOX, and PrxII F.
