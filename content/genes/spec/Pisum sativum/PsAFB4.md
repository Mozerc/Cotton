## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PsAFB4</u>
- **Gene Name:** TIR1/AFB 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pisum sativum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The pea **PsAFB4** mutant ramosus 2 has increased shoot branching, shorter internodes, and reduced shoot and root dry weights.
   - PsAFB6 and **PsAFB4** genes were expressed widely throughout the pea plant but with varying transcript Â­abundance patterns depending on the tissue type and developmental stage, similar to what was previously reported for PsTIR1a, PsTIR1b, and PsAFB2.
   - These data suggest that the auxin receptor **PsAFB4** influences both vegetative and reproductive traits in pea.
