## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Medtr7g029760]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NCR169</u>
- **Gene Name:** nodule-specific cysteine-rich 169
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Widely conserved AHL transcription factors are essential for NCR gene (**NCR169**) expression and nodule development in Medicago.
   - Introduction of the Medicago truncatula **NCR169** gene under its own promoter into soybean roots resulted in its nodule-specific expression, leading to bacteroid changes associated with terminal differentiation.
   - Whereas mutation of **NCR169** arrested bacteroid development at a late stage, the absence of MtAHL1 or MtAHL2 completely blocked bacteroid differentiation indicating that they also regulate other NCR genes required for the development of nitrogen-fixing nodules.
   - **NCR169**-induced increase in the size of soybean bacteroids is in line with the role of **NCR169** in M. truncatula, confirming that the **NCR169** peptide is expressed in and can function in soybean nodules.
   - **NCR169** was induced in the cell layers in which bacteroid elongation was most pronounced, and high expression persisted throughout the nitrogen-fixing nodule zone. 
   - Our results provide evidence for an essential role of **NCR169** in the differentiation and persistence of nitrogen fixing bacteroids in M. truncatula.
