## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Medtr6g007687]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtZIP14</u>
- **Gene Name:** Zn-regulated iron-regulated transporter-like protein 14
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Suggesting that increased colonization by the AM fungus is associated with increased expression of **MtZIP14**
   - The putative Zn transporter gene **MtZIP14** was markedly up-regulated in M. truncatula roots when colonized by Rhizophagus irregularis.
   - **MtZIP14** restored yeast growth under low Zn availability. Loss-of-function mutant plants (**MtZIP14**) had reduced shoot biomass compared to the wild-type when colonized by AM fungi and grown under low and sufficient soil Zn concentration| at high soil Zn concentration, there were no genotypic differences in shoot biomass.
   - Loss of **MtZIP14** function negatively affected the colonization of the roots by R. irregularis suggesting a role for the gene in maintaining the plant−fungal association.
   - The expression of **MtZIP14** was not down-regulated in AM-colonized plants when Zn was in high supply, which correlates with Zn isotope data in tomato showing that the mycorrhizal pathway of Zn uptake is not suppressed at high soil Zn concentrations, and is similar regardless of available Zn in the soil.
