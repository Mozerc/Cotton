## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Medtr6g087980]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtRac1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we found that small GTPases (**MtRac1**/MtROP9 and its homologs) are required for root hair development and rhizobial infection in Medicago truncatula.
   - Phosphorylated MtRopGEF2 can activate **MtRac1**. Activated **MtRac1** was found to localize at the tips of root hairs and to strongly interact with LYK3 and NFP.
   - Found that the activated form of **MtRac1** strongly interacts with LYK3 and NFP and is polarly distributed at the root hair tips and rhizobial infection sites.
   - Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that **MtRac1**, LYK3, and NFP form a polarly localized receptor complex that regulates root hair deformation during rhizobial infection.
