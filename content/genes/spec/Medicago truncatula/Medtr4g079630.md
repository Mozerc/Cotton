## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Medtr4g079630]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtCLE12</u>
- **Gene Name:** CLAVATA3/ESR (CLE)-related protein 12
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Root growth inhibition was detected when **MtCLE12** was ectopically expressed in wild-type roots or synthetic CLE12 peptide was applied exogenously.
   - We found that the up-regulation of MtEFD and MtRR8 caused by overexpressing **MtCLE12** is SUNN-dependent.
   - **MtCLE12** overexpression or the exogenous application of its synthetic peptide inhibits root elongation.
   - These results suggest that MtEFD and type A response regulators such as MtRR4 and MtRR8 function downstream of **MtCLE12** peptide signaling during AON.
