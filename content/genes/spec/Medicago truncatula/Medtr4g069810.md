## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Medtr4g069810]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtST1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Specific Tissue 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Three members of Medicago truncatula ST family are ubiquitous during development and modulated by nutritional status (**MtST1**) and dehydration (MtST2 and MtST3).
   - The ST1, ST2 and ST3 transcripts accumulated in most of the organs and developmental stages analysed - decreasing with age - and expression was higher in the roots than in the aerial parts and more abundant in light-grown plants.
   - The effect of the different treatments on transcript accumulation indicated that ST1 behaved differently from ST2 and ST3, mainly in response to several hormones and dehydration treatments (NaCl or mannitol), upon which ST1 transcript levels decreased and ST2 and ST3 levels increased.
   - The ST1 protein was located in the cell wall whereas ST2 and ST3 were present both in the cytoplasm and in the cell wall.
   - ST1 would participate in processes affected by nutritional status, while ST2 and ST3 seem to act when plants are challenged with abiotic stresses related to water stress and in physiologically controlled desiccation processes such as the seed maturation.
