## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MtrunA17_Chr3g0137174]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtEFD2</u>
- **Gene Name:** ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR REQUIRED FOR NODULE DIFFERENTIATION 2
- **Genome:** [Mt5.0 genome browser (https://medicago.toulouse.inra.fr/MtrunA17r5.0-ANR/)]()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - MtEFD and **MtEFD2**: Two transcription factors with distinct neofunctionalization in symbiotic nodule development.
   - A domain swap experiment showed that **MtEFD2** differs from MtEFD by its C-terminal fraction outside the DNA binding domain. Furthermore, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) mutagenesis of **MtEFD2** led to a reduction in the number of nodules formed in Mtefd-1, with downregulation of a set of genes, including notably NUCLEAR FACTOR-YA1 (MtNF-YA1) and MtNF-YB16, which are essential for nodule meristem establishment.
   - Conclude that nitrogen-fixing symbiosis recruited two proteins originally expressed in roots, MtEFD and **MtEFD2**, with distinct functions and neofunctionalization processes for each of them.
   - MtEFD and **MtEFD2**, which exhibit distinct but overlapping expression profiles, could both be involved in the control of nodulation.
