## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Medtr5g093170.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtNRT1.3</u>
- **Gene Name:** nitrate transporter NRT1.3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of a dual-affinity nitrate transporter **MtNRT1.3** in the model legume Medicago truncatula.
   - Functional characterization in Xenopus oocytes using both electrophysiological and 15NO3– uptake approaches showed that Medtr5g093170.1, named **MtNRT1.3**, encodes a dual-affinity NO3– transporter similar to the AtNRT1.1 ‘transceptor’ in Arabidopsis.
   - **MtNRT1.3** expression is developmentally regulated in roots, with increasing expression after completion of germination in N-free medium.
   - **MtNRT1.3** is environmentally up-regulated by the absence of NO3– and down-regulated by the addition of the ion to the roots. Split-root experiments showed that the increased expression stimulated by the absence of NO3– was not the result of a systemic signalling of plant N status.
   - The results suggest that **MtNRT1.3** is involved in the response to N limitation, which increases the ability of the plant to acquire NO3– under N-limiting conditions.
