## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtABCG10</u>
- **Gene Name:** ATP-binding cassette G subfamily
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The experiments described here demonstrated that the level of Medicago truncatula ABCG10 (**MtABCG10**) mRNA was elevated following application of fungal oligosaccharides to plant roots.
   - Spatial expression pattern analysis with a reporter gene revealed that the **MtABCG10** promoter was active in various organs, mostly within their vascular tissues.
   - Silencing of **MtABCG10** in hairy roots resulted in lower accumulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway-derived medicarpin and its precursors.
   - PCR-based experiments indicated that infection with Fusarium oxysporum, a root-infecting pathogen, progressed faster in **MtABCG10**-silenced composite plants (consisting of wild-type shoots on transgenic roots) than in the corresponding controls.
