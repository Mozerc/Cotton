## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TgCYP76AE2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Thapsia garganica cytochrome P450
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Thapsia garganica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We present the putative second step in thapsigargin biosynthesis, by showing that the cytochrome P450 **TgCYP76AE2**, transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana, converts epikunzeaol into epidihydrocostunolide.
   - Transcripts from TgTPS2 (epikunzeaol synthase) and **TgCYP76AE2** in roots were found only in the epithelial cells lining these secretory ducts. This emphasizes the involvement of these cells in the biosynthesis of thapsigargin.
   - **TgCYP76AE2** was found to catalyze the oxidations that lead to the formation of a lactone ring, thereby converting epikunzeaol into epidihydrocostunolide.
   - **TgCYP76AE2** is suggested to catalyze three hydroxylations to obtain epidihydrocostunolide.
