## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Cluster 8422.10600]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NsMYB1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nitraria sibirica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional R2R3-MYB transcription factor **NsMYB1**, regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis, was relative to the fruit color differentiation in Nitraria sibirica Pall.
   - In the unigenes of the transcript factor MYB and bHLH, relative to anthocyanin, only **NsMYB1** (Cluster 8422.10600), was high-expression and up-expression in the peels of BF. **NsMYB1** encoded the same length protein with four amino acid differences in the RF and BF, and both contained the intact DNA, HTH-MYB and SANT domains.
   - **NsMYB1** was close to the AtMYB114, AtMYB113 and AtPAP1, regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis, in phylogenetic relationship. 
   - Both **NsMYB1**r and **NsMYB1**b could promote the transcript of the structural genes, and induced the anthocyanin accumulation in all tissues of transgenic tobacco.
