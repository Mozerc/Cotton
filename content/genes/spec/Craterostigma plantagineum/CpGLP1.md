## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CpGLP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** germin-like protein 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Craterostigma plantagineum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The dehydration- and ABA-inducible germin-like protein **CpGLP1** from Craterostigma plantagineum has SOD activity and may contribute to cell wall integrity during desiccation.
   - **CpGLP1** transcripts accumulate in leaves in response to dehydration and ABA, and mannitol treatments transiently induce **CpGLP1** transcript accumulation supporting the participation of **CpGLP1** in desiccation-related processes. 
   - **CpGLP1** protein from cell wall protein extracts followed transcript accumulation and protein preparations from bacteria overexpressing **CpGLP1** showed SOD activity.
   - **CpGLP1** belongs to the large group of germin-like proteins and comprises a cell wall-localized protein which has superoxide dismutase activity and may contribute towards ROS metabolism and cell wall folding during desiccation.
