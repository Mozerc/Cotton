## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SrKAH</u>
- **Gene Name:** kaurenoic acid hydroxylase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Stevia rebaudiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of SrDXS1 and **SrKAH** enhances steviol glycosides content in transgenic Stevia plants.
   - Overexpressed the Stevia 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1 (SrDXS1) and kaurenoic acid hydroxylase (**SrKAH**), both of which are required for SGs biosynthesis.
   - Compared to control plants, the total SGs content in SrDXS1- and **SrKAH**-overexpressing transgenic lines were enhanced by up to 42–54% and 67–88%, respectively, showing a positive correlation with the expression levels of SrDXS1 and **SrKAH**.
   - Hence, our results show that both SrDXS1 and **SrKAH** overexpression could increase SGs content in transgenic Stevia without changing the abundance of other metabolites or having any detrimental effects on their growth and development.
