## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Pbr029685.2]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbrGAUT22</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus bretschneideri*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Elucidation of the GAUT gene family in eight Rosaceae species and function analysis of **PbrGAUT22** in pear pollen tube growth.
   - The phylogenetic relationship and evolutionary history of the GAUT gene family were identified in 8 Rosaseae species. **PbrGAUT22** was involved in controlling pollen tube growth by regulating the content of pectins.
   - **PbrGAUT22** was localized to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Knockdown of **PbrGAUT22** expression in pollen tubes caused the decrease of pectin content and inhibited pear pollen tubes growth. 
   - Taken together, we investigated the identification and evolution of the GAUT gene family in Rosaceae species, and found that **PbrGAUT22** played an essential role in the synthesis of pectin and the growth of pear pollen tubes.
