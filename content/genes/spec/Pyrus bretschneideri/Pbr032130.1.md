## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Pbr032130.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbTST4</u>
- **Gene Name:** tonoplast membrane sugar transporter
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus bretschneideri*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Furthermore, PbCPK28 interacts with and phosphorylates **PbTST4**, a proton antiporter, thereby coupling the sugar import into the vacuole with proton export.
   - We demonstrated that residues S277 and S314 of **PbTST4** are crucial for its function. 
   - Our data demonstrated that PbCPK28 could interact with and phosphorylate the vacuolar sugar transporter **PbTST4**, as well as vacuolar hydrogen proton pump PbVHA-A1, which could provide proton motive forces for **PbTST4** and promote transport of excess sugars into vacuoles for storage, eventually increasing sugar accumulation during pear fruit development.
   - Together, our work identifies an agriculturally important natural variation and an important regulatory network, allowing genetic improvement of fruit sugar contents in pears through modulation of PbCPK28 expression and phosphorylation of **PbTST4** and PbVHA-A1.
