## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Pbr034839.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbCPK28</u>
- **Gene Name:** calcium-dependent protein kinase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus bretschneideri*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Natural variations in the **PbCPK28** promoter regulate sugar content through interaction with PbTST4 and PbVHA-A1 in pear.
   - Identified a calcium-dependent protein kinase (**PbCPK28**), which is located on LG15 and is present within a selective sweep region, thus linked to the quantitative trait loci for soluble solids.
   - Elevated expression of **PbCPK28** resulted in significantly increased fructose levels in pear fruits. Furthermore, **PbCPK28** interacts with and phosphorylates PbTST4, a proton antiporter, thereby coupling the sugar import into the vacuole with proton export.
   - **PbCPK28** interacts with and phosphorylates the vacuolar hydrogen proton pump PbVHA-A1, which could provide proton motive forces for PbTST4. 
   - Together, our work identifies an agriculturally important natural variation and an important regulatory network, allowing genetic improvement of fruit sugar contents in pears through modulation of **PbCPK28** expression and phosphorylation of PbTST4 and PbVHA-A1.
