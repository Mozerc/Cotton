## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbMYB9</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB9 transcription factor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus bretschneideri*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Among these MYB-like genes, the specific functions of two novel MYB TFs, designated as PbMYB10b and **PbMYB9**, were further verified by both overexpression and RNAi transient assays.
   - **PbMYB9**, a TT2-type MYB, not only acted as the specific activator of the proanthocyanidin pathway by activating the PbANR promoter, but also induced the synthesis of anthocyanins and flavonols by binding the PbUFGT1 promoter in pear fruits.
   - PbMYB10b was identified as the activator of the anthocyanin and PA pathways, and **PbMYB9** as the activator of the PA, anthocyanin, and flavonol pathways.
   - **PbMYB9** is an essential activator of the PA, anthocyanin, and flavonol pathways.
