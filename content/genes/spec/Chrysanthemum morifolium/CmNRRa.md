## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CmNRRa</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Chrysanthemum morifolium*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CmNRRa**, an orthologous gene of OsNRRa that regulates root growth in response to nutrient stress in rice, was identified from Chrysanthemum and its role in flowering time was studied.
   - **CmNRRa** was strongly expressed in flower buds and peduncles, suggesting that **CmNRRa** plays a regulatory role in floral development.
   - **CmNRRa**-RNAi transgenic plants flowered 40â€“64 days earlier, while **CmNRRa**-overexpressing plants exhibited a delayed flowering phenotype. These results revealed a negative effect of **CmNRRa** on flowering time modulation. 
   - **CmNRRa** expression levels in the transgenic plants were assayed by real-time RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. The transgenic plants showed altered flowering times compared with nontransgenic plants.
