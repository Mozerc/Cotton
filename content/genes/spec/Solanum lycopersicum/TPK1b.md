## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TPK1b</u>
- **Gene Name:** TOMATO PROTEIN KINASE 1b
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TPK1b**, a key regulator of tomato defense against B. cinerea and M. sexta, was phosphorylated by PORK1.
   - Here, we describe the identification of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) PEPR1/2 ORTHOLOG RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 (PORK1) as the TOMATO PROTEIN KINASE1b (**TPK1b**) interacting protein and demonstrate its biological functions in systemin signaling and tomato immune responses.
   - Interestingly, wounding- and systemin-induced phosphorylation of **TPK1b** was attenuated when PORK1 expression was suppressed.
   - Our data suggest that resistance to B. cinerea and M. sexta is dependent on PORK1-mediated responses to systemin and subsequent phosphorylation of **TPK1b**. Altogether, PORK1 regulates tomato systemin, wounding, and immune responses.
