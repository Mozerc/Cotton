## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlSAMT|SAMT</u>
- **Gene Name:** salicylic acid methyltransferase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Silencing of **SlSAMT|SAMT** led to a major reduction in **SlSAMT|SAMT** expression and MeSA emission upon herbivory by spider mites, without affecting the induced emission of other volatiles (terpenoids).
   - **SlSAMT|SAMT** expression was slightly induced in hp**SlSAMT|SAMT** lines upon spider-mite infestation| however, this induction was severely reduced compared with the controls.
   - **SlSAMT|SAMT** silencing reduces susceptibility of tomato to Fusarium wilt.
   - These findings are supportive of a major role for MeSA in this indirect defence response of tomato. **SlSAMT|SAMT**-silenced tomato plants were less susceptible to a virulent strain of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, indicating that the direct defense responses in the roots are also affected in these plants.
