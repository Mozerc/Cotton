## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc07g005650]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>WRKY32</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY transcription factor 32
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The transcription factor **WRKY32** affects tomato fruit colour by regulating YELLOW FRUITED-TOMATO 1, a core component of ethylene signal transduction.
   - Based on bioinformatic analysis, yeast one hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we report that transcription factor **WRKY32** regulates tomato fruit colour formation.
   - In tomato fruits of **WRKY32**-RNAi generated lines, ethylene signalling was reduced, leading to a suppression in ethylene emission, a delay in chromoplast development, decreased carotenoid accumulation, and a yellow fruit phenotype.
   - Describe the characterization of **WRKY32**, a member of the WRKY TF family, and the mechanism by which it affects ripening and fruit colour formation through its interaction with the YFT1 promoter.
