## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlMKK4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Mitogen-activated protein kinase 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tomato SlMKK2 and **SlMKK4** contribute to disease resistance against Botrytis cinerea.
   - qRT-PCR analyses revealed that expression of SlMKK2 and **SlMKK4** was strongly induced by B. cinerea and by jasmonic acid and ethylene precursor 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid.
   - Silencing of SlMKK2 or **SlMKK4** resulted in reduced resistance to B. cinerea, increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species and attenuated expression of defense genes after infection of B. cinerea in tomato plants.
   - VIGS-based knockdown of SlMKK2 and **SlMKK4** expression in tomato and gain-of-function transient expression of constitutively active phosphomimicking forms SlMKK2DD and SlMKK2DD in N. benthamiana demonstrate that both SlMKK2 and **SlMKK4** function as positive regulators of defense response against B. cinerea.
