## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LeIRT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** iron-regulated transporter 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - LeFRO1 encoding an Fe(III)-chelate reductase protein was isolated from the tomato genome. We show that expression of LeFRO1 in yeast increases Fe(III)-chelate reductase activity. In a transient expression analysis we found that LeFRO1 protein was targeted on the plasma membrane. 
   - The differential expression of LeFRO1 and **LeIRT1** (an iron-regulated metal transporter gene in tomato) in roots of T3238fer under iron-deficient and -sufficient conditions suggests that the FER gene may regulate expression of LeFRO1 more directly than that of **LeIRT1** in tomato roots.
   - The growth defect of an iron uptake-deficient yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant was complemented by **LeIRT1** and LeIRT2 when ligated to a yeast expression plasmid.
   - The enhanced expression of LeFRO1, **LeIRT1** and LeNRAMP1 under the culture condition with high pH or on agar media with NO(3) (-) as the sole N source might be a consequence of reduced iron availability in the solution or agar medium at high pH.
