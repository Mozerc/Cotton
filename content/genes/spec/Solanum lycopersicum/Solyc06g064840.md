## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc06g064840]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlMBP3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SlMBP3** was preferentially expressed in the locular tissue of fruit and the seed coat combined with the endoderm.
   - Consistent with where **SlMBP3** is expressed, the **SlMBP3**-knockout/down lines showed non-liquefied locular tissues and increased number of seed hairs than the wild type (WT).
   - The early cell degradation of the locular tissue was not observed in the fruits of the **SlMBP3**-knockout/down lines, and the cells were elongated like placental cells resulting in non-liquefied locular tissues.
   - In the seed coat of the **SlMBP3**-knockout/down lines, tomato trichome-formation-related genes such as MYB genes containing R2 and R3 repeats (R2R3-MYB) transcription factor SlMYB75, B-type cyclin SlCycB2 and Homeodomain Leucine Zipper (HD-Zip) IV transcription factor Woolly were downregulated.
   - Demonstrate that **SlMBP3** is involved in the liquefaction of the locular tissue through the modification of cell development and degradation processes and seed hair formation in tomato fruits, and the **SlMBP3** knockout/down results in normal-sized fruit with increased dry matter content.
