## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc08g005400.2]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlCMT4</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis of **SlCMT4** causes changes in plant architecture and reproductive organs in tomato.
   - CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of **SlCMT4** induced the expression of two pollen-specific genes (PMEI and PRALF) that suppressed the development of pollen wall and pollen tube elongation, which is responsible for irregular and defective pollen.
   - A reduction of methylation was also observed in a 2-kp region of the IMA and LOXB promoters in the **SlCMT4**-mutant fruits, indicating that the hypermethylation status of the CHH context is critical for the inhibition of IMA and LOXB promoter activity.
   - Our results show that **SlCMT4** is required for normal development of tomato vegetative and reproductive organs.
