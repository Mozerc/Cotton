## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc04g005020]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlWD40</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SlWD40** overexpression and RNAi lines exhibited substantially accelerated and delayed ripening phenotypes compared with the wild type, respectively.
   - A comparative transcriptomics and eQTL approach identifies **SlWD40** as a tomato fruit ripening regulator.
   - Moreover, transcriptome analysis of these transgenics revealed that expression patterns of ethylene biosynthesis genes, phytoene synthase, pectate lyase, and branched chain amino transferase 2, in **SlWD40**-RNAi lines were similar to those of rin and nor fruits, which further demonstrated that **SlWD40** may act as an important ripening regulator in conjunction with RIN and NOR.
   - The co-expression networks, metabolome and transcriptome analysis indicated that **SlWD40** acted as a positive regulator of tomato ripening with the key ripening TFs such as RIN, NOR, AP2a, and SlWRKYs.
