## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlMBP21</u>
- **Gene Name:** MADS-box protein 21
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The MADS-Box Gene **SlMBP21** Regulates Sepal Size Mediated by Ethylene and Auxin in Tomato.
   - To explore how **SlMBP21** regulates sepal size, we compared the transcriptomes of sepals between **SlMBP21**-RNAi and the wild type by RNA sequencing and found that the differentially expressed genes were dominantly related to cell expansion, ethylene and auxin, and photosynthesis
   - **SlMBP21** negatively regulated cell expansion to control sepal size, and ethylene and auxin may mediate this process.
   - These results suggested that **SlMBP21** was a novel factor involved in organ size control. Moreover, our study provided potential application value for improving fruit set.
