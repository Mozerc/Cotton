## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlCYP707A1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase CYP707A1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Abscisic acid levels in tomato ovaries are regulated by LeNCED1 and **SlCYP707A1**.
   - The remarkably large increase we found in **SlCYP707A1** mRNA levels suggests a strong induction of ABA 8′-hydroxylation after pollination.
   - An important regulator of ABA biosynthesis in tomato is 9-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenase (LeNCED1), whose mRNA level in ovaries is reduced after pollination. The increased catabolism is likely caused by strong induction of one of four newly identified putative (+)ABA 8′-hydroxylase genes. This gene was named **SlCYP707A1** and is expressed specifically in ovules and placenta.
   - The increase in **SlCYP707A1** levels cannot be caused by a lower content of ABA, because this gene is also positively regulated by ABA.
