## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc03g083100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlIQD21a</u>
- **Gene Name:** IQ67 DOMAIN 21
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Microtubule-associated protein SlMAP70 interacts with IQ67-domain protein **SlIQD21a** to regulate fruit shape in tomato.
   - SlMAP70-1–3 and **SlIQD21a** are highly expressed during fruit initiation, which relates to the dramatic microtubule pattern rearrangements throughout this developmental stage of tomato fruits.
   - Transgenic tomato lines overexpressing SlMAP70-1 or **SlIQD21a** produced elongated fruits with reduced cell circularity and microtubule anisotropy, while their loss-of-function mutants showed the opposite phenotype, harboring flatter fruits. Fruits were further elongated in plants coexpressing both SlMAP70-1 and **SlIQD21a**
   - Demonstrated that SlMAP70s and **SlIQD21a** physically interact and that the elongated fruit phenotype is likely due to microtubule stabilization induced by the SlMAP70–**SlIQD21a** interaction.
