## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlCPTBP</u>
- **Gene Name:** CPT-binding protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Designated as CPT-binding protein (**SlCPTBP**), which is a close homolog of the human Nogo-B receptor.
   - Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that SlCPT3 and its partner protein interact in vivo and that both SlCPT3 and **SlCPTBP** are required to complement the growth defects and dolichol deficiency of the yeast dolichol mutant, rer2âˆ†.
   - Co-expression of SlCPT3 and **SlCPTBP** in yeast and in E. coli confirmed that dolichol synthase activity strictly requires both proteins.
   - Organelle isolation and in vivo localization of fluorescent protein fusions showed that both SlCPT3 and **SlCPTBP** localize to the ER, the site of dolichol accumulation and synthesis in eukaryotes.
