## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>phyB1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We report that SlphyF acts as a red/far-red light reversible low fluence sensor, likely through the formation of heterodimers with Sl**phyB1** and SlphyB2.
   - Our data further suggest that phyB2 requires the presence of either **phyB1** or phyF during seedling de-etiolation in red light, probably via heterodimerization, while **phyB1** homodimers are required and sufficient to suppress hypocotyl elongation in red light.
   - During the end-of-day far-red response, phyF works additively with **phyB1** and phyB2.
   - The response to photoperiod is redundantly regulated by **phyB1** and phyF.
