## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LeHT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** hexose transporter 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Involvement of the Hexose Transporter Gene **LeHT1** and of Sugars in Resistance of Tomato to Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus.
   - Previously, we demonstrated that the hexose transporter gene **LeHT1** is up-regulated upon infection in R plants and its silencing in R plants (RH) leads to the collapse of resistance.
   - In R plants where **LeHT1** has been silenced , the hexose transporter is not expressed, and hence hexoses cannot be internalized into the cell in order to act as defense signaling molecules, likely decreasing the PTM effect, and inducing the collapse of resistance.
   - These results demonstrate the cardinal role of **LeHT1** in regulating sugar content in R plants. In all tomato plants, the hexose content correlated with the expression level of **LeHT1**.
