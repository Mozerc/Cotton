## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc03g121880]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlPP2C5</u>
- **Gene Name:** type 2C protein phosphatase5
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression and RNAi of **SlPP2C5** affects fruit ripening onset and quality.
   - These results suggest that **SlPP2C5**-mediated ABA signaling affects the expressions of transcription factors, which regulates the expressions of ripening-related genes, thereby affecting the fruit ripening onset.
   - Tomato **SlPP2C5** Is Involved in the Regulation of Fruit Development and Ripening.
   - lPP2C5 is involved in the regulation of fruit size, fruit shape, pericarp thickness and seed number, although the underlying mechanism is not very clear.
