## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>bk2-ref|BK2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Brittle stalk 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A spontaneous maize mutant, brittle stalk-2 (**bk2-ref|BK2**), exhibits dramatically reduced tissue mechanical strength.
   - The **bk2-ref|BK2** gene was expressed in the stalk, husk, root, and leaf tissues, but not in the embryo, endosperm, pollen, silk, or other tissues with comparatively few or no secondary cell wall containing cells. 
   - In agreement with its role in secondary wall formation, the expression pattern of the **bk2-ref|BK2** gene was very similar to that of the ZmCesA10, ZmCesA11, and ZmCesA12 genes, which are known to be involved in secondary wall formation. 
   - Our results demonstrate that mutations in the **bk2-ref|BK2** gene affect stalk strength in maize by interfering with the deposition of cellulose in the secondary cell wall in fiber cells.
