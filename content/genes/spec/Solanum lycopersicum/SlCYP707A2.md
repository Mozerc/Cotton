## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlCYP707A2</u>
- **Gene Name:** abscisic acid 8'-hydroxylase CYP707A2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - SlNCED1 and **SlCYP707A2**: key genes involved in ABA metabolism during tomato fruit ripening.
   - ABA accumulation and SlNCED1transcript levels in the SlNCED1-RNAi-treated fruit were downregulated to 21% and 19% of those in control fruit, respectively, but upregulated in **SlCYP707A2**-RNAi-treated fruit.
   - Silencing SlNCED1 or **SlCYP707A2** by VIGS significantly altered the transcripts of a set of both ABA-responsive and ripening-related genes, including ABA-signalling genes (PYL1, PP2C1, and SnRK2.2), lycopene-synthesis genes (SlBcyc, SlPSY1 and SlPDS), and cell wall-degrading genes (SlPG1, SlEXP, and SlXET) during ripening.
   - These data indicate that SlNCED1 and **SlCYP707A2** are key genes in the regulation of ABA synthesis and catabolism, and are involved in fruit ripening as positive and negative regulators, respectively.
