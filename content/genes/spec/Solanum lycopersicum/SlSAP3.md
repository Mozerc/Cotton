## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlSAP3</u>
- **Gene Name:** stress-associated protein 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tomato **SlSAP3**, a member of the stress-associated protein family, is a positive regulator of immunity against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000.
   - Silencing of **SlSAP3** attenuated while overexpression of **SlSAP3** in transgenic tomato increased immunity to Pst DC3000, accompanied with reduced and increased Pst DC3000-induced expression of SA signalling and defence genes, respectively.
   - Flg22-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and expression of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) marker genes SlPTI5 and SlLRR22 were strengthened in **SlSAP3**-OE plants but were weakened in **SlSAP3**-silenced plants.
   - **SlSAP3** interacted with two SlBOBs and the A20 domain in **SlSAP3** is critical for the **SlSAP3**-SlBOB1 interaction. Silencing of SlBOB1 and co-silencing of all three SlBOB genes conferred increased resistance to Pst DC3000, accompanied with increased Pst DC3000-induced expression of SA signalling and defence genes.
   - These data demonstrate that **SlSAP3** acts as a positive regulator of immunity against Pst DC3000 in tomato through the SA signalling and that **SlSAP3** may exert its function in immunity by interacting with other proteins such as SlBOBs, which act as negative regulators of immunity against Pst DC3000 in tomato.
