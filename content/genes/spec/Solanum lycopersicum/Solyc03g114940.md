## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc03g114940]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlKLUH</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Differential expression of **SlKLUH** controlling fruit and seed weight is associated with changes in lipid metabolism and photosynthesis-related genes.
   - Found that higher expression of **SlKLUH** increased cell proliferation in the pericarp within 5 d post-anthesis in tomato near-isogenic lines.
   - Differential gene expression analyses showed that lower expression of **SlKLUH** was associated with increased expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism.
   - **SlKLUH** regulates fruit and seed weight which is associated with altered lipid metabolism. The results expand our understanding of fruit and seed weight regulation and offer a valuable resource for functional studies of candidate genes putatively involved in regulation of organ size in tomato and other crops.
