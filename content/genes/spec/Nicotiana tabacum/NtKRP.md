## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NtKRP</u>
- **Gene Name:** kinesin-related protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ribosomal protein NtRPL17 interacts with kinesin-12 family protein **NtKRP** and functions in the regulation of embryo/seed size and radicle growth.
   - A novel motor protein belonging to the kinesin-12 family, **NtKRP**, displays critical roles in regulating embryo and seed size establishment.
   - These phenotypes are similar to that in **NtKRP**-silenced embryos/seeds, indicating that **NtKRP** and NtRPL17 function as partners in the same regulatory pathway during seed development and specifically regulate cell cycle progression to control embryo/seed size.
   - Confirmation of the interaction between **NtKRP** and NtRPL17 and their co-function in the control of the cell cycle also suggests that the mechanism might be conserved in both plants and animals.
