## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NtMPK4</u>
- **Gene Name:** mitogen-activated protein kinase4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Silencing of **NtMPK4** impairs CO2-induced stomatal closure, activation of anion channels and cytosolic Ca2+signals in Nicotiana tabacum guard cells.
   - Here, the role of **NtMPK4** in light-induced stomatal opening was studied, as silencing of this MAP kinase stimulates stomatal opening. 
   - Both the darkness-induced anion channel activation and Ca2+ signals were repressed in **NtMPK4**-silenced guard cells. These data show that CO2 and darkness can activate anion channels in a Ca2+-independent manner, but the anion channel activity is enhanced by parallel increases in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration.
   - **NtMPK4** plays an essential role in CO2- and darkness-induced activation of guard-cell anion channels, through Ca2+-independent as well as Ca2+-dependent signalling pathways.
