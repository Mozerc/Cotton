## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ROX1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Putative ROX1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ROX1**, a gene induced by rolB, is involved in procambial cell proliferation and xylem differentiation in tobacco stamen.
   - Here we isolated a tobacco gene, **ROX1**, acting downstream of rolB. We show that plants with reduced levels of **ROX1** mRNA, due to the expression of a 35S-driven **ROX1**-antisense construct, have flowers with stamens and pistils longer than normal because of an increased number of cells.
   - Localized expression of rolB in anthers results in overexpression of **ROX1** and reduced growth of stamens, due to a reduced number of cells.
   - The sequence of **ROX1** shares a conserved element with a number of plant genes, including TED3, which is involved in xylem differentiation. These results point to a role of **ROX1** in the balance between proliferation of procambial cells and xylem differentiation during stamen development.
