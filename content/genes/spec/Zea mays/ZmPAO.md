## Functional Descriptions:
   - Maize (Zea mays) PAO (**ZmPAO**) is a developmentally regulated flavoprotein abundant in primary and secondary cell walls of several tissues.
   - In this study, we investigated the effect of wounding on **ZmPAO** gene expression in the outer tissues of the maize mesocotyl and provide evidence that **ZmPAO** enzyme activity, protein, and mRNA levels increased in response to wounding as well as jasmonic acid treatment.
   - Histochemically detected **ZmPAO** activity especially intensified in the epidermis and in the wound periderm, suggesting a tissue-specific involvement of **ZmPAO** in wound healing. The role played by **ZmPAO**-derived H2O2 production in peroxidase-mediated wall stiffening events was further investigated by exploiting the in vivo use of N-prenylagmatine (G3), a selective and powerful **ZmPAO** inhibitor, representing a reliable diagnostic tool in discriminating **ZmPAO**-mediated H2O2 production from that generated by peroxidase, oxalate oxidase, or by NADPH oxidase activity.
   - **ZmPAO** ectopic expression in the cell wall of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants strongly enhanced lignosuberization along the wound periderm, providing evidence for a causal relationship between PAO and peroxidase-mediated events during wound healing.
