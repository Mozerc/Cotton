## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb323140]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmPDRP2</u>
- **Gene Name:** PDK regulatory protein2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A primarily immuno-based approach was used to show that PDRP1 is strictly expressed in mesophyll cells and PDRP2 is strictly expressed in bundle sheath strand cells (BSCs).
   - A third line of evidence needed was an unequivocal demonstration that C4 PPDK, the putative regulatory target for PDRP2, was present at substantial levels in BSC chloroplasts.
   - In order to resolve the precise function of the PDRP2 isoform in maize leaves, it will be necessary to establish if, indeed, the enzyme lacks PPT activity in vivo and which is the focus of future experiments.
   - These findings suggest a functional role for PDRP2 in C4 photosynthesis which is distinctly different from the C4 role which PDRP1 fulfills in MCs.
