## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb121470]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmC4-NADP-ME|Zmme3</u>
- **Gene Name:** NADP malic enzyme3
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The results clearly show that **ZmC4-NADP-ME|Zmme3** is the only one modulated by redox status, and that its oxidation produces a conformational change limiting the catalytic process, although inducing higher affinity binding of the substrates.
   - The reversal of **ZmC4-NADP-ME|Zmme3** oxidation by chemical reductants suggests the presence of thiol groups able to form disulfide bonds. In order to identify the cysteine residues involved in the activity modulation, site-directed mutagenesis and MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight) analysis of **ZmC4-NADP-ME|Zmme3** were performed.
   - Overall, the results indicate that, besides having acquired a high level of expression and localization in BSCs, **ZmC4-NADP-ME|Zmme3** displays a particular redox modulation, which may be required to accomplish the C4 photosynthetic metabolism.
   - **ZmC4-NADP-ME|Zmme3** displays a particular redox modulation of its activity, which may be required to accomplish the C4 photosynthetic metabolism successfully.
