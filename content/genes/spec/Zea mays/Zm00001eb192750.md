## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb192750]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmSTK2|stk3</u>
- **Gene Name:** serine-threonine kinase3
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - ZmSTK1 and **ZmSTK2|stk3** are two receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCK) homologs in Zea mays as members of receptor-like protein kinase (RLK) subfamily, sharing 86% identity at the amino acid level.
   - ZmSTK1 and **ZmSTK2|stk3**, expressed at late stages of pollen development, regulate maize pollen development with additive effect.
   - ZmSTK1 or **ZmSTK2|stk3** mutation exhibited severe pollen transmission deficiency, which thus influenced pollen fertility.
   - The detective ZmSTK1 or **ZmSTK2|stk3** was associated with decreased activity of enolases and also reduced downstream metabolite contents, which enolases are involved in glycolytic pathway, such as phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), pyruvate, ADP/ATP, starch, glucose, sucrose and fructose.
   - ZmSTK1 and **ZmSTK2|stk3**, encoding receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, are involved in maize pollen development with additive effect.
