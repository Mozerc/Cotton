## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb393830]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmES2</u>
- **Gene Name:** embryo sac2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - ZmES genes encode peptides with structural homology to defensins and are specifically expressed in the female gametophyte of maize.
   - In order to investigate ZmES mRNA gradients in the highly polarized and vacuolized cells of the maize embryo sac, a whole-mount in situ protocol with isolated single cells was developed: as for total RNA, ZmES transcripts are uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of egg cell, synergids and central cell.
   - ZmES genes encode small, cysteine-rich proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide, probably for translocation into the embryo sac cell wall.
   - The four ZmES proteins display high sequence identity with each other, and the proposed tertiary structure of the mature peptides is similar to that of plant and animal defensins. The function of ZmES1â€“4 during the fertilization process is discussed.
