## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmFDR4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Fe deficiency-related 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Zea mays Fe deficiency-related 4 (**ZmFDR4**) functions as an iron transporter in the plastids of monocots.
   - The functional characterization of Zea mays Fe deficiency-related 4 (**ZmFDR4**), which was isolated from a differentially expressed clone of a cDNA library of Fe deficiency-induced maize roots.
   - **ZmFDR4** is homologous to the bacterial FliP superfamily, coexisted in both algae and terrestrial plants, and capable of restoring the normal growth of the yeast mutant fet3fet4, which possesses defective Fe uptake systems.
   - Bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPDS) colorimetry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicate that **ZmFDR4** is related to Fe uptake by plastids and increases seed Fe content. Finally, 35S:c-Myc-**ZmFDR4** transgenic tobacco show enhanced photosynthetic efficiency.
   - The results of the present study demonstrate that **ZmFDR4** functions as an iron transporter in monocot plastids and provide insight into the process of Fe uptake by plastids.
