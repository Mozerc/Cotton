## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb012250]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmLAC1</u>
- **Gene Name:** laccase11
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of a putative laccase gene, **ZmLAC1**, in maize primary roots under stress.
   - **ZmLAC1** was expressed in leaves, stems and roots of maize seedlings. In unstressed maize primary roots, a higher **ZmLAC1** transcript level was located in the basal region where cell elongation had ceased compared to the apical 5 mm of the roots where cells were rapidly dividing and elongating. 
   - Associated with the morphological change, the transcript level of **ZmLAC1** was enhanced in the apical 5 mm, reaching a level similar to that in the basal region. 
   - **ZmLAC1** transcript level could primarily help maintain cell wall integrity – and thus cell wall strength – during the acclimation to NaCl stress.
