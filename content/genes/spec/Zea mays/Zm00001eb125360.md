## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb125360]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmXYL|axs1</u>
- **Gene Name:** alpha-xylosidase1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The mutated gene, **ZmXYL|axs1**, encodes an α-xylosidase which functions in releasing xylosyl residue from a β-1,4-linked glucan chain.
   - Total α-xylosidase activity in the two alleles is significantly decreased compared to wild-type plants. Loss-of-function mutants of **ZmXYL|axs1** resulted in a decreased xylose content, an increased XXXG content in xyloglucan (XyG), and a reduced auxin content.
   - Based on our study, a model is proposed that places XXXG, an oligosaccharide derived from XyG and the substrate of **ZmXYL|axs1**, as having a negative impact on auxin homeostasis resulting in the dwarf phenotypes of the xyl mutants.
