## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb295850]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmFLA7</u>
- **Gene Name:** FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEIN7
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Reduced expression of selected FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEIN genes associates with the abortion of kernels in field crops of Zea mays (maize) and of Arabidopsis seeds.
   - The expression of **ZmFLA7** responded to drought only at the tip of the ear. The abundance of arabinogalactan protein (AGP) glycan epitopes decreased with drought and pharmacological treatments that reduce AGP activity enhanced the abortion of fertilized ovaries.
   - Drought reduced the expression of **ZmFLA7** at the tip of the ear whereas ZmFLA8 showed no significant effects of drought.
