## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb091710]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmCPK11</u>
- **Gene Name:** calcium dependent protein kinase11
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In the present study, the role of the maize CDPK **ZmCPK11** in ABA-induced antioxidant defence and the relationship between **ZmCPK11** and ZmMPK5, a maize ABA-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), in ABA signalling were investigated.
   - **ZmCPK11** is involved in abscisic acid-induced antioxidant defence and functions upstream of ZmMPK5 in abscisic acid signalling in maize.
   - **ZmCPK11** was shown to be required for the up-regulation of the expression and the activity of ZmMPK5 in ABA signalling, but ZmMPK5 had very little effect on the ABA-induced up-regulation of the expression and the activity of **ZmCPK11**.
   - **ZmCPK11** is involved in ABA-induced antioxidant defence and functions upstream of ZmMPK5 in ABA signalling in maize.
