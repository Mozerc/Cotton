## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb397990]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmCOI2b|coi6</u>
- **Gene Name:** coronatine insensitive6
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - ZmCOI2a and **ZmCOI2b|coi6** redundantly regulate anther dehiscence and gametophytic male fertility in maize.
   - ZmCOI2a and **ZmCOI2b|coi6**, that redundantly regulate gametophytic male fertility. Both ZmCOI2a and **ZmCOI2b|coi6** are highly homologous and constitutively expressed in all tissues tested. Subcellular localization revealed that ZmCOI2a and **ZmCOI2b|coi6** were located in the nucleus.
   - The coi2a coi2b double mutant, generated by CRISPR/Cas9, had non-dehiscent anthers, delayed anther development and MS. In addition, coi2a coi2b male gametes could not be transmitted to the next generation because of severe defects in pollen germination.
