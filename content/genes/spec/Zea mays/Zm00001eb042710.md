## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb042710]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmPHOT2</u>
- **Gene Name:** blue-light receptor phototropin 2
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Blue-light regulation of ZmPHOT1 and **ZmPHOT2** gene expression and the possible involvement of Zmphot1 in phototropism in maize coleoptiles.
   - ZmPHOT1 and **ZmPHOT2** are expressed differentially in maize coleoptiles and leaves, with Zmphot1 possibly involved in first-positive phototropic curvature of red-light-adapted maize coleoptiles exposed to pulsed low-fluence blue light.
   - Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that ZmPHOT1 was abundantly expressed in etiolated coleoptiles, while lower expressions of both ZmPHOT1 and **ZmPHOT2** were observed in young leaves.
   - Database and sequence analyses indicated that the protein encoded by **ZmPHOT2** belongs to the plant phot2 clade. Zmphot1 and **ZmPHOT2** contain two highly conserved LOV domains and a serine/threonine protein kinase domain, indicating that they are active phototropin proteins in maize, similar to phot1 and phot2 proteins in Arabidopsis and various other plants.
