## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb163120]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmPHOT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** blue-light receptor phototropin 1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Blue-light regulation of **ZmPHOT1** and ZmPHOT2 gene expression and the possible involvement of **ZmPHOT1** in phototropism in maize coleoptiles.
   - **ZmPHOT1** and ZmPHOT2 are expressed differentially in maize coleoptiles and leaves, with **ZmPHOT1** possibly involved in first-positive phototropic curvature of red-light-adapted maize coleoptiles exposed to pulsed low-fluence blue light.
   - The **ZmPHOT1** protein was investigated by Western blot analysis with anti-Osphot1 antibodies. **ZmPHOT1** was detected in microsomal fractions, with higher levels in coleoptiles than in leaves. HBL caused rapid phosphorylation of the protein, whereas no phot1 phosphorylation was induced by LBL.
   - The involvement of **ZmPHOT1** in LBL-induced phototropic curvature of maize coleoptiles is discussed.
