## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb235570]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmBT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** brittle endosperm1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Dual Targeting to Mitochondria and Plastids of AtBT1 and **ZmBT1**, Two Members of the Mitochondrial Carrier Family.
   - The patterns of GFP fluorescence distribution observed in plants stably expressing GFP fusions of **ZmBT1** and AtBT1 N-terminal extensions were fully congruent with that of plants expressing a plastidial marker fused to GFP.
   - Electron microscopic immunocytochemical analyses of maize endosperms using anti-**ZmBT1** antibodies further confirmed that **ZmBT1** occurs in both plastids and mitochondria.
   - The overall data showed that (i) **ZmBT1** and AtBT1 are dually targeted to mitochondria and plastids| (ii) AtBT1 and **ZmBT1** N-terminal extensions comprise targeting sequences exclusively recognized by the plastidial compartment| and (iii) targeting sequences to mitochondria are localized within the mature part of the BT1 proteins.
