## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [GRMZM2G435818]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmVPP5</u>
- **Gene Name:** vacuole H+-PPase 5
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Maize **ZmVPP5** is a truncated Vacuole H+-PPase that confers hypersensitivity to salt stress.
   - The overexpression of **ZmVPP5** in yeast cells caused a hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transgenic maize lines with overexpressed **ZmVPP5** also exhibited the salt hypersensitivity phenotype.
   - Although **ZmVPP5** shares high sequence similarity with ZmVPP1, **ZmVPP5** lacks the complete structure of the conserved proton transport and the inorganic pyrophosphatase-related domain.
   - Overall, this study suggests that **ZmVPP5** might act as a VPP antagonist and participate in the cellular response to salt stress. Our study of **ZmVPP5** has expanded the understanding of the origin and functions of truncated forms of plant VPPs.
