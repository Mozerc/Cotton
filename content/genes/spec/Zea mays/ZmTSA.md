## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmTSA</u>
- **Gene Name:** tryptophan synthase alpha
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two TSA homologs, hitherto uncharacterized **ZmTSA** and **ZmTSA**like, were functionally analyzed. **ZmTSA** is localized in plastids, the major site of tryptophan biosynthesis in plants.
   - A 160 kD tryptophan synthase complex was partially purified from maize leaves and **ZmTSA** was identified as native α-subunit of this complex by mass spectrometry.
   - **ZmTSA** has tryptophan synthase α activity.
   - It was demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that maize forms a tryptophan synthase complex and **ZmTSA** functions as α-subunit in this complex.
