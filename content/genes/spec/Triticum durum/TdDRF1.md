## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TdDRF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** dehydration responsive factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum durum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - B genome specific polymorphism in the **TdDRF1** gene is in relationship with grain yield.
   - Polymorphisms of the Triticum durum dehydration responsive factor 1 (**TdDRF1**) gene that belongs to DREB2 transcription factor family were identified and specifically assigned to the A or B genome.
   - A significant association between a specific polymorphism in the B genome copy of the **TdDRF1** gene and the grain yield in drought conditions were observed.
   - The **TdDRF1** gene expression was investigated in four genotypes of durum wheat and results suggested a genotype-dependent expression pattern in response to moderate water deficit in a time course experiment in controlled greenhouse conditions.
