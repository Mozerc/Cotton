## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TdPR61</u>
- **Gene Name:** Triticum durum cultivar Langdon PR61
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum durum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of the wheat gene encoding a grain-specific lipid transfer protein **TdPR61**, and promoter activity in wheat, barley and rice.
   - The full-length gene, including the promoter sequence of a TaPR61 orthologue, was cloned from a BAC library of Triticum durum. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of TaPR61 and **TdPR61** mainly in grain.
   - A transcriptional **TdPR61** promoterâ€“GUS fusion was stably transformed into wheat, barley, and rice. The strongest GUS expression in all three plants was found in the endosperm transfer cells, the embryo surrounding region (ESR), and in the embryo. The promoter is strong and has similar but not identical spatial patterns of activity in wheat, barley, and rice.
   - These results suggest that the **TdPR61** promoter will be a useful tool for improving grain quality by manipulating the quality and quantity of nutrient/lipid uptake to the endosperm and embryo.
