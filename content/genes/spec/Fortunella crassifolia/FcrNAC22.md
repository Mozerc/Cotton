## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FcrNAC22</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fortunella crassifolia*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Red light-induced kumquat fruit coloration is attributable to increased carotenoid metabolism regulated by **FcrNAC22**.
   - **FcrNAC22** localizes to the nucleus, and its gene expression is up-regulated as fruits change color. Results from dual luciferase, yeast one-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that **FcrNAC22** directly binds to, and activates the promoters of three genes encoding key enzymes in the carotenoid metabolic pathway.
   - **FcrNAC22** overexpression in citrus and tomato fruits as well as in citrus callus enhances expression of most carotenoid biosynthetic genes, accelerates plastid conversion into chromoplasts, and promotes color change.
   - Taken together, our results demonstrate that **FcrNAC22** is an important transcription factor that mediates red light-induced fruit coloration via up-regulation of carotenoid metabolism.
