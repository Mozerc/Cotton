## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD04G0113100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdLAC7</u>
- **Gene Name:** laccase 7
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The detailed analysis identified **MdLAC7**'s (laccase 7) role in the preharvest apple peel browning process.
   - Transient injection, overexpression, and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the **MdLAC7** gene in apple fruit and calli identified vallinic acid, anthocyanidin, tannic acid, sinapic acid, and catechinic acid as its catalytic substrates. In addition, yeast one-hybrid assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, luciferase reporter assay, and ChIP-PCR analysis revealed that MdWRKY31 binds to the promoter of **MdLAC7** and positively regulates its activity to promote peel browning of bagged fruits (dark conditions).
   - The expression of **MdLAC7** in the BF stalk cavity was detected initially at 165 DAFB, which then increased with the intensification of browning.
   - The study revealed the **MdLAC7**-mediated mechanism regulating preharvest apple peel browning and demonstrated the role of light in inhibiting **MdLAC7** activity and subsequently reducing peel browning. These results provide theoretical guidance for producing high-quality apple fruits.
