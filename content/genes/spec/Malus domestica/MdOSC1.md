## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdOSC1</u>
- **Gene Name:** oxidosqualene cyclase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The gene expression of **MdOSC1** was linked to the concentrations of ursolic and oleanolic acid, whereas the expression of MdOSC5 was correlated with the concentrations of betulinic acid and its caffeate derivatives.
   - The gene expression of four OSC genes (**MdOSC1**, MdOSC3, and MdOSC4 and MdOSC5) as well as the cytochrome P450 was also measured in a collection of 20 contrasting apple cultivars (in terms of triterpene accumulation) and revealed the key roles played by **MdOSC1** and MdOSC5 in explaining the concentrations of Î±-amyrin and lupeol derivatives, respectively.
   - Positive and significant correlations were found between the expression of **MdOSC1** and the contents of UA and OA, as well as between MdOSC5 expression and BA and triterpene-caffeate concentrations.
   - This study also suggests that **MdOSC1** and MdOSC5 are key genes in apple fruit triterpene biosynthesis.
