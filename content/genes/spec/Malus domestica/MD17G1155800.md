## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD17G1155800]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMa11</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Allelic variation of MdMYB123 controls malic acid content by regulating MdMa1 and **MdMa11** expression in apple.
   - Finding provides valuable functional validation of MdMYB123 and its role in the transcriptional regulation of both MdMa1 and **MdMa11**, and apple fruit malic acid accumulation.
   - Both proteins could bind to the promoters of MdMa1 and **MdMa11**, but only MdMYB123 could activate their transcription, suggesting their different roles in the regulation of apple fruit acidity.
   - **MdMa11** and MdMa13 genes encoding P3A-type and P3B-type proton pumps, respectively, are located on the tonoplast. Both P3A-type and P3B-type proton pumps can directly or indirectly mediate the transmembrane transport of H+ and affect vacuolar acidity.
