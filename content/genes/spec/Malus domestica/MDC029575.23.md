## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDC029575.23]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Md-NBS</u>
- **Gene Name:** NBS–LRR Protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Analysis of the expression of Md-miRLn11 and **Md-NBS** during the optimum invasion period in 40 apple varieties showed that the expression of **Md-NBS** gene in resistant varieties is higher than in susceptible varieties, with an inverse pattern for Md-miRLn11.
   - The result showed a clear decline of disease resistance in JiGuan apples. In contrast, the susceptible variety ‘FuJi’ infiltrated with the **Md-NBS** gene showed a significant increase in disease resistance.
   - Based on the above results, we propose that Md-miRLn11 regulates **Md-NBS** gene expression in particular under the condition of pathogen infection, and that the Md-miRLn11 targeting P-loop site may regulate many NBS–LRR protein class genes in woody plants.
   - The novel miRNA, Md-miRLn11, was shown to suppress the expression of the **Md-NBS** gene and decrease resistance to apple Alternaria leaf spot.
