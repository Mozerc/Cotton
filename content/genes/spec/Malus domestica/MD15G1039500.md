## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD15G1039500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdWRKY40</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Involvement of **MdWRKY40** in the defense of mycorrhizal apple against fusarium solani.
   - The overexpressed transcription factor **MdWRKY40** significantly improved the resistance of the apple ‘Orin’ callus to F. solani and the expression of the resistance gene MdGLU by binding the promoter of MdGLU.
   - In addition, **MdWRKY40** played an important role in the resistance of mycorrhizal apple seedlings to infection with F. solani.
   - The levels of expression of MdGLU in OE-**MdWRKY40** were significantly higher than the levels in wild type (WT) in all the resistance genes tested (P < 0.01). This suggests that **MdWRKY40** could improve the resistance of callus to F. solani by regulating the expression of MdGLU.
