## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000118899]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdCAIP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** C2-domain ABA Insensitive Protein1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - An Apple Protein Kinase MdSnRK1.1 Interacts with **MdCAIP1** to Regulate ABA Sensitivity.
   - Expression of the **MdCAIP1** gene was positively induced by ABA. Its overexpression enhanced ABA sensitivity in transgenic apple calli. 
   - Its overexpression enhanced ABA sensitivity in transgenic apple calli. Furthermore, it was found that MdSnRK1.1 phosphorylated the **MdCAIP1** protein in vivo and promoted its degradation in vitro and in vivo.
   - The functions of **MdCAIP1** in the ABA response were characterized with expression and transgenic analyses. Finally, it was further investigated and discussed that MdSnRK1.1 interacts with and decreases the stability of **MdCAIP1** to control the ABA response synergistically.
