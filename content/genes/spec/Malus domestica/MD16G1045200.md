## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD16G1045200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMa1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Allelic variation of MdMYB123 controls malic acid content by regulating **MdMa1** and **MdMa1**1 expression in apple.
   - Finding provides valuable functional validation of MdMYB123 and its role in the transcriptional regulation of both **MdMa1** and **MdMa1**1, and apple fruit malic acid accumulation.
   - Both proteins could bind to the promoters of **MdMa1** and **MdMa1**1, but only MdMYB123 could activate their transcription, suggesting their different roles in the regulation of apple fruit acidity.
   - A candidate Ma locus gene, **MdMa1**, was identified and shown to increase malate influx into the vacuole, accounting for âˆ¼7.46% of the observed phenotypic variation in the malic acid content of mature fruits
