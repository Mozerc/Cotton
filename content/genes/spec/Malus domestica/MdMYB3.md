## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMYB3</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB domain class transcription factor3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - An apple MYB transcription factor, **MdMYB3**, is involved in regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and flower development.
   - When this gene is ectopically expressed in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petite Havana SR1, flowers of transgenic tobacco lines carrying **MdMYB3** have exhibited increased pigmentation and accumulate higher levels of anthocyanins and flavonols than wild-type flowers. 
   - Overexpression of **MdMYB3** has resulted in transcriptional activation of several flavonoid pathway genes, including CHS, CHI, UFGT, and FLS. Moreover, peduncles of flowers and styles of pistils of transgenic plants overexpressing **MdMYB3** are longer than those of wild-type plants, thus suggesting that this TF is involved in regulation of flower development.
   - This TF, designated as **MdMYB3**, is involved in transcriptional activation of several flavonoid pathway genes. Moreover, this TF not only regulates the accumulation of anthocyanin in the skin of apple fruits, but it is also involved in the regulation of flower development, particularly that of pistil development.
