## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD06G1029400]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdNRT1.5|MdNPF7.3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The MdABI5 transcription factor interacts with the **MdNRT1.5|MdNPF7.3**/**MdNRT1.5|MdNPF7.3** promoter to fine-tune nitrate transport from roots to shoots in apple.
   - The transcription of the nitrate transporter **MdNRT1.5|MdNPF7.3**/**MdNRT1.5|MdNPF7.3** was noticeably reduced at the transcriptional level by ABA, which inhibited the transport of nitrate from roots to shoots.
   - It was found that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdABI5 bound directly to the ABRE recognition site of the **MdNRT1.5|MdNPF7.3** promoter and suppressed its expression.
   - Overall, these results demonstrate that MdABI5 regulates the transport of nitrate from roots to shoots partially by mediating the expression of **MdNRT1.5|MdNPF7.3**, illuminating the molecular mechanism by which ABA regulates nitrate transport in apple.
