## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdSPDS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** spermidine synthase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ectopic expression of **MdSPDS1** in sweet orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck) reduces canker susceptibility: involvement of H2O2 production and transcriptional alteration.
   - As for TG9, despite a substantial increase of the **MdSPDS1** mRNA, endogenous Spd and Spm levels were just slightly increased, which demonstrated that no direct correlation exists between the transcription level of a biosynthetic gene and the product of the protein activity.
   - Taken together, overexpression of **MdSPDS1** increased the endogenous cellular Spm, which may serve as a signal to directly trigger expression of the defense-related genes under normal conditions.
   - Our results demonstrated that overexpression of the **MdSPDS1** gene prominently lowered the sensitivity of the transgenic plants to canker.
