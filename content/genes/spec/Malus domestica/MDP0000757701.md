## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000757701]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdJAZ18</u>
- **Gene Name:** jasmonate ZIM-domain protein 18
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - MdSnRK1.1 interacts with **MdJAZ18** to regulate sucrose-induced anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin accumulation in apple.
   - MdSnRK1.1 then phosphorylated **MdJAZ18** to facilitate its 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, which released MdbHLH3 thereby activating the expression of the regulatory and structural genes, thus finally promoting the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and PAs.
   - **MdJAZ18** is involved in MdSnRK1.1-induced anthocyanin and PA accumulation.
   - These findings suggested that **MdJAZ18** was involved in MdSnRK1.1-induced anthocyanin and PA accumulation by modulating the expression of the regulatory and structural genes.
