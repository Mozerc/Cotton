## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa1G574870]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsNADP-ME2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Cucumber Chinese Long Genome v2(http://cucurbitgenomics.org/organism/2)]()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cucumber malate decarboxylase, **CsNADP-ME2**, functions in the balance of carbon and amino acid metabolism in fruit.
   - Histochemical localization revealed that **CsNADP-ME2** was mainly located in the exocarp and vascular bundle system of fruit.
   - Radiotracer and gas-exchange analysis indicated that overexpression of **CsNADP-ME2** could promote carbon flux into soluble sugars and starch in fruits.
   - Further studies combined with metabolic profiling revealed that the downregulation of **CsNADP-ME2** in RNA interference (RNAi) lines caused the accumulation of its substrate, malate, in the exocarp.
   - The opposite effect was found in **CsNADP-ME2**-overexpressing lines, suggesting that there may be a continuous bottom-up feedback regulation of glycolysis in cucumber fruits.
   - Overall, our studies indicate that **CsNADP-ME2** may play potential roles in both central carbon reactions and amino acid metabolism in cucumber fruits.
