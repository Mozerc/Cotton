## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000151000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdBT2</u>
- **Gene Name:** bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad protein 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Dynamic regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis at different light intensities by the BT2-TCP46-MYB1 module in apple.
   - MdTCP46 also interacted with a bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad (BTB) protein, **MdBT2**, that is responsive to high light intensity, which ubiquitinated MdTCP46 and mediated its degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway.
   - The expression of **MdBT2** was suppressed by high light intensity at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. **MdBT2** suppressed the role of MdTCP46 by inducing its ubiquitination, resulting in subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway.
   - Our results demonstrate that the dynamic regulatory module **MdBT2**-MdTCP46-MdMYB1 plays a key role in modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis at different light intensities in apple, and provides new insights into the post-transcriptional regulation of TCP proteins.
