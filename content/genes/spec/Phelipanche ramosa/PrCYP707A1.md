## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PrCYP707A1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ABA 8'-hydroxylase CYP707A1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Phelipanche ramosa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PrCYP707A1**, an ABA catabolic gene, is a key component of Phelipanche ramosa seed germination in response to the strigolactone analogue GR24.
   - Two up-regulated sequences corresponded to an abscisic acid (ABA) catabolic gene, **PrCYP707A1**, encoding an ABA 8'-hydroxylase. Using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method, two full-length cDNAs, **PrCYP707A1** and PrCYP707A2, were isolated from seeds. Both genes were always expressed at low levels during conditioning during which an initial decline in ABA levels was recorded.
   - GR24 application after conditioning triggered a strong up-regulation of **PrCYP707A1** during the first 18h, followed by an 8-fold decrease in ABA levels detectable 3 d after treatment.
   - In situ hybridization experiments on GR24-treated seeds revealed a specific **PrCYP707A1** mRNA accumulation in the cells located between the embryo and the micropyle. Abz-E2B, a specific inhibitor of CYP707A enzymes, significantly impeded seed germination, proving to be a non-competitive antagonist of GR24 with reversible inhibitory activity.
   - These results demonstrate that P. ramosa seed dormancy release relies on ABA catabolism mediated by the GR24-dependent activation of **PrCYP707A1**. In addition, in situ hybridization corroborates the putative location of cells receptive to the germination
