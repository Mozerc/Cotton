## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TCONS_00012718]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PpTFL1-1a</u>
- **Gene Name:** TERMINAL FLOWER1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus pyrifolia*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The induction of the productive meristem identity MADS-box gene AP1 after repression of PpTFL1s suggested a primary role for PpTFL1 in floral induction.
   - RNA-seq analysis suggested that plant hormone-related genes and several transcription factors that were coexpressed with PpTFL1 were potentially involved in the PpTFL1-mediated floral induction.
   - Functional annotation of the genes coexpressed with PpTFL1 revealed the involvement of many plant hormone-related genes.
   - Our data indicate the essential function of TFL1 in pear floral induction and add another species in the family Rosaceae in addition to strawberry and rose that shows a role for TFL1 in floral induction.
