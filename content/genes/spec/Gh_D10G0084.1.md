## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_D10G0084.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhIMP10D</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [CottonFGD (https://cottonfgd.org/)]()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhIMP10D**, an inositol monophosphates family gene, enhances ascorbic acid and antioxidant enzyme activities to confer alkaline tolerance in Gossypium hirsutum.
   - In particular, some IMP genes may be involved in alkaline stress tolerance regulation, and **GhIMP10D** showed high expression levels in leaves, stems and roots under alkaline stress, and preliminary functional verification of **GhIMP10D** gene suggested that it may regulate tolerance to alkaline stress by regulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the content of AsA.
   - A highly expressed gene **GhIMP10D** induced by alkaline stress was selected, and the gene was silenced using VIGS technology to study its function. The objective of this study was to explore the evolutionary relationship of the IMP gene family and its potential function in alkaline tolerance.
