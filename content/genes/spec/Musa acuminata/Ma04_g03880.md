## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Ma04_g03880]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MaMPK14</u>
- **Gene Name:** Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Musa acuminata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MaMPK14** cooperated with MaMYB4 to mediate postharvest banana fruit ripening.
   - Transient overexpression of individual **MaMPK14** and MaMYB4 in banana fruit delayed fruit ripening, confirming the negative roles in the ripening.
   - Importantly, phosphorylation of MaMYB4 by **MaMPK14** enhanced the MaMYB4-mediated transcriptional inhibition, binding strength, protein stability, and the repression of fruit ripening.
   - Delineated the regulation pathway of MAPK module during banana fruit ripening, which involved the phosphorylation modification of MaMYB4 mediated by **MaMPK14**.
