- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Musa acuminata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MaMADS1**–MaNAC083 transcriptional regulatory cascade regulates ethylene biosynthesis during banana fruit ripening.
   - **MaMADS1**, a ripening-induced MADS (MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, SRF4) transcription factor, was found to directly repress the expression of MaNAC083, inhibiting trans-repression of MaNAC083 to ethylene biosynthesis genes, thereby attenuating MaNAC083-repressed ethylene production in bananas.
   - These findings collectively illustrated the mechanistic basis of a **MaMADS1**–MaNAC083–MaACS1/MaACOs regulatory cascade controlling ethylene biosynthesis during banana fruit ripening.
   - **MaMADS1** promotes ethylene biosynthesis through transcriptional repression of MaNAC083.
