## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MaERF11</u>
- **Gene Name:** ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR11
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Musa acuminata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Banana Transcription Factor **MaERF11** Recruits Histone Deacetylase MaHDA1 and Represses the Expression of MaACO1 and Expansins during Fruit Ripening.
   - **MaERF11** has intrinsic transcriptional repression activity in planta.
   - **MaERF11** physically interacts with a histone deacetylase, MaHDA1, which has histone deacetylase activity, and the interaction significantly strengthens the **MaERF11**-mediated transcriptional repression of MaACO1 and Expansins.
   - Taken together, these findings suggest that **MaERF11** may recruit MaHDA1 to its target genes and repress their expression via histone deacetylation.
