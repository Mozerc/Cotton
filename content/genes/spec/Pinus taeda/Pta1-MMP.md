## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Pta1-MMP</u>
- **Gene Name:** matrix metalloproteinase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pinus taeda*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Pta1-MMP** protein has the structural characteristics of other plant MMPs, the recombinant protein exhibits Zn2+-dependent protease activity, and is inhibited by EDTA and the active site-binding hydroxamate inhibitor GM6001.
   - The **Pta1-MMP** gene is expressed in both embryo and megagametophyte, with transcript levels increasing in both during the period from proembryo to early cotyledonary stage, then declining during late embryogenesis and maturation drying. 
   - **Pta1-MMP** gene transcript levels increased in association with radicle protrusion for both GA3- and water-treated embryos, in agreement with MMP-like activity.
   - Our results suggest that MMP activity may be involved in ECM modification, facilitating the cell division and expansion required during seed development, germination completion, and subsequent seedling establishment.
