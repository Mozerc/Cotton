## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>OfCCD1</u>
- **Gene Name:** carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Osmanthus fragrans*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A cDNA encoding a carotenoid cleavage enzyme, **OfCCD1**, was identified from transcripts isolated from flowers of O. fragrans Lour.
   - It was also found that carotenoid content, volatile emissions, and **OfCCD1** transcript levels are subjected to photorhythmic changes and principally increased during daylight hours. At the times when **OfCCD1** transcript levels reached their maxima, the carotenoid content remained low or slightly decreased.
   - **OfCCD1** transcript levels displayed steady-state oscillations, suggesting that the substrate availability in the cellular compartments is changing or other regulatory factors are involved in volatile norisoprenoid formation.
   - **OfCCD1** isolated from liquid cultures containing ferrous iron yielded active recombinant **OfCCD1** enzymes that degraded Î²-carotene faster and without the supplement of additional ferrous iron.
