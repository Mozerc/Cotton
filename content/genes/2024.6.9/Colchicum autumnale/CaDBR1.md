## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaDBR1</u>
- **Gene Name:** double-bond reductase enzyme 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Colchicum autumnale*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional characterization of a Colchicum autumnale L. double-bond reductase (**CaDBR1**) in colchicine biosynthesis.
   - Recombinant **CaDBR1** protein was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by a Ni-NTA column. In vitro enzyme assays indicated that **CaDBR1** could catalyse 4-coumaraldehyde to form 4-HDCA but could not generate 4-HDCA by taking cinnamaldehyde as a substrate. 
   - An alkenal double-bond reductase enzyme (**CaDBR1**) was cloned from Colchicum autumnale L. The encoded enzyme catalysed 4-coumaraldehyde to 4-hydroxydihydrocinnamaldehyde (4-HDCA). Its functional characterization increased the understanding of colchicine biosynthesis.
   - Stable transformation into tobacco BY-2 cells revealed that **CaDBR1** localized in the cytoplasm, and tissue-specific expression results showed that **CaDBR1** had the highest expression in bulbs.
