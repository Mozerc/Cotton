## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PpCBF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** C-repeat binding factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Prunus persica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The overexpression of a peach CBF (**PpCBF1**) gene in a transgenic line of own-rooted apple (Malus×domestica) M.26 rootstock (T166) trees was previously reported to have additional effects on the onset of dormancy and time of spring budbreak.
   - No **PpCBF1** transcript was detected in the phloem or cambium of RG scions grafted on T166 rootstocks indicating that no graft transmission of transgene mRNA had occurred. 
   - Constitutive overexpression of the **PpCBF1** in apple resulted in a 4–6°C increase in freezing tolerance in both the non-acclimated and acclimated states, respectively, compared with untransformed M.26 trees.
   - In contrast to own-rooted T166 trees, no impact of **PpCBF1** overexpression in T166 rootstocks was observed on the onset of dormancy, budbreak or non-acclimated leaf-cold hardiness in RG/T166 trees.
   - Overexpressing **PpCBF1** exhibited all the characteristics observed in growth chamber studies, including enhanced cold hardiness in acclimated and non-acclimated leaves, growth inhibition, early dormancy and premature leaf senescence.
