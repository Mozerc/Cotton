## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Prupe.7G118000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PpDML1</u>
- **Gene Name:** DNA demethylase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Prunus persica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcription factor PpNAC1 and DNA demethylase **PpDML1** synergistically regulate peach fruit ripening.
   - Declining DNA methylation was negatively associated with increased transcripts of DNA demethylase1 (**PpDML1**), whose promoter is recognized and activated by PpNAC1.
   - **PpDML1** is the DNA demethylase member with the highest transcript abundance in fruit, and its concentration showed a substantial negative association with the level of DNA methylation both during ripening and under cold storage.
   - it was revealed that PpNAC1 also activates the expression of **PpDML1** and this promotes the decrease in DNA methylation level of ripening-related genes, increases their transcription, and decreases the DNA methylation level of PpNAC1.
