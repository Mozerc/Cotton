## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [ppa008176m]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PpYUC11</u>
- **Gene Name:** YUCCA flavin mono-oxygenase11
- **Genome:** [Prunus persica v1.0 assembly at the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR, http://www.rosaceae.org/)]()
- **Species:** *Prunus persica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PpYUC11**, a strong candidate gene for the stony hard phenotype in peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch), participates in IAA biosynthesis during fruit ripening.
   - It is revealed here that a YUCCA flavin mono-oxygenase gene (**PpYUC11**, ppa008176m), a key gene in auxin biosynthesis, displayed an identical differential expression profile to the profiles of IAA accumulation and PpACS1 transcription: the mRNA transcripts increased at the late ripening stage in melting flesh peaches but were below the limit of detection in mature fruits of stony hard peaches.
   - The strong association between intron TC microsatellite genotypes of **PpYUC11** and the flesh texture (normal or stony hard) is described in 43 peach varieties, indicating that this locus may be responsible for the stony hard phenotype in peach.
   - These findings support the hypothesis that **PpYUC11** may play an essential role in auxin biosynthesis during peach fruit ripening and is a candidate gene for the control of the stony hard phenotype in peach.
