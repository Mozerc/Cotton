## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [ppa006857m]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PpPG22</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Prunus persica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The downregulation of PpPG21 and **PpPG22** expression in melting-flesh peach delays fruit softening and hinders texture changes by influencing pectin solubilization and depolymerization.
   - Suppressing the expression of PpPG21 and **PpPG22** by VIGS in MF peaches significantly reduced PG enzyme activity, maintained the firmness of the fruit during the late shelf life stage, and suppressed the occurrence of the “melting” stage compared with the control fruits. 
   - Changes in the expression levels of pectin depolymerization-related genes after the downregulation of PpPG21 and 22 expression in MF fruit.
   - These results indicate that PpPG21 and 22 play a major role in the development of the melting texture trait of peaches by depolymerizing cell wall pectin. Our results provide direct evidence showing that PG regulates peach fruit softening and texture changes.
