## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Prupe.6G323700]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PpSnRK1βγ</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose non-fermenting 1 related kinase
- **Genome:** [reference peach genome (release version 2.0_a2.1)(https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-017-3606-9)]()
- **Species:** *Prunus persica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Reduced expression of a subunit gene of sucrose non-fermenting 1 related kinase, **PpSnRK1βγ**, confers flat fruit abortion in peach by regulating sugar and starch metabolism.
   - By combining association and gene expression analysis, a key candidate gene, **PpSnRK1βγ**, was identified. A 1.67-Mb inversion co-segregated with flat fruit shape altered the promoter activity of **PpSnRK1βγ**, resulting in much lower expression in aborting flat peach.
   - Ectopic transformation in tomato and transient overexpression in peach fruit have shown that **PpSnRK1βγ** could increase sugar and starch contents.
   - Comparative transcriptome analysis further confirmed that **PpSnRK1βγ** participated in carbohydrate metabolism. Subcellular localization found that **PpSnRK1βγ** was located in nucleus.
