## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.18G278100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmCOL1b</u>
- **Gene Name:** CONSTANS-like 1b
- **Genome:** [Wm82.a4.v1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - GmCOL1a and **GmCOL1b** Function as Flowering Repressors in Soybean Under Long-Day Conditions.
   - Here, we analyze the expression patterns of E1, E2 and GmCOL1a/1b using near-isogenic lines (NILs), and we further analyze flowering-related genes in **GmCOL1b** mutants and GmCOL1a-overexpressing plants.
   - The spatial and temporal patterns of GmCOL1a/1b expression were more similar to those of AtCOL2 than to those of AtCO, **GmCOL1b** mutants flowered earlier than wild-type plants under long-day (LD) conditions, and the overexpression of GmCOL1a caused late flowering under LD or natural conditions.
   - We conclude that these genes may function as part of a negative feedback loop, and GmCOL1a/**GmCOL1b** genes may serve as suppressors in photoperiodic flowering in soybean under LD conditions.
