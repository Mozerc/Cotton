## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.09G113800]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmSPL9b</u>
- **Gene Name:** SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE9
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis of GmSPL9 genes alters plant architecture in soybean.
   - These four GmSPL9 genes are negatively regulated by GmmiR156b, a target for the improvement of soybean plant architecture and yields.
   - A 1-bp deletion was detected in one target site of the GmSPL9a and one target site of the **GmSPL9b**, respectively, by DNA sequencing analysis of two T0-generation plants.
   - In addition, the expression levels of the examined GmSPL9 genes were higher in the spl9b-1 single mutant than wild-type plants, which might suggest a feedback regulation on the expression of the investigated GmSPL9 genes in soybean.
   - The findings demonstrated that GmSPL9a, **GmSPL9b**, GmSPL9c and GmSPL9 function as redundant transcription factors in regulating plant architecture in soybean.
