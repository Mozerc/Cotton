## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.18G02270]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>WI12Rhg1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **WI12Rhg1** interacts with DELLAs and mediates soybean cyst nematode resistance through hormone pathways.
   - Knockout of **WI12Rhg1** reduces the expression of DELLA18, and the expression of **WI12Rhg1** is itself induced by either JA, SA or GA.
   - The content of the defence hormone SA is significantly lower whilst GA12 and GA53 are increased in **WI12Rhg1** knockout roots compared with unedited hairy roots. We find that **WI12Rhg1** directly interacts with DELLA18 (Glyma.18G040000) in yeast and plants and that double knockout of DELLA18 and its homeolog DELLA11 (Glyma.11G216500) significantly reduces SCN resistance and alters the root morphology.
   - Our findings highlight the critical roles of **WI12Rhg1** and DELLA proteins in SCN resistance through interconnection with hormone signalling.
