## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.08G076300]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmVTL1b</u>
- **Gene Name:** vacuolar iron transporter like 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - GmVTL1a and **GmVTL1b** are specifically expressed in the fixation zone of soybean nodules.
   - GmVTL1 knockout minimally affected soybean growth under nonsymbiotic conditions, but dramatically impaired nodule development and SNF activity under nitrogen-limited and rhizobia-inoculation conditions, which eventually led to growth retardation.
   - Though both GmVTL1a/b genes were specifically expressed in the fixation zone of the nodule, GmVTL1a was the lone member to be localized at the tonoplast of tobacco protoplasts, and shown to facilitate ferrous iron transport in yeast.
   - GmVTL1 knockout resulted in curtailed nodule development under N-limited conditions, which was accompanied by decreased nitrogenase activity and reduced Fe content in the symbiosome.
