## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmPM28</u>
- **Gene Name:** maturation protein PM28
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - GmPM1 or **GmPM28** proteins showed a conformational change under hydrophobic or dry conditions. After fast or slow drying, the two proteins showed slightly increased proportions of defined secondary structures (α-helix and β-sheet), from 30 to 49% and from 34 to 42% for GmPM1 and **GmPM28**, respectively.
   - In the dehydrated state, GmPM1 and **GmPM28** interact with non-reducing sugars to improve the transition temperature of cellular glass, with poly-L-lysine to prevent dehydration-induced aggregation and with phospholipids to maintain the liquid crystal phase over a wide temperature range.

   - GmPM1 and **GmPM28** contain small amounts of left-handed extended helical structures, termed poly(L-Pro)-type II (PPII)-like structures, at low temperatures.
