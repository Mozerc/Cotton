## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.07g223000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmVamp721a</u>
- **Gene Name:** vesicle-associated membrane protein 721a
- **Genome:** [Wm82.a2.v1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - VAMP721a and VAMP721d are important for pectin dynamics and release of bacteria in soybean nodules.
   - GmVAMP721d and its closest paralogue **GmVamp721a** are expressed in roots and nodules, whereas the level of GmVAMP721d expression is four times higher in nodules relative to roots.
   - The results therefore show that silencing of VAMP721d and VAMP721a blocks normal bacterial release and symbiosome formation in soybean nodules, demonstrating that the VAMP72d/a exocytotic pathway is operational and required for bacterial release in this symbiosis, as previously observed in M. truncatula.
   - VAMP721a, was recently shown to be a target of regulator of symbiosome differentiation (RSD).
