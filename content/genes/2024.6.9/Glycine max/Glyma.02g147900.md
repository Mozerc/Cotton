## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.02g147900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmALMT5</u>
- **Gene Name:** aluminum-activated malate transporter 5
- **Genome:** [Wm82.a2.v1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - One root-specific GmALMT whose expression was significantly enhanced by Pi-starvation, **GmALMT5**, was studied in more detail to determine its possible role in soybean P nutrition.
   - Analysis of **GmALMT5** tissue expression patterns, subcellular localization, and malate exudation from transgenic soybean hairy roots overexpressing **GmALMT5**, demonstrated that **GmALMT5** is a plasma membrane protein that mediates malate efflux from roots.
   - Furthermore, both growth and P content of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing **GmALMT5** were significantly increased when sparingly soluble Ca-P was used as the external P source.
   - One member of this family, **GmALMT5**, might contribute to soybean P efficiency by enhancing utilization of sparingly soluble P sources under P limited conditions.
