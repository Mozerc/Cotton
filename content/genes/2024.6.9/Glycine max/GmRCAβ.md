## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmRCAβ</u>
- **Gene Name:** Rubisco activase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmRCAβ** was expressed at higher mRNA and protein levels. In addition, GmRCAα and **GmRCAβ** were positively correlated with chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and seed yield, suggesting that changes in expression of RCA has a potential applicability in breeding for enhanced soybean productivity.
   - Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the **GmRCAβ** promoter were identified and shown to correlate with expression level diversity.
   - As promoters can affect both cis- and trans-acting eQTLs by altering cis-acting regulatory elements or transcription factor binding sites, this work subsequently focused on the promoter region of **GmRCAβ**.
   - GmRCAα and **GmRCAβ** were positively correlated with chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and seed yield, suggesting that changes in expression of RCA has a potential applicability in breeding for enhanced soybean productivity.
