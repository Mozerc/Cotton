## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmFAD7-1</u>
- **Gene Name:** omega-3 fatty acid desaturase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Genomic sequencing analysis together with searches at the soybean genome database further confirmed that both GmFAD7 genes were located in two different loci within the soybean genome, suggesting that the soybean ω3 plastidial desaturase FAD7 is encoded by two different paralogous genes.
   - These GmFAD7 protein conformations were affected in vitro by changes in the redox conditions of thiol groups and iron availability.
   - The deduced amino acid sequences of **GmFAD7-1** and GmFAD7-2 presented a high degree of homology (77%) to the cold-inducible plastidial ω3 desaturase GmFAD8 protein.
   - These seed-specific GmFAD7 protein complexes may serve as a reserve pool to initiate FAD7 activity upon germination and plant differentiation, when leaf tissue is forming and membrane lipids are needed.
