## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmMIPS-1|GmMIPS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Localization of myo-inositol phosphate synthase (**GmMIPS-1|GmMIPS1**) during the early stages of soybean seed development.
   - Seed-specific expression of a soybean isoform (**GmMIPS-1|GmMIPS1**) has been demonstrated, but tissue-specific localization during embryo development has not been reported.
   - Using immunolocalization techniques, a specialized area of **GmMIPS-1|GmMIPS1** expression was identified in the outer integumentary layer during early soybean seed development.
   - In addition, localization data provided evidence that MIPS was associated with oxalate crystal idioblasts.
