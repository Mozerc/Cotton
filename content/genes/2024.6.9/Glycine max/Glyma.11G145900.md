## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.11G145900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmDrb2b</u>
- **Gene Name:** Double-stranded RNA-binding2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - An efficient CRISPR/Cas9 reagent was used to create a bi-allelic double mutant for the two soya bean paralogous Double-stranded RNA-binding2 (GmDrb2a and **GmDrb2b**) genes.
   - The mutated alleles in these two plants were identical (this was true for both gene targets, GmDrb2a and **GmDrb2b**), and at least one CRISPR/Cas9 transgene insertion was transmitted to all T1 progeny.
   - The generation of the Gmdrb2ab double mutant provides an excellent opportunity to characterize miRNA-directed responses to stress in soya bean and for the subsequent comparison of GmDRB2 function to the well-documented functionality of the AtDRB2 protein.
