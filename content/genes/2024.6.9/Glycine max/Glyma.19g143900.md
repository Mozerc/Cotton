## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.19g143900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmPTF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmPTF1** modifies root architecture responses to phosphate starvation primarily through regulating GmEXPB2 expression in soybean.
   - Demonstrated that **GmPTF1**, a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is the regulatory factor responsible for the induction of GmEXPB2 expression in response to Pi starvation.
   - Both **GmPTF1** and GmEXPB2 highly expressed in lateral roots, and were significantly enhanced by P deficiency.
   - This work identifies a novel regulatory factor, **GmPTF1**, involved in changing soybean root architecture partially through regulation of the expression of GmEXPB2 by binding the E-box motif in its promoter region.
