## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmUGT4</u>
- **Gene Name:** isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase UGT4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmUGT4** was expressed in the roots (mainly in lateral roots) of the 7-day-old seedlings and seeds, both of which contained abundant amounts of isoflavone conjugates.
   - The functional importance of **GmUGT4** in the biosynthesis of isoflavone conjugates in lateral roots has been discussed in conjunction with the proposed role of the stored precursors of isoflavones during rhizobia-mediated nodulation.
   - **GmUGT4** could be responsible for the 7-O-glucosylation of isoflavones in the isoflavonoid-rich organs and tissues of the soybean plant.
   - We proposed that the role of isoflavone glucosylation in a soybean plant is assigned to different GmUGT members in an organ/tissue-dependent manner. We also established the functional importance of **GmUGT4** in the biosynthesis of isoflavone conjugates in lateral roots that make a major contribution to overall N2 fixation.
