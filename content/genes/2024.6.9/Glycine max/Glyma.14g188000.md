## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.14g188000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmPT7</u>
- **Gene Name:** Phosphate Transporter7
- **Genome:** [Wm82.a2.v1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Soybean Mycorrhiza-Inducible Phosphate Transporter Gene, **GmPT7**, also Shows Localized Expression at the Tips of Vein Endings of Senescent Leaves.
   - **GmPT7** was originally identified as an arbuscular mycorrhiza-inducible gene of soybean that encodes a member of subfamily I in the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER 1 family.
   - The expression of **GmPT7** occurred only in the late stage of phosphorus translocation from leaves to seeds, after water evaporation from the leaves ceased, and later than the expression of GmUPS1-2, GmNRT1.7a and GmNRT1.7b, which are possibly involved in nitrogen export.
   - **GmPT7** was highly expressed in mature, but not in collapsed, arbuscule-containing cortical cells, suggesting its importance in the absorption of fungus-derived phosphate and/or arbuscule development.
