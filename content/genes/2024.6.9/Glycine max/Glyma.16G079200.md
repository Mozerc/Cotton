## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.16G079200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmBIR1</u>
- **Gene Name:** BAK1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR LIKE KINASE1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The soybean immune receptor **GmBIR1** regulates host transcriptome, spliceome, and immunity during cyst nematode infection.
   - Overexpression of wild-type variant of **GmBIR1** (WT-**GmBIR1**) using transgenic soybean hairy roots significantly increased soybean susceptibility to SCN, whereas overexpression of kinase-dead variant (KD-**GmBIR1**) significantly increased plant resistance.
   - Genome-wide analysis of splicing events provided compelling evidence supporting a role of the **GmBIR1** signaling pathway in establishing alternative splicing during SCN infection.
   - Our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the function of the **GmBIR1** signaling pathway in regulating soybean transcriptome and spliceome via differential phosphorylation of splicing factors and regulation of splicing events of pre-mRNA decay- and spliceosome-related genes.
