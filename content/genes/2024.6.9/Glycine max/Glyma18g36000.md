## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma18g36000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmRIN4c</u>
- **Gene Name:** RPM1-interacting 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmRIN4c** and GmRIN4d are not required for Rpg1-b-derived resistance.
   - Furthermore, even though **GmRIN4c** and d are not required for Rpg1-b-derived resistance, they do function in resistance derived from other R loci.
   - silencing **GmRIN4c** or d did not alter Rpg1-b resistance to Psg avrB| levels of Psg avrB were comparable in control, **GmRIN4c**- or d-silenced plants, while GmRIN4a or b silenced plants accumulated sevenfold more bacteria.
   - These results demonstrated that the lack of either **GmRIN4c** or d could affect basal defense to virulent pathogens in soybean.
