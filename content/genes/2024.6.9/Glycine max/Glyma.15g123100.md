## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.15g123100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmPHR25</u>
- **Gene Name:** PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 25
- **Genome:** [Wm82.a2.v1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmPHR25**, a GmPHR member up-regulated by phosphate starvation, controls phosphate homeostasis in soybean.
   - **GmPHR25**, which is up-regulated in response to Pi starvation, was then overexpressed in soybean hairy roots in vitro and in vivo to investigate its functions.
   - The results showed that overexpressing **GmPHR25** increased Pi concentration in transgenic soybean hairy roots under normal conditions, accompanied with a significant decrease in hairy root growth.
   - Taken together, this study suggests that **GmPHR25** is a vital regulator in the P signaling network, and controls Pi homeostasis in soybean.
