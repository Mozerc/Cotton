## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmDREB3</u>
- **Gene Name:** dehydration-responsive element binding protein 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cold-induced modulation and functional analyses of the DRE-binding transcription factor gene, **GmDREB3**, in soybean.
   - This response was similar to those of members in the A-1 subgroup and different from those of other members in the A-5 subgroup, suggesting that the **GmDREB3** gene was involved in an ABA-independent cold stress-responsive signal pathway.
   - Overexpression of **GmDREB3** enhanced tolerance to cold, drought, and high salt stresses in transgenic Arabidopsis.
   - **GmDREB3** transgenic tobacco accumulated higher levels of free proline under drought stress and retained higher leaf chlorophyll levels under high salt stress than wild-type tobacco.
   - Constitutive expression of **GmDREB3** in transgenic Arabidopsis caused growth retardation, whereas its expression under control of the stress-inducible Rd29A promoter minimized negative effects on plant growth under normal growth conditions, indicating that a combination of the Rd29A promoter and **GmDREB3** might be useful for improving tolerance to environmental stresses in crop plants.
