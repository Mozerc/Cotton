## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmPM1</u>
- **Gene Name:** maturation protein PM1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmPM1** or GmPM28 proteins showed a conformational change under hydrophobic or dry conditions. After fast or slow drying, the two proteins showed slightly increased proportions of defined secondary structures (α-helix and β-sheet), from 30 to 49% and from 34 to 42% for **GmPM1** and GmPm28, respectively.
   - In the dehydrated state, **GmPM1** and GmPM28 interact with non-reducing sugars to improve the transition temperature of cellular glass, with poly-L-lysine to prevent dehydration-induced aggregation and with phospholipids to maintain the liquid crystal phase over a wide temperature range.

   - **GmPM1** and GmPM28 contain small amounts of left-handed extended helical structures, termed poly(L-Pro)-type II (PPII)-like structures, at low temperatures.
