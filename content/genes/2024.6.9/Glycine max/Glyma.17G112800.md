## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.17G112800]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmKIX8-1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using forward genetic methods and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we identified and characterized the role of **GmKIX8-1** in the control of organ size in soybean.
   - **GmKIX8-1**, involved in the control of cell proliferation and organ size through forward and reverse genetics using FN mutagenesis and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, respectively.
   - **GmKIX8-1** belongs to a family of KIX domain-containing proteins that negatively regulate cell proliferation in plants. Consistent with this predicted function, we found that loss-of-function **GmKIX8-1** mutants showed a significant increase in the size of aerial plant organs, such as seeds and leaves.
   - Lastly, molecular analysis of soybean germplasms harboring the qSw17-1 QTL for the big-seeded phenotype indicated that reduced expression of **GmKIX8-1** is the genetic basis of the qSw17-1 phenotype.
