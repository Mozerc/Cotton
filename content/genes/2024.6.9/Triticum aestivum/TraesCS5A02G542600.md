## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS5A02G542600]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TraesCS5A02G542600</u>
- **Gene Name:** transmembrane transporter
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We identified putative candidate genes that are potentially involved in metal uptake, transport, and assimilation, including **TraesCS5A02G542600** on chromosome 5A, which was annotated as a Major Facilitator Superfamily transporter and acted on all the minerals except K.
   - **TraesCS5A02G542600** was highly expressed in seed coat, and to a lesser extent in the peduncle, awns, and lemma.
   - **TraesCS5A02G542600** at 5A showed the highest expression in most of the organs and tissues, indicating that they play vital roles during growth, filling, and development.
   - It was linked to the gene **TraesCS5A02G542600**, which encodes a transmembrane transporter belonging to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MSF).
