## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TabZIP28</u>
- **Gene Name:** bZIP transcription factor 28
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knockout of the homologue **TabZIP28** in common wheat resulted in declines of both the transcription and activity of cytosolic AGPase in developing endosperms and c. 4% reduction of the total starch in mature grains.
   - Transcription and activity of cytosolic AGPase are hampered in **TabZIP28** knockout wheat.
   - These data indicated that both the transcription and the activity of cytosolic AGPase in **TabZIP28** knockout wheat were reduced.
   - TubZIP28 and **TabZIP28** are transcriptional activators of starch synthesis first identified in wheat, and they could be superior targets to improve the starch content and yield potential of wheat.
