## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS2A02G504600]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCSN5-2A</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Found that the transcript levels of wheat TaCSN5 were induced in response to inoculation with Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and treatment with salicylic acid (SA).
   - Overexpression of TaCSN5 in Arabidopsis resulted in increased susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 infection accompanied by down-regulation of AtPR1 expression. 
   - Overexpression of TaCSN5 in wheat lines significantly increased susceptibility to Pst accompanied by decreased SA accumulation, whereas TaCSN5-RNAi wheat lines exhibited opposite trends.
   - TaCSN5 negatively regulated TaG3NPR1 genes involved in the SA signalling pathway. In addition, TaCSN5-RNAi lines showed increased resistance to multiple races of Pst.
