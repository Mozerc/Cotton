## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaMYB72</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The wheat MYB-related transcription factor **TaMYB72** promotes flowering in rice.
   - **TaMYB72** is a MYB family transcription factor localized to the nucleus. Three **TaMYB72** homologs, **TaMYB72**-A, **TaMYB72**-B and **TaMYB72**-D, cloned from hexaploid wheat were mapped to the short arm of the group 6 chromosomes. 
   - Over-expression of the **TaMYB72** in rice shortened the flowering time by approximately 12â€‰d. Expression analyses suggest that **TaMYB72** may function through up-regulation of florigen genes Hd3a and RFT1.
   - The function of the wheat **TaMYB72** gene was characterized by examining its heterologous expression in rice. These results provide important cues for thoroughly understanding the function and mechanisms of **TaMYB72**.
