## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaUGT12887|Qfhs.ifa-5A</u>
- **Gene Name:** UDP-glycosyltransferase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaUGT12887|Qfhs.ifa-5A**, was identified a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferase gene, designated **TaUGT12887|Qfhs.ifa-5A**, exhibiting a positive difference in response to the pathogen in lines harbouring both QTLs relative to lines carrying only the **TaUGT12887|Qfhs.ifa-5A** resistance allele, suggesting Fhb1 dependence of this transcript.
   - The complete cDNA of **TaUGT12887|Qfhs.ifa-5A** was reconstituted from available wheat genomic sequences, and a synthetic recoded gene was expressed in a toxin-sensitive strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
   - Spotting assays showed that **TaUGT12887|Qfhs.ifa-5A** conferred only weak resistance against DON compared with the barley DON-inactivating HvUGT13248, although the proteins were highly expressed in cell extracts, as confirmed by immunodetection of the N-terminal c-Myc tag.
   - **TaUGT12887|Qfhs.ifa-5A** only exhibits weak activity against DON compared with HvUGT13248 from barley.
