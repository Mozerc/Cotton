## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCT1-5D</u>
- **Gene Name:** copper transporter1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identification and characterization of a novel copper transporter gene family TaCT1 in common wheat.
   - Here, we report a novel copper transporter gene family, TaCT1, in common wheat. Three TaCT1 homoeologous genes were isolated and assigned to group 5 chromosomes.
   - TaCT1 genes exhibited higher transcript levels in leaf than in root, culm and spikelet. Excess copper down-regulated the transcript levels of TaCT1 and copper deficiency-induced TaCT1 expression. Subcellular experiments localized the TaCT1 to the Golgi apparatus.
   - By yeast expression experiments and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) analysis, TaCT1 was proven to have a function in Cu transport, and the key amino acid sites for Cu transport activity in TaCT1 protein were analysed by site-directed mutagenesis.
