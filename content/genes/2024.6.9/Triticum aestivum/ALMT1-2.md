## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ALMT1-2</u>
- **Gene Name:** aluminum-activated malate transporter
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we report on the cloning of a wheat gene, ALMT1,that co-segregates with Al tolerance in F2 and F3 populations derived from crosses between near-isogenic wheat lines that differ in Al tolerance.
   - The ALMT1 gene encodes a membrane protein, which is constitutively expressed in the root apices of the Al-tolerant line at greater levels than in the near-isogenic but Al-sensitive line.
   - ALMT1 increased the tolerance of tobacco cells to Al treatment. These findings demonstrate that ALMT1 encodes an Al-activated malate transporter that is capable of conferring Al tolerance to plant cells.
   - Taken together, these results indicate that both ALMT1-1 and **ALMT1-2** genes encode Al-activated transporters that facilitate malate efflux from tobacco cells, and that the expression of both ALMT1 genes increases Al tolerance by decreasing the accumulation of Al in cells.
