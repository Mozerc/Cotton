## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaGS2-2Aa</u>
- **Gene Name:** glutamine synthetase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic expression of TaGS2-2Ab significantly increased GS2 abundance and GS activity in leaves.
   - Analysis of N use-related traits showed that transgenic expression of TaGS2-2Ab increased root ability to acquire N, N uptake before and after flowering, remobilization of N to grains and N harvest index.
   - Field experiments showed that transgenic expression of TaGS2-2Ab driven by its own promoter increased the growth and nitrate influx rate of the roots, postanthesis N uptake, leaf functional duration, NHI, grain N concentration and grain yield under both low and high N conditions.
   - These results suggest that TaGS2 plays important role in N use, and the favourable allele TaGS2-2Ab is valuable in engineering wheat with improved N use efficiency and grain yield.
