## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaRSL4-A</u>
- **Gene Name:** ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6-LIKE 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Altered expression of TaRSL4 gene by genome interplay shapes root hair length in allopolyploid wheat.
   - The expression of wheat gene TaRSL4, an orthologue of AtRSL4 controlling the root hair development in Arabidopsis, was positively correlated with the root hair length in diploid and allotetraploid wheats.
   - Transcript abundance of TaRSL4 homoeologue from A genome (**TaRSL4-A**) was much higher than those of other genomes in natural allopolyploid wheat. 
   - Increased root hair length by overexpression of the **TaRSL4-A** in wheat led to enhanced shoot fresh biomass under nutrient-poor conditions.
   - Our observations indicate that increased root hair length in allohexaploid wheat originated in the allotetraploid progenitors and altered expression of TaRSL4 gene by genome interplay shapes root hair length in allopolyploid wheat.
