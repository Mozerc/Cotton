## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS2D02G229100.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCPK5</u>
- **Gene Name:** Ca2+-dependent protein kinase 5
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - TaTHI2 interacts with Ca2+-dependent protein kinase **TaCPK5** to suppress virus infection by regulating ROS accumulation.
   - TaTHI2 also interacted with the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase 5 (**TaCPK5**), which is localized in the plasma membrane, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by repressing **TaCPK5**-mediated activity of the catalase protein TaCAT1. 
   - Our results showed that TaTHI2 reduced the pIMAGO signal of **TaCPK5** in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that **TaCPK5** had autophosphorylation activity and that the autophosphorylation activity of **TaCPK5** was repressed by TaTHI2.
   - We then investigated the role of TaTHI2 in plant immunity and found that it interacts with **TaCPK5** to repress its kinase activity.
