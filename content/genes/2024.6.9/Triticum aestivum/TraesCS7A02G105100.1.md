## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS7A02G105100.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCRK3</u>
- **Gene Name:** cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase **TaCRK3** contributes to defense against Rhizoctonia cerealis in wheat.
   - Identified a novel cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase (CRK)-encoding gene, designated as **TaCRK3**, and investigated its role in defense against R. cerealis.
   - **TaCRK3** transcript abundance was significantly elevated by R. cerealis and exogenous ethylene treatments. Silencing of **TaCRK3** significantly compromised resistance to R. cerealis and repressed expression of an ethylene biosynthesis enzyme-encoding gene, ACO2, and a subset of defense-associated genes in wheat, whose transcript levels are up-regulated by ethylene stimulus.
   - These results suggest that **TaCRK3** mediates wheat resistance to R. cerealis through direct antifungal activity and heightening the expression of defense-associated genes in the ethylene signaling pathway.
