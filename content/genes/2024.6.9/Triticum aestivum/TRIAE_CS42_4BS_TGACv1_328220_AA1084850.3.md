## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TRIAE_CS42_4BS_TGACv1_328220_AA1084850.3]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaRSL2-4B</u>
- **Gene Name:** ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIX-LIKE 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Altered expression of the TaRSL2 gene contributed to variation in root hair length during allopolyploid wheat evolution.
   - Expression of the TaRSL2 gene positively correlates with variation in root hair length of different wheat species.
   - Altered expression of the TaRSL2 gene was positively correlated with variation in root hair length during allopolyploid wheat evolution, and overexpression of TaRSL2 in Arabidopsis increases root hair length.
   - We propose that altered expression of the TaRSL2 gene contributed to variation in root hair length in allopolyploid wheats.
