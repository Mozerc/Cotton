## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SBEIIa</u>
- **Gene Name:** starch branching enzyme IIa
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Increasing the amylose content of durum wheat through silencing of the **SBEIIa**genes.
   - In this work, genes encoding starch branching enzymes of class II (**SBEIIa**) were silenced using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique in two cultivars of durum wheat, using two different methods of transformation (biolistic and Agrobacterium).
   - Amylose content was markedly increased in the durum wheat transgenic lines exhibiting **SBEIIa** gene silencing.
   - We have found that the silencing of **SBEIIa** genes in durum wheat causes obvious alterations in granule morphology and starch composition, leading to high amylose wheat.
