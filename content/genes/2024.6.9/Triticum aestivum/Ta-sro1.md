## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Ta-sro1</u>
- **Gene Name:** SIMILAR TO RCD-ONE 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Both the overexpression of **Ta-sro1** in wheat and its heterologous expression in Arabidopsis promote the accumulation of ROS, mainly by enhancing the activity of NADPH oxidase and the expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, in conjunction with the suppression of alternative oxidase expression.
   - Constitutive Expression of **Ta-sro1** Increased ROS Production and Enhanced Stress Tolerance in Arabidopsis.
   - **Ta-sro1** plays an important role in DNA damage repair and genomic integrity through its PARP activity, by which it copes with the abiotic stresses and maintains plant growth.
   - It is therefore possible that **Ta-sro1** represses the alternative pathway by repressing AOX1a expression, thereby promoting the efficiency of ATP synthesis. This also implies that energy homeostasis is the basis of the stress tolerance.
