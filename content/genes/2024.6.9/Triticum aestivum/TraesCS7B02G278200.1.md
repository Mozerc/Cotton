## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS7B02G278200.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaTHI2-7B</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - TaTHI2 interacts with Ca2+-dependent protein kinase TaCPK5 to suppress virus infection by regulating ROS accumulation.
   - The results indicated that the expression of TaTHI2 can functionally complement the THI4 knock-out mutant strain of S. cerevisiae, suggesting that TaTHI2 should have a similar function to THI4 in thiamine biosynthesis. 
   - Overexpression of TaTHI2 (TaTHI2-OE) inhibited CWMV infection, while TaTHI2 silencing enhanced viral infection in wheat. Interestingly, the membrane-localized TaTHI2 protein was increased during CWMV infection. 
   - TaTHI2 also interacted with the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase 5 (TaCPK5), which is localized in the plasma membrane, and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by repressing TaCPK5-mediated activity of the catalase protein TaCAT1.
   - Our findings reveal a novel function of TaTHI2 in plant immunity and suggest its potential as a valuable gene for balancing disease resistance and wheat yield.
