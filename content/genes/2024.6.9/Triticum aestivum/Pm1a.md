## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Pm1a</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Pm1a**, the first powdery mildew resistance gene described in wheat, is part of a complex resistance (R) gene cluster located in a distal region of chromosome 7AL that has suppressed genetic recombination.
   - The cloning of **Pm1a** and its identification in a highly rearranged region of chromosome 7A provides insight into the role of chromosomal rearrangements in the evolution of this complex resistance cluster.
   - Two pathogen loci determine Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici virulence to wheat resistance gene **Pm1a**.
   - **Pm1a** encodes a typical NLR protein that triggers a hypersensitive immune reaction upon recognition of the pathogen-derived effector protein encoded by the avirulence (Avr) gene Avr**Pm1a**, which was also cloned using a B. graminis bi-parental mapping population.
