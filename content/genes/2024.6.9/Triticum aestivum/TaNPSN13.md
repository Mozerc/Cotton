## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaNPSN13</u>
- **Gene Name:** soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor 13
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cloned and characterized three NPSN genes (TaNPSN11, TaNPSN12, and **TaNPSN13**) and three plant defence-related SNARE homologues (TaSYP132, TaSNAP34, and TaMEMB12).
   - In virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assays, resistance of wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar Xingzi9104 to the Pst avirulent race CYR23 was reduced by knocking down TaNPSN11, **TaNPSN13** and TaSYP132, but not TaNPSN12, implying diversified functions of these wheat SNARE homologues in prevention of Pst infection and hyphal elongation.
   - The transcriptional regulation of the three TaNPSNs and TaSYP132 in wheat response to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) was characterized using qRT-PCR and their functions were further tested by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay.
