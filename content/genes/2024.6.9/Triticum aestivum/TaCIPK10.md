## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCIPK10</u>
- **Gene Name:** CBL-interacting protein kinase 10
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaCIPK10** interacts with and phosphorylates TaNH2 to activate wheat defense responses to stripe rust.
   - In vitro phosphorylation assay demonstrated that the kinase activity of **TaCIPK10** is regulated by Ca2+ and TaCBL4.
   - Knockdown **TaCIPK10** significantly reduced wheat resistance to Pst, whereas **TaCIPK10** overexpression resulted in enhanced wheat resistance to Pst by the induction of defense response in different aspects, including hypersensitive cell death, ROS accumulation and pathogenesis-relative genes expression.
   - Our results demonstrate that **TaCIPK10** positively regulate wheat resistance to Pst as molecular links between of Ca2+ and downstream components of defense response and **TaCIPK10** interacts with and phosphorylates TaNH2 to regulate wheat resistance to Pst.
   - **TaCIPK10** is significantly induced by Pst infection and SA treatment.
