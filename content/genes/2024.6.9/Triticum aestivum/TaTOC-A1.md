## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaTOC-A1</u>
- **Gene Name:** TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The tae-miR408-Mediated Control of TaTOC1 Genes Transcription Is Required for the Regulation of Heading Time in Wheat.
   - Wheat plants with a knockdown of TaTOC1s via RNA interference and overexpression of tae-miR408 showed early-heading phenotype.
   - TaTOC1s expression was down-regulated by the tae-miR408 in the hexaploid wheat. In addition, other important agronomic traits in wheat, such as plant height and flag leaf angle, were regulated by both tae-miR408 and TaTOC1s.
   - Our results suggested that the tae-miR408 functions in the wheat heading time by mediating TaTOC1s expression, and the study provides important new information on the mechanism underlying heading time regulation in wheat.
