## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaNF-YB4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Nuclear Factor Gamma4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Constitutive overexpression of the **TaNF-YB4** gene in transgenic wheat significantly improves grain yield.
   - A number of genes encoding NF-YB and NF-YC subunits were isolated from drought-tolerant wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. RAC875), and the impact of the overexpression of **TaNF-YB4** in the Australian wheat cultivar Gladius was investigated.
   - The growth and yield components of several independent transgenic lines with up-regulated levels of **TaNF-YB4** were evaluated under well-watered conditions (T1â€“T3 generations) and under mild drought (T2 generation).
   - Evaluation of transgenic wheat plants overexpressing **TaNF-YB4** in well-watered, droughted, and nutrient-depleted conditions.
