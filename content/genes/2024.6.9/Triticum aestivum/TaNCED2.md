## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaNCED2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The present study identified the complete coding sequences of a second NCED gene, designated as **TaNCED2**, and its homeologues (**TaNCED2**A, **TaNCED2**B and **TaNCED2**D) in hexaploid wheat, and characterized its functionality in seed dormancy and leaf dehydration tolerance using the **TaNCED2**A homeologue.
   - Ectopic expression of **TaNCED2**A and TaCYP707A1B in Arabidopsis resulted in altered seed ABA level and dormancy with no effect on leaf ABA content and transpirational water loss. 
   - Identified the complete CDS of a second NCED gene, designated as **TaNCED2**, and its three homeologues from hexaploid wheat, and investigated the function of one of its homeologue with respect to seed dormancy and leaf dehydration using heterologous expression in Arabidopsis.
   - To gain insights into the physiological roles of **TaNCED2** and TaCYP707A1 in wheat, the study examined their spatiotemporal expression patterns and determined the genomic contributions of transcripts to their total expression.
