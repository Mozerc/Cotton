## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaHKT2.1-7BL</u>
- **Gene Name:** high-affinity potassium uptake transporter2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The chromosomal region on 7AL containing TaHKT2|1 7AL-1 co-located with QTL for shoot Na+ concentration and yield in some saline environments.
   - Evidence indicated that neither TaHKT2|2 nor TaHKT2|1 were associated with primary root Na+ uptake but TaHKT2|1 may be associated with trait variation for Na+ exclusion and yield in some but not all saline environments.
   - A recent study, however, showed that TaHKT2|1 is a multigene family consisting of four functional genes and pseudogenes located on the long arm of homeologous group 7 chromosomes with evidence that the individual genes were not involved in controlling Na+ influx from the external medium into roots but may have a role in excluding Na+ from leaves or possibly involved in maintaining K+ status in the plant.
   - A two-fold down regulation in TaHKT2|1 7DL-1 expression and up to three-fold down regulation in TaHKT2|2 7AL-1 expression levels indicated that these genes were differentially regulated in control and NaCl treated conditions
