## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Ppd-D1</u>
- **Gene Name:** pseudo-response regulator
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Ppd-D1** is one of the most potent genes affecting the photoperiod response of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Only two alleles, insensitive **Ppd-D1**a and sensitive **Ppd-D1**b, were known previously, and these did not adequately explain the broad adaptation of wheat to photoperiod variation.
   - The transcript abundances of the **Ppd-D1** haplotypes showed continuous variation, being highest for haplotype I, lowest for haplotype III, and correlating negatively with varietal differences in heading time. 
   - These haplotypes also significantly affected other agronomic traits. The distribution frequency of **Ppd-D1** haplotypes showed partial correlations with both latitudes and altitudes of wheat cultivation regions.
   - The evolution, expression and distribution of **Ppd-D1** haplotypes were consistent evidentially with each other. What was regarded as a pair of alleles in the past can now be considered a series of alleles leading to continuous variation.
   - A Pseudo-Response Regulator is misexpressed in the photoperiod insensitive **Ppd-D1**a mutant of wheat.
