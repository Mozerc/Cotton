## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCBF15</u>
- **Gene Name:** C-repeat binding factor 15
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic barley lines prove the involvement of TaCBF14 and **TaCBF15** in the cold acclimation process and in frost tolerance.
   - The aim of the present work was the functional analysis of two wheat CBF transcription factors, namely TaCBF14 and **TaCBF15**, shown by previous experiments to play a role in the development of frost tolerance.
   - The analysis showed that TaCBF14 and **TaCBF15** transgenes improve the frost tolerance to such an extent that the transgenic lines were able to survive freezing temperatures several degrees lower than that which proved lethal for the wild-type spring barley.
   - Gene expression studies showed that HvCOR14b, HvDHN5, and HvDHN8 genes were up-regulated by TaCBF14 and **TaCBF15**.
