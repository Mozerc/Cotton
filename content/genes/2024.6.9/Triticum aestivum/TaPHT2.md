## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaPHT2|1</u>
- **Gene Name:** phosphate transporter 2-1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Function of wheat phosphate transporter gene **TaPHT2|1**|**TaPHT2|1** in Pi translocation and plant growth regulation under replete and limited Pi supply conditions.
   - Expression analysis revealed that **TaPHT2|1**|**TaPHT2|1** was strongly expressed in the leaves, was up-regulated by low Pi stress, and exhibited a circadian rhythmic expression pattern. **TaPHT2|1**|**TaPHT2|1**â€“green fluorescent protein fusions in the leaves of tobacco and wheat were specifically detected in the chloroplast envelop. 
   - The down-regulated expression of **TaPHT2|1**|**TaPHT2|1** resulted in reduced photosynthetic capacities, total P contents, and accumulated P amounts in plants under sufficient and deficient Pi conditions, eventually leading to worse plant growth phenotypes. 
   - The **TaPHT2|1**|**TaPHT2|1** knockdown plants exhibited pronounced decrease in accumulated phosphorus in sufficient and deficient Pi conditions, suggesting that **TaPHT2|1**|**TaPHT2|1** is an important factor to associate with a distinct P signaling that up-regulates other PT members to control Pi acquisition and translocation within plants.
   - **TaPHT2|1**|**TaPHT2|1** is a key member of the Pht2 family involved in Pi translocation, and that it can function in the improvement of phosphorus usage efficiency in wheat.
