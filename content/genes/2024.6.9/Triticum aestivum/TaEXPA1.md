## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaEXPA1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Expansin gene1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expansin genes play important roles in the regulation of cell size, as well as organ size. We found that all three **TaEXPA1** homoeologs were silenced in seedling roots.
   - Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the transcriptional silencing of three **TaEXPA1** homoeologs in roots was correlated with an increased level of H3K9 dimethylation and decreased levels of H3K4 trimethylation and H3K9 acetylation.
   - Reactivation of **TaEXPA1**-A and **TaEXPA1**-D expression in leaves was correlated with increased levels of H3K4 trimethylation and H3K9 acetylation, and decreased levels of H3K9 dimethylation in their promoters, respectively.
   - We demonstrated that epigenetic modifications contribute to the expression divergence of three **TaEXPA1** homoeologs during wheat development.
