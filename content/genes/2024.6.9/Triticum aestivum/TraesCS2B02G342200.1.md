## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS2B02G342200.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaGAPDH2-2B</u>
- **Gene Name:** glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2
- **Genome:** [Chinese_Spring1.0]()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Demonstrated that PstGSRE4 interacts with wheat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase TaGAPDH2, which is related to ROS signalling. 
   - Silencing of TaGAPDH2 by virus-induced gene silencing increased the accumulation of ROS induced by the Pst virulent race CYR31.
   - Overexpression of TaGAPDH2 decreased the accumulation of ROS induced by the avirulent Pst race CYR23.
   - Knocking down TaGAPDH2 expression attenuated Pst infection, whereas overexpression of TaGAPDH2 promoted Pst infection, indicating that TaGAPDH2 is a negative regulator of plant defence.
   - TaGAPDH2 is hijacked by the Pst effector as a negative regulator of plant immunity to promote Pst infection in wheat.
