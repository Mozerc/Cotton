## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TraesCS4D02G078100.2]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaSnRK2.10-4D</u>
- **Gene Name:** Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) acts as a signaling hub in the response to drought stress, but whether SnRK2 helps plants cope with water deficit via other mechanisms is largely unknown. Here, we cloned and characterized TaSnRK2.10, which was induced by multiple abiotic stresses and phytohormones.
   - TaSnRK2.10 expression varies among tissues and in response to phytohormones and abiotic stresses in wheat.
   - TaSnRK2.10s are involved in the response to drought stress.
   - TaSnRK2.10 confers drought tolerance by reducing water loss in transgenic rice.
   - Wheat TaSnRK2.10 phosphorylates TaERD15 and TaENO1 and confers drought tolerance when overexpressed in rice.
   - TaSnRK2.10 not only regulated stomatal aperture and the expression of drought-responsive genes, but also enhanced PEP supply and promoted the degradation of TaERD15, all of which enhanced drought tolerance.
