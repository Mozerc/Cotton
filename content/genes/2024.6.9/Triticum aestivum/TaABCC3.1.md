## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaABCC3.1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ABC transporter C family member 3 protein 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two variants of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family C transporter gene were cloned from DON-treated wheat mRNA, namely **TaABCC3.1** and TaABCC3.2. These represent two of three putative genes identified on chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D of the wheat genome sequence.
   - Variant **TaABCC3.1** represents the DON-responsive transcript previously associated with DON resistance in wheat.
   - Gene expression studies showed that **TaABCC3.1** is activated as part of the early host response to DON and in response to the FHB defence hormone jasmonic acid.
   - VIGS of TaABCC3 genes also reduced the grain number by more than 28% (P<0.05), both with and without DON treatment, and the effects were greater for the construct that targeted the two homeologues.
