## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaHsp26.5</u>
- **Gene Name:** HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 26.5
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of Capsicum annuum HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 26.5 (**CaHsp26.5**) was triggered by the inoculation of Tobacco mosaic virus pathotype P0 (TMV-P0) but its function in the defense response of plants is unknown.
   - An elevated **CaHsp26.5** level was accompanied by increased plant resistance against plant viruses such as Cucumber mosaic virus strain Korea.
   - **CaHsp26.5** binding to a short poly-cytosine motif in the 3'-untranslated region of the genome of some viruses triggers the expression of several defense-related genes such as PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENE 1 with the help of a transcription factor, NAC DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 81 (ATAF2).
   - Our work shows **CaHsp26.5** as a positive player in the plant defense response against several plant RNA viruses. However, some tobamoviruses can hijack **CaHsp26.5**â€™s chaperone activity for their own benefit.
