## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BoMYB29</u>
- **Gene Name:** Myb domain protein 29
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica oleracea*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We specifically focused on **BoMYB29**, a homolog of Arabidopsis MYB29/PMG2/HAG3, not only to characterize its function but also to demonstrate its usability as a biological resource. 
   - **BoMYB29** overexpression in wild-type Arabidopsis enhanced the expression of aliphatic GSL biosynthetic genes and the accumulation of aliphatic GSLs.
   - When expressed in the myb28myb29 mutant, which exhibited no detectable aliphatic GSLs, **BoMYB29** restored the expression of biosynthetic genes and aliphatic GSL accumulation.
   - Interestingly, the ratio of methylsulphinyl GSL content, including glucoraphanin, to that of methylthio GSLs was greatly increased, indicating the suitability of **BoMYB29** as a regulator for increasing methylsulphinyl GSL content.
