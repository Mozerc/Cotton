## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PaMYB10</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB transcriptional regulator 10
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Prunus avium*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The R2R3-MYB transcription factor **PaMYB10** is involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in apricots and determines red blushed skin.
   - Transient **PaMYB10** overexpression in ‘Luntaixiaobaixing’ fruits resulted in the red blushed skin at the maturation stage.
   - Real-time qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the transcript levels of **PaMYB10** and seven genes responsible for anthocyanin synthesis were significantly higher in blushed than in nonblushed apricots, which was consistent with the accumulation of anthocyanin.
   - Taken together, these data reveal that three anthocyanins are responsible for the blushed skin of apricots, identify **PaMYB10** as a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in apricots, and demonstrate that blush formation depends on light.
