## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [FvH4_2g29930]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FveYUC4</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria vesca*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Auxin biosynthesis gene **FveYUC4** is critical for leaf and flower morphogenesis in woodland strawberry.
   - Consistent with a role for **FveYUC4** in auxin synthesis, free auxin and its metabolites are significantly reduced in the yuc4 leaves and flowers.
   - This role of **FveYUC4** in leaf and flower development is supported by its high and specific expression in young leaves and flower buds using GUS reporters. 
   - Our data demonstrate that **FveYUC4** is essential for leaf and flower morphogenesis in woodland strawberry by providing auxin hormone at the proper time and in the right tissues.
   - **FveYUC4** overexpression results in the development of parthenocarpic strawberry fruit.
