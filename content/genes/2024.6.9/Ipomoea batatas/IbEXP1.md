## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>IbEXP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** expansin gene
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Ipomoea batatas*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expressions of **IbEXP1**, IbEXP2 and IbEXPL1 were significantly correlated with the changes in cell wall component content, and were related to the qualitative structure changes.
   - Down-regulation of the **IbEXP1** gene enhanced storage root development in sweetpotato.
   - The transcript level of **IbEXP1** was high in the fibrous root (FR) and petiole at the FR stage, but decreased significantly at the young storage root (YSR) stage.
   - Elongation growth of the epidermal cells was significantly reduced, and metaxylem and cambium cell proliferation was markedly enhanced in the FRs of **IbEXP1**-antisense plants, resulting in an earlier thickening growth in these plants relative to WT plants.
   - **IbEXP1** is the first sweetpotato gene whose role in SR development has been directly identified in soil-grown transgenic sweetpotato plants.
