## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>IbNAC1</u>
- **Gene Name:** NAC transcription factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Ipomoea batatas*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **IbNAC1** was constitutively expressed in root tissues and was induced earlier than sporamin following the wounding of leaves.
   - **IbNAC1** is constitutively expressed in root and tuber and responds earlier than sporamin in sweet potato leaves upon wounding.
   - These results demonstrate that **IbNAC1**, as well as sporamin, are activated by wounding signals, with both systemic and local responses.
   - **IbNAC1** reduced growth of the larvae and decreased insect feeding due to the high accumulation of TPI resulting from the enhanced sporamin expression in sweet potato.
   - We assumed that the effect of **IbNAC1** was simultaneously associated with a reduced antioxidant potential upon wounding to activate JA-mediated ROS defense in sweet potato.
