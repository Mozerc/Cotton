## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvMADS28</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In this study, we demonstrate an essential role for the grapevine MADS-box gene **VvMADS28** in morphogenesis of the ovule. We found that **VvMADS28** mRNA accumulated in the ovules of a seeded cultivar, ‘Red Globe’, throughout the course of ovule and seed development, especially within the integument/seed coat. In contrast, in the seedless cultivar ‘Thompson Seedless’, **VvMADS28** was expressed only weakly in ovules, and this was associated with increased levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) within the **VvMADS28** promoter region.
   - Heterologous overexpression of **VvMADS28** in transgenic tomatoes interfered with sepal development and resulted in smaller fruit but did not obviously affect seed size.
   - **VvMADS28** protein specifically binds to the promoter of the grapevine WUSCHEL (VvWUS) gene, suggesting that maintenance of the **VvMADS28**–VvMADS5 dimer and VvWUS expression homeostasis influences seed development.
   - Taken together, our results provide insight into regulatory mechanisms of ovule and seed development associated with **VvMADS28**.
