## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Vitvi17g00102]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvWRKY1</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY-type DNA binding protein 1
- **Genome:** [grape reference genome (https://plants.ensembl.org/Vitis_vinifera/Info/Index)]()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTâ€“qPCR) verification revealed that the promising candidate transcription factor genes VvMYB4-like, VvERF113, VvWRKY31, **VvWRKY1**, and VvNAC83 may regulate cell wall metabolism candidate gene expression for grape berry texture changes.
   - The expression of candidate genes for cell wall metabolism showed a trend similar to that of VvMYB4-like, VvERF113, VvWRKY31, **VvWRKY1**, and VvNAC83.
   - **VvWRKY1** gene expression in grape is regulated in a developmental manner in berries and leaves and by various signal molecules involved in defence such as salicylic acid, ethylene, and hydrogen peroxide.
   - Functional analysis of **VvWRKY1** was performed by overexpression in tobacco, and transgenic plants exhibited reduced susceptibility to various fungi but not to viruses. These results are consistent with a possible role for **VvWRKY1** in grapevine defence against fungal pathogens.
   - Isolation and characterization of a Vitis vinifera transcription factor, **VvWRKY1**, and its effect on responses to fungal pathogens in transgenic tobacco plants.
