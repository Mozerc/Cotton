## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_07s0005g00390]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvBG2</u>
- **Gene Name:** β-glucosidase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - At this point in the culture, our results suggest that of those genes involved in ABA accumulation, one (VvNCED1) was repressed, while another (**VvBG2**) was activated. Similarly, of those genes related to a reduction in ABA levels, one (VvUGT) was repressed while another (VvHyd2) was activated.
   - The expression of the **VvBG2** gene, encoding a β-glucosidase (BG) enzyme, increased significantly in embryogenic aggregates starting from the third week of culture over the semipermeable membrane.
   - In addition, the data from the relative gene expression of ABA-producing (VvNCED1 and **VvBG2**) and ABA-degrading (VvUGT and VvHyd2) genes suggested another important point of control of ABA levels during the differentiation of grapevine somatic embryos in the fourth week of culture over the semipermeable membrane.
