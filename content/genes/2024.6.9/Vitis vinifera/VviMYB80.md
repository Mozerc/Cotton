## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VviMYB80</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB transcription factor 80
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **VviMYB80** Gene is Abnormally Expressed in Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Zhong Shan Hong’ and its Expression in Tobacco Driven by the 35S Promoter Causes Male Sterility.
   - Expression of the **VviMYB80** gene, driven by the 35S promoter, caused pleiotropic effects on the stamens, including smaller and shriveled anthers, delayed dehiscence, fewer seeds, shorter anther filaments, distorted pollen shape and a lack of cytoplasm, with the tapetum exhibiting hypertrophy in transformed tobacco.
   - **VviMYB80** represents a R2R3-MYB transcription factor potentially involved in the control of pollen development and may indirectly regulate the phenylpropanoid pathway in plants. This work also provides an alternative mechanism for producing female lines required for hybrid production in horticultural and crop species.
   - These results suggest that **VviMYB80** may play an important role in stamen development and that expression of **VviMYB80** driven by the 35S promoter in tobacco induces male sterility.
