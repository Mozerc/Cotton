## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [GSVIVT01008065001]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvHB58</u>
- **Gene Name:** homeobox 58
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The grapevine homeobox gene **VvHB58** influences seed and fruit development through multiple hormonal signaling pathways.
   - The **VvHB58** gene was differentially expressed during seed development between seedless and seeded cultivars. Subcellular localization assays revealed that the **VvHB58** protein was located in the nucleus.
   - Transgenic expression of **VvHB58** in tomato led to loss of apical dominance, a reduction in fruit pericarp expansion, reduced fruit size and seed number, and larger endosperm cells.
   - **VvHB58** has a potential function in regulating fruit and seed development by impacting multiple hormonal pathways.
