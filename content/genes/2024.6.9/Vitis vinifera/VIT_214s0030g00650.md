## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_214s0030g00650]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvSDH4</u>
- **Gene Name:** hikimate dehydrogenase 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two shikimate dehydrogenases, VvSDH3 and **VvSDH4**, are involved in gallic acid biosynthesis in grapevine.
   - VvSDH3 and **VvSDH4**, mainly expressed in immature berry tissues in which galloylated flavan-3-ols are accumulated, encoded enzymes with lower ‘classical’ activity but were able to produce gallic acid in vitro.
   - The over-expression of **VvSDH4** in hairy-roots increased the content of aromatic amino acids and hydroxycinnamates, but had little or no effect on molecules more distant from the shikimate pathway (stilbenoids and flavan-3-ols).
   - VvSDH3 and **VvSDH4** are good candidates for GA biosynthesis in immature grape berry tissues. However, other molecular actors involved in GA transport and PA galloylation remain to be identified.
