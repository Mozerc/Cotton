## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VvZIP3</u>
- **Gene Name:** zinc transporter protein3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of a putative grapevine Zn transporter, **VvZIP3**, suggests its involvement in early reproductive development in Vitis vinifera L.
   - Compared to other members of the ZIP family identified in the Vitis vinifera L. genome, **VvZIP3** is mainly expressed in reproductive tissue - specifically in developing flowers - which correlates with the high Zn accumulation in these organs.
   - Contrary to this, the low expression of **VvZIP3** in parthenocarpic berries shows a relationship with the lower Zn accumulation in this tissue than in normal seeded berries where its expression is induced by Zn.
   - **VvZIP3** complemented the growth defect of a yeast Zn-uptake mutant, ZHY3, and is localized in the plasma membrane of plant cells, suggesting that **VvZIP3** has the function of a Zn uptake transporter.
