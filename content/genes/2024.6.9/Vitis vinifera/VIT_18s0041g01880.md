## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [VIT_18s0041g01880]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VviAGL11</u>
- **Gene Name:** AGAMOUS-LIKE 11
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **VviAGL11** self-regulates and targets hormone- and secondary metabolism-related genes during seed development.
   - **VviAGL11**, the Arabidopsis SEEDSTICK homolog, has been proposed to have a causative role in grapevine stenospermocarpy.
   - **VviAGL11** was shown to co-localize with its targets in the outer seed coat integument, supporting its direct involvement in seed development, possibly by orchestrating the crosstalk among MeJA, auxin, and isoflavonoids synthesis.
   - The dominant-negative effect of the mutated **VviAGL11** CDS on the target genes activation was molecularly validated. A new regulatory mechanism correlating **VviAGL11** haplotype assortment and seedlessness class in grapevine is proposed.
