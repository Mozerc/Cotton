## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PaCBF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** C-repeat binding factor1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Phalaenopsis aphrodite*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cold Response in Phalaenopsis aphrodite and Characterization of **PaCBF1** and PaICE1.
   - At the molecular level, C-repeat binding factor1 (**PaCBF1**) and its putative target gene dehydrin1 (PaDHN1) mRNAs were induced by cold, whereas inducer of CBF expression1 (PaICE1) mRNA was constitutively expressed.
   - PaICE1 transactivated MYC motifs in the **PaCBF1** promoter, indicating that up-regulation of **PaCBF1** may be mediated by the binding of PaICE1 to MYC motifs. Overexpression of **PaCBF1** in transgenic Arabidopsis induced AtCOR6.6 and RD29a without cold stimulus and maintained better membrane integrity after cold stress.
   - Herein, we present evidence that cold induction of **PaCBF1** transcripts in P. aphrodite may be transactivated by PaICE1 and consequently protect plants from cold damage through up-regulation of cold-regulated (COR) genes, such as DHN.
