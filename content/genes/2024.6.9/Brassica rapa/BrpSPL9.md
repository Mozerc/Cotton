## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BrpSPL9</u>
- **Gene Name:** squamosa promoter-binding-like protein 9
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica rapa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **BrpSPL9**-2 (B. rapa ssp. pekinensis SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE 9-2), a target gene of microRNA brp-miR156, controls the heading time of Chinese cabbage.
   - Overexpression of a mutated miR156-resistant form of **BrpSPL9**-2 caused the significant earliness of heading, concurrent with shortening of the seedling and rosette stages.
   - Morphological analysis reveals that the significant earliness of heading in the transgenic plants overexpressing **BrpSPL9**-2 gene was produced because the juvenile phase was absent and the early adult phase shortened, whereas the significant delay of folding in the transgenic plants overexpressing Brp-MIR156a was due to prolongation of the juvenile and early adult phases.
   - miR156 and **BrpSPL9** genes are potentially important for genetic improvement of earliness of Chinese cabbage and other crops.
