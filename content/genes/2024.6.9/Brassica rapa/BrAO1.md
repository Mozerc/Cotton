## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BrAO1</u>
- **Gene Name:** aldehyde oxidase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica rapa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Increase in **BrAO1** gene expression and aldehyde oxidase activity during clubroot development in Chinese cabbage.
   - Isolated two AO genes (**BrAO1** and BrAO2) from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis cv. Muso), which are the most similar to AAO1 among Arabidopsis AO genes, and examined their expressions during clubroot development.
   - Coincidental with **BrAO1** expression, the signals of BrAO-a and BrAO-d increased with inoculation by P. brassicae during clubroot development compared with healthy roots, resulting in an increase in total AO activity.
   - Suggesting that **BrAO1** expression was enhanced by the pathogen in order to establish its pathogenesis.
