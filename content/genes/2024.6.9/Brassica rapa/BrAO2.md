## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BrAO2</u>
- **Gene Name:** aldehyde oxidase2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica rapa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Increase in BrAO1 gene expression and aldehyde oxidase activity during clubroot development in Chinese cabbage.
   - Isolated two AO genes (BrAO1 and **BrAO2**) from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis cv. Muso), which are the most similar to AAO1 among Arabidopsis AO genes, and examined their expressions during clubroot development.
   - Thereafter, BrAO1 expression increased with clubroot development compared with uninoculated roots, although **BrAO2** expression was repressed.
   - These findings suggest that the expression of BrAO1 was stimulated by infection with P. brassicae to increase AO activity during clubroot formation as a substitute for reduced **BrAO2** expression.
