## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Bra039662]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BramMDH1</u>
- **Gene Name:** mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 1
- **Genome:** [Brassica database (http://brassicadb.org/brad/).]()
- **Species:** *Brassica rapa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional analyses demonstrated that the candidate gene **BramMDH1** (mMDH: mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase) directly enhances organic acids and photosynthesis to increase heat-tolerance and growth rate in Arabidopsis.
   - Aza-treated B. rapa, which also has elevated **BramMDH1** levels, did not exhibit enhanced heat-tolerance. 
   - Physiological and molecular analyses were used to obtain a thorough understanding of the regulation of cross-adaptation. In addition, the function of the candidate gene **BramMDH1** is further discussed.
   - Over-expression of **BramMDH1** in Arabidopsis leads to increased heat tolerance and growth rate.
