## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LjIPT3</u>
- **Gene Name:** isopentenyltransferase3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lotus japonicus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knockdown of **LjIPT3** influences nodule development in Lotus japonicus.
   - **LjIPT3** was undetectable in the nodule primordia and developing nodules, and later it was expressed only in the vascular bundles of mature nodules.
   - knockdown of **LjIPT3** (**LjIPT3**i) by RNA interference reduced levels of endogenous cytokinins, affected plant development and accelerated Chl degradation during dark-induced leaf senescence.
   - Therefore, our results indicate that the **LjIPT3** gene product is required for nodule initiation and development, and does not appear to be involved in early infection events.
