## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LjENOD40–2</u>
- **Gene Name:** early nodulin-2 protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lotus japonicus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two ENOD40 genes of L. japonicus were specifically expressed in the nodule formation process, but they showed different expression patterns upon infection.
   - Each ENOD40 gene demonstrates an individual specificity and regulation with regard to rhizobial infection.
   - Although **LjENOD40–2** expression failed to be enhanced in nodule primordia induced by Nod factors, **LjENOD40–2** showed a high level of expression in nodule primordia induced by rhizobia and in nodules. The results indicate that **LjENOD40–2** is not a pseudogene, and has a role in nodule formation.
   - We confirm that **LjENOD40–2** is not induced during 48 h of symbiotic signal perception and there is a significant difference between the expression of LjENOD40–1 and **LjENOD40–2** at the early stage of nodulation.
