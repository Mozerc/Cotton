## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc09g089580]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlE8|Sl27DOX</u>
- **Gene Name:** C-27 hydroxylase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Induced mutations in **SlE8|Sl27DOX** and SlACO1 control tomato fruit maturation and shelf-life.
   - The data demonstrated that slaco1-1 and slaco1-2 alleles could be used to improve fruit shelf-life, and that **SlE8|Sl27DOX**-1 and **SlE8|Sl27DOX**-2 alleles could be used to accelerate ripening.
   - Tomato E8 Encodes a C-27 Hydroxylase in Metabolic Detoxification of α-Tomatine during Fruit Ripening.
   - E8/**SlE8|Sl27DOX** functions as a C-27 hydroxylase of lycoperoside C in the metabolic detoxification of α-tomatine during tomato fruit ripening, and the efficient detoxification by E8/27DOX may provide an advantage in the domestication of cultivated tomatoes.
   - These results demonstrated that **SlE8|Sl27DOX** is a negative regulator of ethylene biosynthesis during flowering and fruit development.
   - This study highlights further the importance of SlACO1 and **SlE8|Sl27DOX** in ethylene production in tomato fruit and how they might be used for post-harvest fruit preservation or speeding up fruit maturation.
