## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc10g078990]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlHair2|H2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SlHair2|H2** Regulates the Initiation and Elongation of Type I Trichomes on Tomato Leaves and Stems.
   - The number and length of type I trichomes on the leaves and stems of knock-out **SlHair2|H2** plants were reduced when compared to the wild-type, while overexpression increased their number and length. 
   - **SlHair2|H2** is a transcriptional regulator and that it interacts with Wo in planta, implying that this protein complex regulates the development of type I trichomes.
   - These results suggest that **SlHair2|H2** has a role in the initiation and elongation of type I trichomes in tomato.
