## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc09g015080]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlTBP</u>
- **Gene Name:** tocopherol-binding protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SlTBP** encodes a chloroplast-targeted protein of the patellin family and is highly expressed in green tissues.
   - **SlTBP** plays a role in maintaining chloroplast structural integrity and affects lipid composition.
   - Having demonstrated that **SlTBP** silencing affected the tocopherol levels and, consequently, impacted on photosynthetic function, lipid peroxidation and plastidial membrane ultrastructure, we next evaluated how tocopherol deficiency affects lipid metabolism.
   - The collection of evidence as a whole, rather than any single individual piece, allow us to propose that **SlTBP** plays a novel function in plants, mediating the role of tocopherol in inter-/intraorganellar communication.
