## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc11g012720]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlGT31</u>
- **Gene Name:** GT factor31
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Trihelix transcription factor **SlGT31** regulates fruit ripening mediated by ethylene in tomato.
   - We cloned **SlGT31**, encoding a trihelix protein in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and determined that its relative expression was significantly induced by the application of exogenous ethylene whereas it was repressed by the ethylene-inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene.
   - Suppression of **SlGT31** expression resulted in delayed fruit ripening, decreased accumulation of total carotenoids, and reduced ethylene content, together with inhibition of expression of genes related to ethylene and fruit ripening.
   - **SlGT31**-overexpression lines showed opposite results. Yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays indicated that **SlGT31** can bind to the promoters of two key ethylene-biosynthesis genes, ACO1 and ACS4. Taken together, our results indicate that **SlGT31** might act as a positive modulator during fruit ripening.
