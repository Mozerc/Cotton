## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc01g098110]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>pyp1</u>
- **Gene Name:** PALE YELLOW PETAL 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identification of the carotenoid modifying gene PALE YELLOW PETAL 1 as an essential factor in xanthophyll esterification and yellow flower pigmentation in tomato.
   - Functional disruption of **pyp1** resulted in loss of xanthophyll esters, which was associated with a reduction in the total carotenoid content and disruption of normal chromoplast development.
   - Next-generation sequencing coupled with map-based positional cloning identified the mutant alleles responsible for the **pyp1** phenotype. **pyp1** most likely encodes a carotenoid modifying protein that plays a vital role in the production of xanthophyll esters in tomato anthers and petals.
   - **pyp1** most likely encodes a carotenoid modifying gene, which appears to function in the production of xanthophyll esters in the yellow-colored floral organs of tomato.
