## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LeMAN2</u>
- **Gene Name:** mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Specific role of **LeMAN2** in the control of seed germination exposed by overexpression of the LeMAN3 gene in tomato plants.
   - **LeMAN2** is active in the micropylar area prior to germination and LeMAN1 is active after germination in all endosperm cells surrounding the cotyledons.
   - Detailed RT-PCR analyses revealed the transcription patterns of the genes encoding the various mannanase isoforms, and indicated a delay in **LeMAN2** transcription in the endosperm cap of the transgenic seeds.
   - These results indicate that overexpression of active endo-Î²-mannanase in the endosperm cap is not sufficient to enable hydrolysis of the cell walls or to promote germination of tomato seeds. Cell-wall hydrolysis in these endosperm cells is under tight control and requires the specific activity of **LeMAN2**.
