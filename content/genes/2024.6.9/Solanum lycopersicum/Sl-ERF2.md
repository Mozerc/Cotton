## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Sl-ERF2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Ethylene response factor2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Sl-ERF2**, a Tomato Ethylene Response Factor Involved in Ethylene Response and Seed Germination.
   - **Sl-ERF2** is expressed in all plant tissues tested, though its transcript accumulates preferentially in germinating seeds and ripening fruit.
   - Overexpression of the **Sl-ERF2** gene in transgenic tomato lines results in premature seed germination and enhanced hook formation of dark-grown seedlings, which is indicative of increased ethylene sensitivity.
   - It is noteworthy that the exaggerated hook phenotype is abolished when ethylene perception is blocked, strongly suggesting that **Sl-ERF2** requires other ethylene-dependent components to impact the hook formation process.
