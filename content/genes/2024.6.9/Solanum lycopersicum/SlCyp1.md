## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlCyp1</u>
- **Gene Name:** low-temperature-induced cysteine proteinase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we show that, in tomato, translocation of a phloem-mobile cyclophilin, **SlCyp1**, from a wild-type scion into a mutant rootstock results in restoration of vascular development and lateral root initiation.
   - We show that long-distance trafficking of **SlCyp1** is associated with regulation of the shoot-to-root ratio in response to changing light intensities, by modulating root growth.
   - **SlCyp1** is a key player in the signal transduction pathway that is required for maintaining a physiologically balanced shoot-to-root ratio under the prevailing environmental conditions.
   - We conclude that long-distance trafficking of **SlCyp1** acts as a rheostat to control the shoot-to-root ratio, by mediating root development to integrate photosynthesis and light intensity with requirements for access to water and mineral nutrients.
