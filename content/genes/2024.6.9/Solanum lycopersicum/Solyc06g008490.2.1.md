## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc06g008490.2.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlJMJ6</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Found that the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) **SlJMJ6** encodes a histone lysine demethylase that specifically demethylates H3K27 methylation.
   - Overexpression of **SlJMJ6** accelerates tomato fruit ripening, which is associated with the upregulated expression of a large number of ripening-related genes.
   - Numerous **SlJMJ6**-regulated genes are involved in transcription regulation, ethylene biosynthesis, cell wall degradation and hormone signaling.
   - Our results demonstrate that **SlJMJ6** is a ripening-prompting H3K27me3 demethylase that activates the expression of the ripening-related genes by modulating H3K27me3, thereby facilitating tomato fruit ripening.
