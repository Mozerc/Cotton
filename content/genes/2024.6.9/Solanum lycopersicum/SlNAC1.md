## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlNAC1</u>
- **Gene Name:** NAC transcription factor1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of tomato **SlNAC1**transcription factor alters fruit pigmentation and softening.
   - Tissue-specific analysis by quantitative real-time PCR showed that **SlNAC1** was highly accumulated in immature green fruits| the expression of **SlNAC1** increased with fruit ripening till to the highest level at 7 d after the breaker stage.
   - The overexpression of **SlNAC1** resulted in reduced carotenoids by altering carotenoid pathway flux and decreasing ethylene synthesis mediated mainly by the reduced expression of ethylene biosynthetic genes of system-2, thus led to yellow or orange mature fruits.
   - Overexpression of **SlNAC1** reduced the firmness of the fruits and the thickness of the pericarp and produced more abscisic acid, resulting in the early softening of fruits.
   - **SlNAC1**, a stress-related transcription factor, is fine-tuned on both the transcriptional and the post-translational level.
   - We present evidence implicating **SlNAC1**, a new member of the NAC domain protein family from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), in Tomato leaf curl virus (TLCV) REn function. 
   - Hence, in **SlNAC1** overexpression lines, both ethylene-dependent and abscisic acid-dependent pathways are regulated by **SlNAC1** in fruit ripening regulatory network.
