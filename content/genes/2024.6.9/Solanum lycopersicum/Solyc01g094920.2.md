## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc01g094920.2]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlRLK-like</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SlRLK-like** is a malectin-like domain protein affecting localization and abundance of LeEIX2 receptor resulting in suppression of EIX-induced immune responses.
   - **SlRLK-like** associated with the RLK FLS2, resulting in its degradation and concomitantly a reduction of the flagellin 22 (flg22)-induced burst of reactive oxygen species.
   - Knockout of **SlRLK-like** using the CRISPR/Cas9 system increased EIX-induced ethylene production and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (SlACS2) gene expression in tomato.
   - Our findings suggest that **SlRLK-like** leads to a decreased stability of various PRRs, leading to a reduction in their abundance and resulting in attenuation of defense responses.
