## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LePRK2</u>
- **Gene Name:** receptor-like protein kinase2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Pollen Receptor Kinase **LePRK2** Mediates Growth-Promoting Signals and Positively Regulates Pollen Germination and Tube Growth.
   - Pollen with Reduced Expression of **LePRK2** Has a Lower Germination Percentage and a Shorter Germination Time Window.
   - A pollen receptor kinase from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), **LePRK2**, has been implicated in signaling during pollen germination and tube growth as well as in mediating pollen (tube)-pistil communication.
   - Pollen Tubes Transiently Overexpressing **LePRK2** Have Slightly Swollen Tips, But Pollen Tubes Coexpressing **LePRK2** and Full-Length KPP Have Much Wider Tips.
   - Together these results show that **LePRK2** positively regulates pollen germination and tube growth and is involved in transducing responses to extracellular growth-promoting signals.
