## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlMADS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** MADS-Box Transcription Factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A Tomato MADS-Box Transcription Factor, **SlMADS1**, Acts as a Negative Regulator of Fruit Ripening.
   - The real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that **SlMADS1** was highly expressed in sepals and fruits; its expression level was increased with the development of sepals, while the transcript of **SlMADS1** decreased significantly in accordance with fruit ripening.
   - **SlMADS1** RNAi fruits showed approximately 2- to 4-fold increases in ethylene production compared with the wild type.
   - **SlMADS1**-silenced seedlings displayed shorter hypocotyls and were more sensitive to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate than the wild type.
   - These results suggest that **SlMADS1** plays an important role in fruit ripening as a repressive modulator.
