## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SaWRKY1</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY transcription factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SaWRKY1** exhibited induced expression with significant modulation in xyloglucan endotrans hydrolase 5 (XTH5) and MYB2 expressions that correlated with the disease phenotypes.
   - WRKY1 overexpressing transgenic plants exhibited higher levels of EB resistance while RNAi silencing lines had increased susceptibility to A. solani with altered expression of XTH5 and MYB2.
   - WRKY1 acts as a key component improving resistance against Alternaria solani in wild tomato, Solanum arcanum Peralta.
   - These findings demonstrate the positive influence of WRKY1 in improving EB resistance in wild tomato and this could be further utilized as a potential target through genetic engineering to augment protection against A. solani in crop plants.
