## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc02g062460]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Sl23DOX</u>
- **Gene Name:** C-23 hydroxylase
- **Genome:** [Sol Genomics Network (http://solgenomics.net)]()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Some 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases were selected as candidates for the metabolic enzyme, and Solyc02g062460, designated **Sl23DOX**, was found to encode α-tomatine 23-hydroxylase.
   - Biochemical analysis of the recombinant **Sl23DOX** protein demonstrated that it catalyzes the 23-hydroxylation of α-tomatine and the product spontaneously isomerizes to neorickiioside B, which is an intermediate in α-tomatine metabolism that appears during ripening.
   - The ripe fruits of **Sl23DOX**-silenced transgenic tomato plants contained lower levels of esculeoside A but substantially accumulated α-tomatine.
   - The metabolic detoxification of α-tomatine during tomato fruit ripening is an important trait that aided in its domestication, and two distinct 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (DOXs), a C-23 hydroxylase of α-tomatine (**Sl23DOX**) and a C-27 hydroxylase of lycoperoside C (Sl27DOX), are key to this process.
   - **Sl23DOX** functions as α-tomatine 23-hydroxylase during the metabolic processing of toxic α-tomatine in tomato fruit ripening and is a key enzyme in the domestication of cultivated tomatoes.
