## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc07g008100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlKIX8</u>
- **Gene Name:** KINASE-INDUCIBLE DOMAIN INTERACTING 8
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SlKIX8** and SlKIX9 are negative regulators of leaf and fruit growth in tomato.
   - Loss-of-function of **SlKIX8** and SlKIX9 led to the production of enlarged, dome-shaped leaves and these leaves exhibited increased expression of putative Solanum lycopersicum PPD (SlPPD target genes. Unexpectedly, kix8 kix9 mutants carried enlarged fruits with increased pericarp thickness due to cell expansion.
   - Demonstrate that knocking out **SlKIX8** on its own or **SlKIX8** together with SlKIX9 results in the production of enlarged tomato fruits with increased pericarp thickness, suggesting that **SlKIX8** and/or SlKIX9 are involved in the regulation of tomato fruit growth.
   - Our results show that SIKIX8 and SIKIX9 are regulators of organ growth in asterids and can be used in strategies to improve important traits in produce such as thickness of the fruit flesh.
