## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc07g008630]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LeEIX2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) **LeEIX2** is an RLP that binds ethylene-inducing xylanase (EIX), a fungal elicitor.
   - Co-expression of SlRLK-like with **LeEIX2** led to a reduction in its abundance, apparently through an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation process. 
   - Report the identification of SlRLK-like, which contains a malectin-like domain, as a novel **LeEIX2** interactor and show that it acts as a negative regulator of defense responses mediated by the RLP **LeEIX2** by significantly reducing its abundance.
   - **LeEIX2** protein function, even prior to EIX perception, emphasizing the importance of tightly regulating a signaling pathway able to result in an HR and eventually cell death.
