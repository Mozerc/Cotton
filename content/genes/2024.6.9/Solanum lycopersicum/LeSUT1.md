## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LeSUT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose transport protein 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Sucrose transporter **LeSUT1** and LeSUT2 inhibition affects tomato fruit development in different ways.
   - Expression of **LeSUT1** and LeSUT2 was inhibited independently in transgenic tomato plants, using the antisense technique, in order to analyse their specific functions.
   - Although the phloem-specific inhibition of **LeSUT1** antisense plants showed a phenotype consistent with an essential role in phloem loading, constitutive LeSUT2 antisense inhibition exclusively affected tomato fruit and seed development.
   - While phloem loading was blocked in **LeSUT1** antisense plants, the fertility of fruits was reduced in LeSUT2 antisense plants.
