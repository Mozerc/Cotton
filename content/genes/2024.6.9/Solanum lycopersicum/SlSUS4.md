## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlSUS4</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose synthase isoform 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Comparison of a novel tomato sucrose synthase, **SlSUS4**, with previously described SlSUS isoforms reveals distinct sequence features and differential expression patterns in association with stem maturation.
   - we report the isolation of a novel tomato SUS (SlSUS) isoform, **SlSUS4**, that is homologous to potato SUS isoform 1 (StSUS1) and also shows greater homology to SUS isoforms of other plants than to the other tomato SUS isoforms.
   - SlSUS1 and **SlSUS4** display reversed expression patterns in developing tomato stem.
   - **SlSUS4** is more similar to specific SUS isoforms found in many other plants, including Arabidopsis, alfalfa and even pine, and relatively less similar to the other two SlSUS isoforms.
