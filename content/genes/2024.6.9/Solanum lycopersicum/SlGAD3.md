## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tomato Glutamate Decarboxylase Genes SlGAD2 and **SlGAD3** Play Key Roles in Regulating γ-Aminobutyric Acid Levels in Tomato.
   - We previously identified three tomato genes (SlGAD1, SlGAD2 and **SlGAD3**) encoding glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), likely the key enzyme for GABA biosynthesis in tomato fruits.
   - A significant decrease in GABA levels, i.e. 50–81% compared with wild-type (WT) levels, was observed in mature green (MG) fruits of the SlGAD2-suppressed lines, while a more drastic reduction (up to <10% of WT levels) was observed in the **SlGAD3**- and triple SlGAD-suppressed lines.
   - These findings suggest that both SlGAD2 and **SlGAD3** expression are crucial for GABA biosynthesis in tomato fruits.
   - We also determined that strong down-regulation of the SlGADs had little effect on overall plant growth, fruit development or primary fruit metabolism under normal growth conditions.
