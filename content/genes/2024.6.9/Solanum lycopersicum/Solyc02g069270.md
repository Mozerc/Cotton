## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc02g069270]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>AGO2b</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - AGO2a but not **AGO2b** mediates antiviral defense against infection of wild-type cucumber mosaic virus in tomato.
   - AGO2a nor **AGO2b** regulated disease induction after infection with either virus. Our findings firstly reveal a prominent role of AGO2a in antiviral RNAi innate immunity in tomato and demonstrate that antiviral RNAi evolves to defend against infection of natural wild-type CMV-Fny in tomato.
   - **AGO2b** should be a pseudogene without function due to the diminished expression level of **AGO2b** in tomato.
   - We found that AGO2a but not **AGO2b** was significantly induced to inhibit the propagation of not only VSR-deficient Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) but also wild-type CMV-Fny in tomato| however, neither AGO2a nor **AGO2b** regulated disease induction after infection with either virus.
