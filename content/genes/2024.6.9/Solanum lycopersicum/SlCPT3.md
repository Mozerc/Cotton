## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlCPT3</u>
- **Gene Name:** cis-prenyltransferase 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - RNAi-mediated suppression of one member of the tomato CPT family (**SlCPT3**) resulted in a ~60% decrease in dolichol content.
   - Co-expression of **SlCPT3** and SlCPTBP in yeast and in E. coli confirmed that dolichol synthase activity strictly requires both proteins.
   - Organelle isolation and in vivo localization of fluorescent protein fusions showed that both **SlCPT3** and SlCPTBP localize to the ER, the site of dolichol accumulation and synthesis in eukaryotes.
   - **SlCPT3**, interacts with the tomato LEW1 ortholog. Both of these proteins were required to fully compliment the yeast rer2âˆ† mutant, restore microsomal CPT activity, and dolichol synthesis.
