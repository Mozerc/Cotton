## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc11g030600]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlMET1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Methyltransferase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In leaf tissues, mutations in **SlMET1** caused CG hypomethylation and CHH hypermethylation on a whole-genome scale, leading to a disturbed transcriptome including ectopic expression of many RIN target genes such as ACC2 in leaf tissues, which are normally expressed in fruits.
   - Report the critical function of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Methyltransferase 1 (**SlMET1**) in plant development and DNA methylome and transcriptome regulation.
   - **SlMET1** is required for proper transcriptional regulation of key genes for tomato productivity.
   - Our results depict **SlMET1**- and tissue culture-dependent tomato DNA methylomes, and that **SlMET1** is required for maintaining a normal transcriptome and normal development of tomato.
