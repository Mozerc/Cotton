## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlALMT4</u>
- **Gene Name:** aluminum-activated malate transporter 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two Members of the Aluminum-Activated Malate Transporter Family, **SlALMT4** and SlALMT5, are Expressed during Fruit Development, and the Overexpression of SlALMT5 Alters Organic Acid Contents in Seeds in Tomato.
   - **SlALMT4** also transported malate, but the results were less consistent perhaps because it did not localize strongly to the plasma membrane.
   - Electrophysiological analysis of **SlALMT4** and SlALMT5 in Xenopus oocytes indicated that both the proteins transport malate.
   - **SlALMT4** localized to the ER and SlALMT5 localized to the ER and other endomembranes.
