## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlERF36</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The tomato EAR-motif repressor, **SlERF36**, accelerates growth transitions and reduces plant life cycle by regulating GA levels and responses.
   - An EAR-motif repressor, **SlERF36** that regulates various growth transitions, partly through regulation of the GA pathway and GA levels, was identified in tomato.
   - **SlERF36** is conserved across families making it an important candidate in agricultural and horticultural crops for manipulation of plant growth and developmental transitions to reduce life cycles for faster harvest.
   - **SlERF36** is an EAR-motif repressor and its levels regulate germination and organ expansion during juvenile/adult vegetative growth.
