## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Mp2g13330]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MpTGA</u>
- **Gene Name:** TGACG-motif-binding (TGA) transcription factor
- **Genome:** [MpTak_v6.1(https://marchantia.info/)]()
- **Species:** *Marchantia polymorpha*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MpTGA**, together with MpNPR, regulates sexual reproduction and independently affects oil body formation in Marchantia polymorpha.
   - **MpTGA** acts independently of MpNPR as a repressor of oil body (OB) formation and can thereby affect herbivory.
   - Common activities of **MpTGA**/MpNPR in sexual development suggest that coregulatory interactions were established after emergence of land-plant-specific NPR genes and contributed to the diversification of TGA TF functions during land-plant evolution.
