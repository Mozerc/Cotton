## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [CsaV3_2G005360]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsLOX08</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumber sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Based on the genome variation of **CsLOX08**, we developed an InDel marker. Genotyping of InDel markers was consistent with the content of (E,Z)-2,6-nonadien-1-ol in RILs, which were also verified in nine cucumber inbred lines.
   - An InDel marker was developed based on the genome variation of **CsLOX08**, and the InDel marker could genotype the high and low (E,Z)-2,6-nonadien-1-ol content individuals in cucumber fruits, which will provide cucumber breeders with some basis for molecular breeding.
   - The amino acid variation of **CsLOX08** protein in Q24 may lead to a change in lipoxygenase enzyme activity.
