## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>AgMaT2</u>
- **Gene Name:** mannitol transporter 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Apium graveolens*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of **AgMaT2**, a Plasma Membrane Mannitol Transporter from Celery, Expressed in Phloem Cells, Including Phloem Parenchyma Cells.
   - Data indicated that **AgMaT2** works as an H+/mannitol cotransporter with a weak selectivity toward other polyol molecules.
   - **AgMaT2** decreased the sensitivity to the mannitol-secreting pathogenic fungi Alternaria longipes, suggesting a role for polyol transporters in defense mechanisms.
   - In the phloem of petioles and leaflets, **AgMaT2**, as localized with specific antibodies, was present in the plasma membrane of three ontologically related cell types: sieve elements, companion cells, and phloem parenchyma cells.
   - These new data are discussed in relation to the physiological role of **AgMaT2** in regulating mannitol fluxes in celery petioles.
