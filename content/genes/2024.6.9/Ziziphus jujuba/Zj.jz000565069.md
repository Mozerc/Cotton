## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zj.jz000565069]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZjALMT4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Aluminum-Dependent Malate Transporter 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Ziziphus jujuba*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that the expression level of Aluminum-Dependent Malate Transporter 4 (**ZjALMT4**) was substantially higher in sour jujube than in jujube. Correlation analysis of mRNA abundance and fruit malate content and transient gene overexpression showed that **ZjALMT4** participates in malate accumulation.
   - Further sequencing analyses revealed that three genotypes of the W-box in the promoter of **ZjALMT4** in sour jujube associated with malate content were detected, and the genotype associated with low malate content was fixed in jujube.
   - These findings provide insights into the mechanism by which **ZjALMT4** modulates malate accumulation in sour jujube and jujube.
