## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaFAD2</u>
- **Gene Name:** fatty acid desaturase2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Crambe abyssinica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The individual effect of each **CaFAD2** gene on oil composition was investigated through studying transgenic lines (**CaFAD2**-RNAi) for differential expression levels in relation to the composition of seed-oil.
   - The silencing effect in these T1-plants ranged from the moderate silencing (40% to 50% reduction) of all three **CaFAD2** genes to strong silencing (95% reduction) of **CaFAD2**-C3 alone.
   - A significant reduction in expression level (P<0.01) in both families was only observed for **CaFAD2**-C3 together with significantly different C18:1 and PUFA levels in oil.
   - **CaFAD2**-C3 expression is highly correlated to levels of C18:1 (r=-0.78) and PUFA (r=0.75), which suggests that **CaFAD2**-C3 is the most important one for changing the oil composition of crambe.
