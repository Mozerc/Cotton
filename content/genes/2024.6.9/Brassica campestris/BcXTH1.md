## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BcXTH1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica campestris*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **BcXTH1**, a Brassica campestris homologue of Arabidopsis XTH9, is associated with cell expansion.
   - These results suggest that **BcXTH1** is the B. campestris homologue of XTH9. Expression analysis of **BcXTH1** revealed that it was expressed in most of the plant organs. In situ hybridization showed that the gene is highly expressed in the floral primodia, especially in the epidermal cell layer.
   - Southern blot analysis indicated that the **BcXTH1** gene exists as a multi-copy gene in the B. campestris genome. The function of the **BcXTH1** gene was deduced from using an overexpression strategy in Arabidopsis.
   - Immunoelectron microscopy shows that **BcXTH1** is localized almost exclusively to the cell wall, supporting our conclusion that it participates in the regulation of cell expansion in B. campestris.
