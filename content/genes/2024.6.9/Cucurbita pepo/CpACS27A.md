## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CpACS27A</u>
- **Gene Name:** Argo 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucurbita pepo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Molecular and functional characterization of **CpACS27A** gene reveals its involvement in monoecy instability and other associated traits in squash.
   - The molecular structure of **CpACS27A** and its specific expression in the carpels of female flowers during earlier stages of flower development suggests that this gene is the Cucurbita ortholog of CmACS7 and CsACS2. CpACS27B is likely to be a paralogous pseudogene since it has not been found to be expressed in any of the analyzed tissues.
   - In concordance with its involvement in stamen arrest, a reduction in **CpACS27A** expression has been found in bisexual flower buds at earlier stages of development. 
   - The role of **CpACS27A** is discussed regarding the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling genes in the control of andromonoecy-associated traits, such as the delayed maturation of corolla and stigma as well as the parthenocarpic development of the fruit.
