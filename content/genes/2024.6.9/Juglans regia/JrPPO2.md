## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>JrPPO2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Juglans regia*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **JrPPO2** was highly expressed in mature leaves and pistils.
   - The relative expression of JrPPO1 and **JrPPO2** in the explants cultured in different media exhibited opposite trends, and the trend of **JrPPO2** expression was similar to the trend of PPO activity, which suggests that **JrPPO2** plays an important role in the browning effect of phenolic compounds.
   - The results suggest that **JrPPO2** plays a key role in the oxidation of phenols in explants after branch injury.
   - JrPPO expression and phenolic content levels were determined in explants to elucidate the relationship between explant browning and JrPPOs and to provide new methods and theories for walnut tissue culture.
