## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhKNL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** KNOTTED1-LIKE
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton KNL1, encoding a class II KNOX transcription factor, is involved in regulation of fibre development.
   - **GhKNL1** was preferentially expressed in developing fibres at the stage of secondary cell wall (SCW) biosynthesis. **GhKNL1** was localized in the cell nucleus, and could interact with GhOFP4, as well as AtOFP1, AtOFP4, and AtMYB75.
   - Dominant repression of **GhKNL1** affected fibre development of cotton. The expression levels of genes related to fibre elongation and SCW biosynthesis were altered in transgenic fibres of cotton. As a result, transgenic cotton plants produced aberrant, shrunken, and collapsed fibre cells.
   - Complementation revealed that **GhKNL1** rescued the defective phenotype of Arabidopsis knat7 mutant in some extent. These data suggest that **GhKNL1**, as a transcription factor, participates in regulating fibre development of cotton.
   - Overexpression and dominant repression of **GhKNL1** in Arabidopsis resulted in a reduction in interfascicular fibre cell-wall thickening of basal stems of transgenic plants.
