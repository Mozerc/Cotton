## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhERF6</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene response factor 6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton Major Latex Protein 28 (GhMLP28) Functions as a Positive Regulator of the Ethylene Responsive Factor 6 (**GhERF6**) in Defense against Verticillium dahliae.
   - Further analysis revealed that GhMLP28 interacted with cotton ethylene response factor 6 (**GhERF6**) and facilitated the binding of **GhERF6** to GCC-box element. Transient expression assay demonstrated that GhMLP28 enhanced the transcription factor activity of **GhERF6**, which led to the augmented expression of some GCC-box genes.
   - **GhERF6** Binds to the GCC Box and Acts as a Transcription Factor,demonstrating that **GhERF6** could bind specifically to the GCC box in vitro.
   - These results demonstrate that GhMLP28 acts as a positive regulator of **GhERF6**, and synergetic actions of the two proteins may contribute substantially to protection against V. dahliae infection in cotton plants.
