## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhMYB25-like</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3-MYB transcription factor 25
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Among these transcription factors, previous studies showed that downregulation of **GhMYB25-like** leads to a fiberless phenotype in cotton seeds.
   - Molecular and genetic evidence showed that the GhJAZ2 protein suppresses fiber initiation in the overexpressing lines by interacting with **GhMYB25-like** and suppressing **GhMYB25-like** activity.
   - GhJAZ2 negatively regulated fiber initiation via interacting with **GhMYB25-like**.
   - **GhMYB25-like** has previously been shown to be an important factor for fiber cell differentiation and initiation in experiments, as silencing of this gene in transgenic cotton results in the production of fiberless seeds.
   - Transgenic cotton with an additional copy of the native gene had elevated expression of **GhMYB25-like** in ovules, but no obvious increase in fibre initials, suggesting that there may be other factors that interact with **GhMYB25-like** to differentiate epidermal cells into fibre cells.
