## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>WLIM1a</u>
- **Gene Name:** LIM domain protein LIM-2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Dual Functions of **WLIM1a** in Cell Elongation and Secondary Wall Formation in Developing Cotton Fibers.
   - Demonstrate dual roles of the **WLIM1a** gene in fiber development in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). **WLIM1a** is preferentially expressed during the elongation and secondary wall synthesis stages in developing fibers.
   - Overexpression of **WLIM1a** in cotton led to significant changes in fiber length and secondary wall structure. Compared with the wild type, fibers of **WLIM1a**-overexpressing plants grew longer and formed a thinner and more compact secondary cell wall, which contributed to improved fiber strength and fineness.
   -  Taken together, these results demonstrate that **WLIM1a** has dual roles in cotton fiber development, elongation, and secondary wall formation. Moreover, our study shows that lignin/lignin-like phenolics may substantially affect cotton fiber quality| this finding may guide cotton breeding for improved fiber traits.
