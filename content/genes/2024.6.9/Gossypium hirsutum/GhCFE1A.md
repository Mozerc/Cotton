## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhCFE1A</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhCFE1A**, a dynamic linker between the ER network and actin cytoskeleton, plays an important role in cotton fibre cell initiation and elongation.
   - The regulatory role of a novel protein **GhCFE1A** was uncovered. **GhCFE1A** is preferentially expressed at initiation and rapid elongation stages during fibre development| in addition, much higher expression of **GhCFE1A** was detected at the fibre initiation stage in Ô¨Åbreless cotton mutants than in the fibre-bearing TM-1 wild-type.
   - Overexpression of **GhCFE1A** in cotton not only delayed fibre cell elongation but also significantly reduced the density of lint and fuzz fibre initials and stem trichomes.
   - The results demonstrate that **GhCFE1A** probably functions as a dynamic linker between the actin cytoskeleton and the ER network, and plays an important role in fibre cell initiation and elongation during cotton fibre development.
