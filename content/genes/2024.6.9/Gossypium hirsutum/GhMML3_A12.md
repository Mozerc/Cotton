## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhMML3_A12</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYBMIXTA-like transcription factor 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Small interfering RNAs from bidirectional transcripts of **GhMML3_A12** regulate cotton fiber development.
   - Using a map-based cloning strategy for the first time in tetraploid cotton, we cloned a naked seed mutant gene (N1) encoding a MYBMIXTA-like transcription factor 3 (MML3)/GhMYB25-like in chromosome A12, **GhMML3_A12**, that is associated with fuzz fiber development.
   - Therefore, in a fiber-specific manner, small RNA derived from the **GhMML3_A12** locus can mediate **GhMML3_A12** mRNA self-cleavage and result in the production of naked seeds followed by lint fiber inhibition in N1 plants.
   - The siRNAs generated from **GhMML3_A12** may participate in posttranscription gene silencing of these GhMMLs and further inhibit lint fiber development in N1 plants, leading to extensive variations in lint performance.
