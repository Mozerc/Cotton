## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhAPX1</u>
- **Gene Name:** cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) cytosolic APX1 (**GhAPX1**) was identified to be highly accumulated during cotton fibre elongation by proteomic analysis.
   - Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses showed that **GhAPX1** was highly expressed in wild-type 5-d postanthesis fibres with much lower transcript levels in the fuzzless-lintless mutant ovules.
   - Treating in vitro cultured wild-type cotton ovules with exogenous H2O2 or ethylene induced the expression of **GhAPX1** and hence increased total APX activity proportionally, followed by extended fibre cell elongation.
   - These data suggest that **GhAPX1** expression is upregulated in response to an increase in cellular H2O2 and ethylene. **GhAPX1** encodes a functional enzyme that is involved in hydrogen peroxide homeostasis during cotton fibre development.
