## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhPFN1</u>
- **Gene Name:** profilin 1 gene
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional characterization of Gossypium hirsutum profilin 1 gene (**GhPFN1**) in tobacco suspension cells.
   - We previously cloned a cDNA encoding an isoform of cotton profilin and found that the gene (designated **GhPFN1**) was preferentially expressed in cotton fibers.
   - Overexpression of **GhPFN1** in the transgenic tobacco cells was correlated with the formation of elongated cells that contained thicker and longer microfilament cables.
   - Based on these data, we propose that **GhPFN1** may play a critical role in the rapid elongation of cotton fibers by promoting actin polymerization.
