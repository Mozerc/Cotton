## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton Major Latex Protein 28 (**GhMLP28**) Functions as a Positive Regulator of the Ethylene Responsive Factor 6 (GhERF6) in Defense against Verticillium dahliae.
   - Identified a defense-related major latex protein (MLP) from upland cotton (designated **GhMLP28**) and investigated its functional mechanism. **GhMLP28** transcripts were ubiquitously present in cotton plants, with higher accumulation in the root.
   - Expression of the **GhMLP28** gene was induced by Verticillium dahliae inoculation and was responsive to defense signaling molecules, including ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid.
   - Knockdown of **GhMLP28** expression by virus-induced gene silencing resulted in increased susceptibility of cotton plants to V. dahliae infection, while ectopic overexpression of **GhMLP28** in tobacco improved the disease tolerance of the transgenic plants.
   - These results demonstrate that **GhMLP28** acts as a positive regulator of GhERF6, and synergetic actions of the two proteins may contribute substantially to protection against V. dahliae infection in cotton plants.
