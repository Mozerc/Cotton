## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_D02G1817]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhERF9</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene response factor 9
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we have demonstrated that one of the ERF TFs in cotton, **GhERF9**, exerts a regulatory role in enhancing the expression of GhHAK5a by binding to its promoter region.
   - The yeast one-hybrid screening was performed to identify the transcription factors responsible for regulating GhHAK5a, and ethylene response factor 9 (**GhERF9**) was identified as a potential candidate.
   - Silencing of **GhERF9** decreased the expression of GhHAK5a and exacerbated K+ deficiency symptoms in leaves, also decreased K+ uptake rate and K+ content in roots.
   - Additionally, it was observed that the application of ethephon (an ethylene-releasing reagent) resulted in a significant upregulation of **GhERF9** and GhHAK5a, accompanied by an increased rate of K+ uptake. Expectedly, GhEIN3b and GhEIL3c, the two key components involved in ethylene signaling, bind directly to the **GhERF9** promoter.
