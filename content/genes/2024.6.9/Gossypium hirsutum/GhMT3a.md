## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhMT3a</u>
- **Gene Name:** Metallothionein-like
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton metallothionein **GhMT3a**, a reactive oxygen species scavenger, increased tolerance against abiotic stress in transgenic tobacco and yeast.
   - Northern blot analysis indicated that mRNA accumulation of **GhMT3a** was up-regulated not only by high salinity, drought, and low temperature stresses, but also by heavy metal ions, abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cotton seedlings.
   - Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants overexpressing **GhMT3a** showed increased tolerance against abiotic stresses compared with wild-type plants.
   - According to in vitro assay, recombinant **GhMT3a** protein showed an ability to bind metal ions and scavenge ROS. Transgenic yeast overexpressing **GhMT3a** also showed higher tolerance against ROS stresses.
   - These results indicated that **GhMT3a** could function as an effective ROS scavenger and its expression could be regulated by abiotic stresses through ROS signalling.
