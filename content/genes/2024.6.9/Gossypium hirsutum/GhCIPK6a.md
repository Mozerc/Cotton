## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhCIPK6a</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhCIPK6a** increases salt tolerance in transgenic upland cotton by involving in ROS scavenging and MAPK signaling pathways.
   - Overexpression of **GhCIPK6a** enhanced expression levels of co-expressed genes induced by salt stress, which scavenged ROS and involved in MAPK signaling pathways verified by RNA-seq analysis. 
   - Water absorption capacity and cell membrane stability of seeds from **GhCIPK6a** overexpressed lines was higher than that of wild-type seeds during imbibed germination stage.
   - The seed germination rates and seedling field emergence percentages of **GhCIPK6a** overexpressed lines were higher than that of control line under salt stress. Moreover, overexpressing of **GhCIPK6a** in cotton increased lint percentage, and fiber length uniformity under salt stress.
