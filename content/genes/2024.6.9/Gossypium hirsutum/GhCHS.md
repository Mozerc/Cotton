## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhCHS</u>
- **Gene Name:** chalcone synthase 1-like
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The three key genes of **GhCHS**, GhANR and GhLAR were predominantly expressed in the developing fibers of colored cotton.
   - The three genes of **GhCHS**, GhANR and GhLAR were predominantly expressed early in developing colored cotton fibers and identified to be a key genes of cotton fiber color formation.
   - It is very important to genetic manipulation **GhCHS**, GhANR and GhLAR in the anthocyanin metabolic pathway to improve the cotton fiber color, to satisfy the increasing great demand for green textile industry.
   - The three genes of **GhCHS**, GhANR and GhLAR played a crucial part in cotton fiber color formation and has important significant to improve natural colored cotton quality through genetic manipulation of the three genes and create new colored cotton germplasm resources by genetic engineering.
