## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhPK6</u>
- **Gene Name:** pyruvate kinase6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton cytosolic pyruvate kinase **GhPK6** participates in fast fiber elongation regulation in a ROS-mediated manner.
   - Cotton cytosolic pyruvate kinase **GhPK6** is preferentially expressed in the late stage of fiber elongation process, transgenic experiments indicated that its expression level was negatively correlated to cell expansion rate.
   - RT-qPCR and western blot analyses revealed that the expression of **GhPK6** was negatively correlated with fiber elongation rate, which well explains the observed sharp increase of cytosolic PK activity at the end of fast fiber elongation process.
   - These data collectively suggested that **GhPK6** might play an important role in regulating cotton fiber elongation in a ROS-dependent inhibition manner.
