## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_A09G0970.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhAAO2</u>
- **Gene Name:** abscisic acid aldehyde oxida 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhAAO2** was observed responding to NaHCO3 stress in cotton compared to AAO family genes.
   - After **GhAAO2** gene silencing, the degree of wilting of seedlings was lighter than that of the control group, indicating that **GhAAO2** could respond to NaHCO3 stress.
   - After silencing **GhAAO2** gene, the PRO content was significantly reduced. After NaHCO3 treatment, the PRO content of the pYL156 control group was increased, the content of PRO has reduced when treated with NaHCO3 after **GhAAO2** gene was silenced.
