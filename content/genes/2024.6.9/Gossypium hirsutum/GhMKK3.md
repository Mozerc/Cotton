## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Cotton Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase 3 (**GhMKK3**) Functions in Drought Tolerance by Regulating Stomatal Responses and Root Growth.
   - Overexpressing **GhMKK3** in Nicotiana benthamiana enhanced tolerance to drought, and the results of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays suggest that **GhMKK3** plays an important role in responses to abiotic stresses by regulating stomatal responses and root hair growth.
   - Further evidence demonstrated that overexpressing **GhMKK3** promoted root growth and ABA-induced stomatal closure.
   - More importantly, we identified an ABA- and drought-induced MAPK cascade that is composed of **GhMKK3**, GhMPK7 and GhPIP1 that compensates for deficiency in the MAPK cascade pathway in cotton under drought stress conditions.
