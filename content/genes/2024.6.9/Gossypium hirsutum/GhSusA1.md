## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhSusA1</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose synthase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **GhSusA1** increases plant biomass and improves cotton fiber yield and quality.
   - By association analysis, **GhSusA1** was highly correlated with fiber qualities in (7235Ã— TM-1) recombinant inbred lines based on polymorphism of **GhSusA1** between 7235 and TM-1.
   - Suppression of **GhSusA1** in transgenic cotton reduced fiber quality and decreased the boll size and seed weight. Importantly, overexpression of this gene increased fiber length and strength, with the latter indicated by the enhanced thickening of cell wall during secondary wall formation stage.
   - Increasing **GhSusA1** transcript abundance in vegetative tissues led to elevated seedling biomass.
   - Together, these findings identified **GhSusA1** as a key regulator of sink strength in cotton, which is tightly associated with productivity, and hence a promising candidate gene that can be developed to increase cotton fiber yield and quality.
