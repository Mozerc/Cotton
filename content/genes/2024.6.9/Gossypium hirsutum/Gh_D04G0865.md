## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_D04G0865]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhACT_LI1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A Gly65Val substitution in an actin, **GhACT_LI1**, disrupts cell polarity and F-actin organization resulting in dwarf, lintless cotton plants.
   - Identified the causative mutation of the dominant dwarf Ligon lintless Li1 short fiber mutant as a single Gly65Val amino acid substitution in a polymerization domain of an actin gene, **GhACT_LI1** (Gh_D04G0865).
   - This alteration disrupts the polymerization domain of **GhACT_LI1** and presents an excellent opportunity to study the specific role of this domain and this actin isoform in the development of polarized cells in plants.
   - We found that our VIGS construct efficiently reduced levels of the **GhACT_LI1** transcript and resulted in dwarf plants with crinkled leaves, with striking similarity to the Li1 phenotype.
