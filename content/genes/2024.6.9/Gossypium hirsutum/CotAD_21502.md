## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [CotAD_21502]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhMKK6</u>
- **Gene Name:** mitogen-activated protein kinase 6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Scaffold protein GhMORG1 enhances the resistance of cotton to Fusarium oxysporum by facilitating the **GhMKK6**-GhMPK4 cascade.
   - GhMORG1 interacted with **GhMKK6** and GhMPK4, and the overexpression of GhMORG1 in cotton protoplasts dramatically increased the activity of the **GhMKK6**-GhMPK4 cascade.
   - Identified as putative substrates of the GhMORG1-dependent **GhMKK6**-GhMPK4 cascade and participated in the resistance of cotton to F. oxysporum.
   - Ghr-miR5272a-mediated regulation of **GhMKK6** gene transcription contributes to the immune response in cotton.
   - These results indicated that GhMORG1 regulated the resistance of cotton to F. oxysporum by mediating the **GhMKK6**-GhMPK4 cascade.
   - These results suggest that GhMORG1 regulates several different disease resistance processes by facilitating the phosphorylation of **GhMKK6**-GhMPK4 cascade substrates. Taken together, these findings reveal a new plant MAPK scaffold protein and provide insights into the mechanism of plant resistance to pathogens.
