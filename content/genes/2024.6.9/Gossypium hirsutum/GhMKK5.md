## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhMKK5</u>
- **Gene Name:** mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase5
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cotton **GhMKK5** affects disease resistance, induces HR-like cell death, and reduces the tolerance to salt and drought stress in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana.
   - **GhMKK5**, from cotton belonging to the group C MAPKKs was isolated and characterized. The expression of **GhMKK5** can be induced by pathogen infection, abiotic stresses, and multiple defence-related signal molecules.
   - The overexpression of **GhMKK5** in Nicotiana benthamiana enhanced the plants’ resistance to the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum by elevating the expression of pathogen resistance (PR) genes, including PR1a, PR2, PR4, PR5, and NPR1, but increased the plants’ sensitivity to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae Tucker.
   - **GhMKK5**-overexpressing plants displayed markedly elevated expression of reactive oxygen species-related and cell death marker genes, such as NtRbohA and NtCDM, and resulted in hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death characterized by the accumulation of H2O2.
   - Drought obviously accelerated the cell death phenomenon in **GhMKK5**-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that **GhMKK5** may play an important role in pathogen infection and the regulation of the salt and drought stress responses in plants.
