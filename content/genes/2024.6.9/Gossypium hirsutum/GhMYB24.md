## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhMYB24</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3-MYB-like protein 24
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A Cotton Gene Encoding MYB-Like Transcription Factor (**GhMYB24**) is Specifically Expressed in Pollen and is Involved in Regulation of Late Anther/Pollen Development.
   - **GhMYB24** protein is localized in the cell nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator. Northern blot analysis revealed that **GhMYB24** transcripts were predominantly detected in anthers.
   - Overexpression of **GhMYB24** in Arabidopsis caused flower malformation, shorter filaments, non-dehiscent anthers and fewer viable pollen grains.
   - A complementation test demonstrated that **GhMYB24** was able to recover partially the male fertility of the myb21 myb24 double mutant.
   - Yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that **GhMYB24** interacted with GhJAZ1/2 in cells. Taking the data together, our results suggest that **GhMYB24** may play an important role in normal anther/pollen development.
