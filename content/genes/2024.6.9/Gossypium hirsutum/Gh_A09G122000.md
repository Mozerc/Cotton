## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_A09G122000]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhCaM7</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GhCaM7** is acetylated upon Verticillium dahliae (V. dahliae) infection and a positive regulator of V. dahliae resistance.
   - Overexpressing **GhCaM7** in cotton and Arabidopsis enhances V. dahliae resistance and knocking-down **GhCaM7** makes cotton more susceptible to V. dahliae.
   - **GhCaM7** and GhOSM34 are co-localized in the cell membrane.
   - Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing **GhCaM7** with mutation at the acetylation site are more susceptible to V. dahliae than transgenics overexpressing the wild-type **GhCaM7**, implying the importance of the acetylated **GhCaM7** in response to V. dahliae infection. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescent complementation, luciferase complementation imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated interaction between **GhCaM7** and an osmotin protein GhOSM34 that was shown to have a positive role in V. dahliae resistance.
   - Comparative transcriptomic analyses between cotton plants with an increased or reduced expression level of **GhCaM7** and wild-type plants indicate the involvement of jasmonic acid signaling pathways and reactive oxygen species in **GhCaM7**-enabled disease resistance.
