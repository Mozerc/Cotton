## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhACS2</u>
- **Gene Name:** ACS-like protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - To elucidate the roles of genes during anther development, two anther-specific cDNAs (designated GhACS1 and **GhACS2**) encoding acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs) were isolated from a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) flower cDNA library.
   - **GhACS2** is also specifically expressed in the anther. Its expression level, however, was about 100-fold lower than that of GhACS1.
   - Our data indicated that the GhACS1 expression was suppressed to very low levels in the male-sterile transgenic anthers examined but **GhACS2** expression remained unaltered in these plants.
   - The remaining ACS activity in transgenic lines can probably be attributed to other GhACSs (such as **GhACS2**) expressed in anther tissues or/and residual GhACS1.
