## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [CotAD_62126]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhGalT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** β-galactosyltransferase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A gene (**GhGalT1**) encoding a putative β-1,3-galactosyltransferase (GalT) was identified in cotton. **GhGalT1**, belonging to CAZy GT31 family, is the type II membrane protein that contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal galactosyltransferase functional domain. A subcellular localization assay demonstrated that **GhGalT1** was localized in the Golgi apparatus.
   - The cotton β-galactosyltransferase 1 (GalT1) that galactosylates arabinogalactan proteins participates in controlling fiber development.
   - Characterized the role of a CAZy glycosyltransferase 31 (GT31) family member, **GhGalT1**, in cotton fiber development. The fiber length of the transgenic cotton overexpressing **GhGalT1** was shorter than that of the wild type, whereas in the **GhGalT1**-silenced lines there was a notable increase in fiber length compared with wild type.
   - We also show that **GhGalT1** can form homo- and heterodimers with other cotton GT31 family members to facilitate AG glycan assembly of AGPs. Thus, our data demonstrate that **GhGalT1** influences cotton fiber development via controlling the glycosylation of AGPs, especially FLAs.
   - These data suggested that **GhGalT1** may be involved in regulation of pectin biosynthesis required for plant development.
