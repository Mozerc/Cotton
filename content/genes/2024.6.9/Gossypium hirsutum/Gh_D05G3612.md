## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_D05G3612]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhGLU19D</u>
- **Gene Name:** Glucanase 19
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Suppression of GhGLU19 encoding β-1,3-glucanase promotes seed germination in cotton.
   - GhGLU19 belongs to subfamily B and was expressed predominately in imbibed seeds and early seedlings. Compared to wild type, GhGLU19-suppressing and GhGLU19-overexpressing transgenic cotton lines showed the higher and lower seed germination percentage, respectively.
   - Callose was enriched more at inner integument (ii) than that in embryo and seed coat in cotton seeds. In GhGLU19-suppressing lines, callose at ii of cotton seeds was greatly increased and brought about a prolonged water uptake process during imbibition.
   - Both proteomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed that contrary to GhGLU19-overexpressing lines, the glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism was decreased, and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis related genes were downregulated in imbibed seeds of GhGLU19-suppressing lines.
   - Endogenous ABA was significantly decreased in GhGLU19-suppressing line while increased in GhGLU19-overexpressing line.
