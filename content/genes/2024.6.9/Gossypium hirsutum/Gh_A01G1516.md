## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_A01G1516]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhHAK5aA</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Cotton High-Affinity K+ Transporter, GhHAK5a, Is Essential for Shoot Regulation of K+ Uptake in Root under Potassium Deficiency.
   - GhHAK5a, an orthologous of Arabidopsis thaliana high-affinity K+ transporter, AtHAK5, was significantly induced in the CCRI41 rootstock by the SCRC22 scion.
   - Agrobacterium-mediated virus-induced gene silencing and yeast complementary assay showed that GhHAK5a is a high-affinity K+ uptake transporter.
   - Silencing of GhHAK5a in the CCRI41 rootstock almost completely inhibited the K+ uptake induced by SCRC22 scion in CCRI41 rootstock.
   - We identified a key high-affinity K+ transporter, GhHAK5a in cotton, which is the essential target for shoot regulation of root K+ uptake under K+ deficiency.
