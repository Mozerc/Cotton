## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhACS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ACS-like protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **GhACS1** gene encodes an acyl-CoA synthetase which is essential for normal microsporogenesis in early anther development of cottonã€‚
   - Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and northern blot analyses revealed that **GhACS1** transcripts were predominantly accumulated in the developing anthers of cotton. 
   - High levels of **GhACS1** activity are crucial for fatty acid metabolism in PSCs, PMCs, microspores and particularly tapetal cells. Reduction of ACS enzymatic activity by suppressing **GhACS1** expression severely affected the tapetal cells and consequently blocked normal microsporogenesis in early anther development.
   - As a result, the transgenic plants failed to produce functional pollen grains and were male-sterile, suggesting that the **GhACS1** gene is required for normal microsporogenesis in early anther development of cotton.
