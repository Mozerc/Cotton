## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhADF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** actin depolymerizing factor1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - characterized the function of a member of the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) family in Gossypium hirsutum by down-regulation of the gene (designated as **GhADF1**) expression in the transgenic cotton plants.
   - We observed that both the fibre length and strength of the **GhADF1**-underexpressing plants increased as compared to the wild-type fibre, and transgenic fibres contained more abundant F-actin filaments in the cortical region of the cells.
   - Inhibition of **GhADF1** expression affected the synthesis and deposition of the secondary cell wall cellulose.
   - Our results suggest that organization of actin cytoskeleton regulated by actin-associated proteins such as **GhADF1** plays a critical role in the processes of elongation and secondary cell wall formation during fibre development.
