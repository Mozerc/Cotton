## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ScRALF3</u>
- **Gene Name:** rapid alkalinization factor 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum chacoense*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ScRALF3**, a secreted RALF-like peptide involved in cell–cell communication between the sporophyte and the female gametophyte in a solanaceous species.
   - **ScRALF3** is an important peptide regulator of female gametophyte development. Its expression, which is auxin-inducible, is strictly regulated before and after fertilization. Down-regulation of **ScRALF3** expression by RNA interference leads to the production of smaller fruits that produce fewer seeds, due to improper development of the embryo sacs.
   - **ScRALF3** is expressed in the sporophytic tissue surrounding the embryo sac, the integument and the nucellus, as revealed by in situ hybridization and GUS staining.
   - As expected for a secreted peptide, fluorescence from an **ScRALF3**–GFP fusion construct is detected throughout the secretory pathway.
   - The **ScRALF3** secreted peptide may be directly involved in the regulation of multiple aspects of cell–cell communication between the female gametophyte and its surrounding sporophytic tissue during ovule development.
