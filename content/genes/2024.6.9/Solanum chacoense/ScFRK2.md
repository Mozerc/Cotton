## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ScFRK2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Fertilization-related kinase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum chacoense*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The **ScFRK2** MAP kinase kinase kinase from Solanum chacoense affects pollen development and viability.
   - We have previously described the FERTILIZATION-RELATED KINASE 2 (**ScFRK2**), a MAP kinase kinase kinase from Solanum chacoense that is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues.
   - Overexpression of the **ScFRK2** gene modifies the cell fate of ovule initials and induces homeotic transformation of ovules into carpelloid structures.
   - Overexpression of **ScFRK2** transcripts strongly disturbed pollen development. At maturity, almost two-thirds of pollen grains were severely affected and non-viable, while the remaining pollen grains were significantly smaller than wild type pollen.
   - Cross with pollen from a **ScFRK2** overexpression line into a wild type female plant produced an F1 population with 44% of the progeny having the transgene, suggesting that the pollen defect is caused by a sporophytic dysfunction, leading to major structural defects and incomplete pollen development.
