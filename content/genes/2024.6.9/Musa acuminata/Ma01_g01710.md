## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Ma01_g01710]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MaBEL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN transcription factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Musa acuminata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MaBEL1** regulates banana fruit ripening by activating cell wall and starch degradation-related genes.
   - BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN transcription factor 1 (**MaBEL1**) and its associated proteins regulate the fruit softening and ripening process.
   - The transcript and protein levels of **MaBEL1** were up-regulated with fruit ripening but severely repressed by the chilling stress.
   - The transient overexpression of **MaBEL1** alleviated fruit chilling injury and ripening disorder caused by cold stress and promoted fruit softening and ripening of “Fenjiao” banana by inducing ethylene production and starch and cell wall degradation.
   - Report a novel **MaBEL1**-MaEBF1-MaABI5-like complex system that mediates the fruit softening and ripening disorder in “Fenjiao” bananas caused by cold stress.
