## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Ma06_g34790]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MaMAPK3|MaMAPK3a</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [genome database of Musa (http://banana-genome-hub.southgreen.fr/home)]()
- **Species:** *Musa acuminata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MaMAPK3|MaMAPK3a**-MaICE1-MaPOD P7 pathway, a positive regulator of cold tolerance in banana.
   - RNAi of **MaMAPK3|MaMAPK3a** significantly changed the expressions of the cold-responsive genes, and the oxidoreductase activity was significantly changed in WT plants, while no changes in transgenic plants were observed.
   - **MaMAPK3|MaMAPK3a** participated in the regulation of cold resistance in ‘Dajiao’ that has a stronger cold tolerance than other banana cultivars.
   - Taken together, our work provided new and solid evidence that **MaMAPK3|MaMAPK3a**-MaICE1-MaPOD P7 pathway positively improved the cold tolerance in monocotyledon banana, shedding light on molecular breeding for the cold-tolerant banana or other agricultural species.
