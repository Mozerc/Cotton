## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Ma10_g12120]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MaNAC083</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Musa acuminata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - MaMADS1–**MaNAC083** transcriptional regulatory cascade regulates ethylene biosynthesis during banana fruit ripening.
   - NAC (NAM, ATAF, CUC) transcription factor, **MaNAC083**, a ripening and ethylene-inhibited gene, was discovered as a potential binding protein to the MaACS1 promoter by yeast one-hybrid screening.
   - Further in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that **MaNAC083** bound directly to promoters of the five ethylene biosynthesis genes, thereby transcriptionally repressing their expression, which was further verified by transient overexpression experiments, where ethylene production was inhibited through **MaNAC083**-modulated transcriptional repression of ethylene biosynthesis genes in banana fruits.
   - These findings collectively illustrated the mechanistic basis of a MaMADS1–**MaNAC083**–MaACS1/MaACOs regulatory cascade controlling ethylene biosynthesis during banana fruit ripening.
