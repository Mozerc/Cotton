## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Ma06_g11140]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MaMYB3</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3-MYB transcription factor 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Musa acuminata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A banana R2R3-MYB transcription factor **MaMYB3** is involved in fruit ripening through modulation of starch degradation by repressing starch degradation-related genes and MabHLH6.
   - Identified a MYB transcription factor (TF) termed **MaMYB3**, as a putative protein binding the promoter of MaGWD1, a member of glucan water dikinase (GWD) family which has been demonstrated as an important enzyme of starch degradation.
   - **MaMYB3** was ripening- and ethylene-repressible, and its expression was negatively correlated with starch degradation. 
   - The ectopic overexpression of **MaMYB3** in tomato down-regulated the expression of starch degradation-related genes, inhibited starch degradation and delayed fruit ripening.
   - We conclude that **MaMYB3** negatively impacts starch degradation by directly repressing starch degradation-related genes and MabHLH6, and thereby delays banana fruit ripening.
