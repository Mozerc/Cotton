## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MuMADS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** MADS-box protein MADS1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Musa acuminata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Banana Ovate Family Protein MaOFP1 and MADS-Box Protein **MuMADS1** Antagonistically Regulated Banana Fruit Ripening.
   - **MuMADS1** and MaOFP1 expression in postharvest ripening stages following different treatments was antagonistically regulated at the transcriptional level by ethylene and 1-MCP.
   - These results indicate that **MuMADS1** and MaOFP1 are antagonistically regulated by ethylene and might play important roles in postharvest banana fruit ripening.
   - Antagonistic regulation of **MuMADS1** and MaOFP1 following ethylene and 1-MCP treatment.
   - **MuMADS1** and MaOFP1 regulate fruit quality in a tomato ovate mutant.
