## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Potri.009G042600.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PtrDIV4</u>
- **Gene Name:** PtrDIV4
- **Genome:** [Phytozome: Populus trichocarpa v3.0]()
- **Species:** *Populus trichocarpa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In addition to interacting with poplar homologs of RADIALIS (PtrRAD1) and DIVARICATA (**PtrDIV4**), PtrDRIF1 interacted with members of other families within the homeodomain-like superfamily, including PtrWOX13c, a WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX protein, and PtrKNAT7, a KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX protein.
   - PtrRAD1 and **PtrDIV4** interacted with the MYB/SANT-containing N-terminal portion of PtrDRIF1, whereas DUF3755 was both necessary and sufficient for interactions with PtrWOX13c and PtrKNAT7.
   - It was shown that DUF3755 was sufficient for interactions with PtrWOX13c and PtrKNAT7, and that these HD proteins did not interact with the MYB/SANT-containing N-terminal 100-amino-acid portion of PtrDRIF1 that was, on the other hand, sufficient for interactions with PtrRAD1 and **PtrDIV4**.
