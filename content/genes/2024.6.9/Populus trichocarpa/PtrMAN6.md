## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PtrMAN6</u>
- **Gene Name:** Populus endo-1,4-β-mannanase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Populus trichocarpa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Populus endo-beta-mannanase **PtrMAN6** plays a role in coordinating cell wall remodeling with suppression of secondary wall thickening through generation of oligosaccharide signals.
   - **PtrMAN6** is expressed specifically in xylem tissue and its encoded protein localizes to developing vessel cells.
   - Overexpression of **PtrMAN6** enhanced wall loosening as well as suppressed secondary wall thickening, whilst knockdown of its expression promoted secondary wall thickening.
   - Application of the oligosaccharides resulted in cellular and transcriptional changes that were similar to those found in **PtrMAN6** overexpressed transgenic plants.
   - Overall, our results demonstrated that **PtrMAN6** plays a role in hydrolysis of mannan-type wall polysaccharides to produce oligosaccharides that may serve as signaling molecules to suppress cell wall thickening during wood xylem cell differentiation.
