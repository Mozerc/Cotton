## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Potri.002G105600]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PtDAM1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [PopGenIE database:(https://popgenie.org/).]()
- **Species:** *Populus trichocarpa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PtDAM1** induction in buds was weaker in the first half of the treatment in ‘Walker’ (1.1–1.6-fold induction) which did not enter endodormancy.
   - **PtDAM1** was not expressed in the leaves of either cultivar while leaf CBFs expression pattern was several fold higher in ‘Walker’, peaking at day 1. Leaf phytohormones in both cultivars followed similar profiles during growth cessation but differentiated based on cytokinins which were largely reduced, while the Ox-IAA and iP7G increased in ‘Okanese’ compared to ‘Walker’. 
   - These findings support the possible relationship between PtCBF1, **PtDAM1** induction and endodormancy development.
   - In this study, the differences between the early induction of growth cessation and the depth of endodormancy between two tested poplar cultivars under short photoperiod and low night temperature treatment are associated with the differential expression levels of CBF1 and **PtDAM1** genes in buds as well as degradation of growth-promoting phytohormones auxin and cytokinins in leaves.
