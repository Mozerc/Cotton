## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CpPI</u>
- **Gene Name:** B-class MADS-box protein PI
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Carica papaya*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CpPI** is the ortholog of the Arabidopsis gene PI, the CpTM6-1 and CpTM6-2 loci are representatives of the paralogous TM6 lineage that contain paleoAP3 motifs unlike the euAP3 gene observed in Arabidopsis. 
   - **CpPI** was expressed in petals and stamens of hermaphrodite flowers, in petals of female flowers, and petals and stamens of male flowers.
   - **CpPI** is grouped together with GGLO1 (Gerbera) and Ri.sa.PI (Ribes) in the MP analysis (not shown) and is sister to a clade of Cucumis, Ribes, Gerbera, Petunia, Nicotiana, Antirrhinum, and Syringa in the ML analysis, but the supporting values of these relationships in both analyses were less than 50%.
   - Our results showed that B-class gene homologs could function as predicted by the ABC model in trioecous flowers but differential expressions of CpTM6-1, and CpTM6-2, and **CpPI** suggested the diversification of their functions after the duplication events.
