## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsHDA2</u>
- **Gene Name:** histone deacetylase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Involvement of histone deacetylase **CsHDA2** in regulating (E)-nerolidol formation in tea  exposed to tea green leafhopper infestation.
   - A tea green leafhopper infestation inhibited **CsHDA2** expression and decreased **CsHDA2** abundance.
   - The results of this study clarify the effect of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs and identified **CsHDA2**–CsMYC2 as an important transcriptional regulatory module for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by a tea green leafhopper infestation.
   - In this study, we revealed the effects of histone acetylations on the accumulation of HIPVs, while also confirming that **CsHDA2**–CsMYC2 is an important transcriptional regulatory module for the accumulation of (E)-nerolidol induced by tea green leafhoppers.
