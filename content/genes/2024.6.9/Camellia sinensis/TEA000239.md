## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TEA000239]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsUGT84J2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Al-induced glycosyltransferase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Found that flavonol glycoside levels in tea roots increased following Al treatment, and the Al-induced UDP glycosyltransferase **CsUGT84J2** was involved in this mechanism.
   - Furthermore, metabolic analysis with UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS revealed significantly increased flavonol and auxin glycoside accumulation in **CsUGT84J2**-overexpressing Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, the expression of genes involved in the flavonol pathway as well as in the auxin metabolism, transport, and signaling pathways was remarkably enhanced.
   - Additionally, lateral root growth and exogenous Al stress tolerance were significantly improved in transgenic A. thaliana. Moreover, gene expression and metabolic accumulation related to phenolic acids, flavonols, and auxin were upregulated in **CsUGT84J2**-overexpressing tea plants but downregulated in **CsUGT84J2**-silenced tea plants.
   - Al treatment induced **CsUGT84J2** expression, mediated flavonol and auxin glycosylation, and regulated endogenous auxin homeostasis in tea roots, thereby promoting the growth of tea plants. Our findings lay the foundation for studying the precise mechanisms through which Al promotes the growth of tea plants.
