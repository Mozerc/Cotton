## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsGGT2</u>
- **Gene Name:** γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - γ-Glutamyl-transpeptidase **CsGGT2** functions as light-activated theanine hydrolase in tea plant.
   - Demonstrated that the expression patterns of **CsGGT2** (γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase), participated in theanine synthesis in vitro in our previous research, are significantly different in the aboveground and underground tissues of tea plants and regulated by light. 
   - Light up-regulated the expression of CsHY5, directly binding to the promoter of **CsGGT2** and acting as an activator of **CsGGT2**, with a negative correlation with theanine accumulation. 
   - Therefore, light mediates the degradation of theanine in different tissues by regulating the expression of the theanine hydrolase **CsGGT2** in tea plants, and these results provide new insights into the degradation of theanine mediated by light in tea plants.
