## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PpEBB</u>
- **Gene Name:** EARLY BUD-BREAK
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Populus tremula x Populus alba*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Involvement of EARLY BUD-BREAK(**PpEBB**), an AP2/ERF Transcription Factor Gene, in Bud Break in Japanese Pear (Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai) Lateral Flower Buds: Expression, Histone Modifications and Possible Target Genes.
   - We provide evidence that **PpEBB** may interact with and regulate pear four D-type cyclin (PpCYCD3) genes during bud break in ‘Kosui’ lateral flower buds.
   - The transcriptional regulation of **PpEBB** was also studied in lateral flower buds treated with hydrogen cyanamide (HC), which is able to cause early bud break in the Japanese pear.
   - We examined the following two hypotheses: (i) H3K4me3 (active histone mark) and H3K27me3, (inactive histone mark) may be involved in transcription regulation of **PpEBB**, and (ii) CYCD genes may be possible targets of **PpEBB**.
