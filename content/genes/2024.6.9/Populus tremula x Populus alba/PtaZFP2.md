## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PtaZFP2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Cys2/His2 zinc finger protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Populus tremula x Populus alba*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A single bending modified plant diameter growth and increased the relative abundance of **PtaZFP2** transcripts. Integrals of longitudinal strains induced by bending on the responding tissues were highly correlated to local plant responses.
   - Time course analysis of expression demonstrated that **PtaZFP2** mRNA accumulated as early as 5 min in response to a controlled stem bending and is restricted to the organ where the mechanical stimulus is applied.
   - The real-time quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction experiments showed that **PtaZFP2** was also rapidly up-regulated in poplar stems in response to gravitropism suggesting that **PtaZFP2** is induced by different mechanical signals.
   - Abundance of **PtaZFP2** transcripts also increased highly in response to wounding and to a weaker extent to salt treatment and cold, which is consistent with the numerous putative cis-elements found in its regulatory region.
