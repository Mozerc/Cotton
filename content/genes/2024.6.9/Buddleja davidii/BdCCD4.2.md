## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BdCCD4.2</u>
- **Gene Name:** carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Buddleja davidii*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Both BdCCD4 genes are highly expressed during flower development and transcripts levels parallel the accumulation of crocins in the petals.
   - Phylogenetic analysis showed that **BdCCD4.2** grouped with almost all the characterized CCD4 enzymes, while BdCCD4.1 and BdCCD4.3 form a new sub-cluster together with CCD4 enzymes from certain Lamiales species.
   - The expression of BdCCD1 and **BdCCD4.2** remained at relatively low levels during flower development and metabolites of crocins increased.
   - **BdCCD4.2** belongs to the CCD4 subfamily from dicotyledonous plants.
