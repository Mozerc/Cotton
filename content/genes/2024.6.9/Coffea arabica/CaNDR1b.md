## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaNDR1b</u>
- **Gene Name:** Non-race specific Disease Resistance 1b
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Coffea arabica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identification and characterization of the Non-race specific Disease Resistance 1 (NDR1) orthologous protein in coffee.
   - We have isolated and characterized the coffee NDR1 gene, whose Arabidopsis ortholog is a well-known master regulator of the hypersensitive response that is dependent on coiled-coil type R-proteins.
   - CaNDR1 gene(s) might be target(s) of choice for manipulating the coffee innate immune system and achieving broad spectrum resistance to pathogens.
   - Given the potential conservation of NDR1-dependent defense mechanisms between Arabidopsis and coffee plants, our work also suggests new ways to isolate the as-yet-unidentified R-gene(s) responsible for resistance to H. vastatrix.
