## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvPHT1|6</u>
- **Gene Name:** phosphate transporter1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Horedum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - we expressed **HvPHT1|6**|**HvPHT1|6** in Xenopus laevis oocytes, allowing detailed characterization of voltage-dependent fluxes and currents induced by **HvPHT1|6**|**HvPHT1|6**. **HvPHT1|6**|**HvPHT1|6** increased efflux of Pi near oocyte resting membrane potentials, dependent on external Pi concentration.
   - Our results demonstrate that **HvPHT1|6**|**HvPHT1|6** is most likely to be a proton-coupled Pi transporter, though it has time-dependent activation at negative membrane potentials with linear concentration dependence similar to voltage-dependent ion channels.
   - The electrophysiological properties of **HvPHT1|6**|**HvPHT1|6**, which locates to the plasma membrane when expressed in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells, are consistent with its suggested role in the remobilization of Pi in barley plants.
   - The Pi transporter **HvPHT1|6**|**HvPHT1|6** is highly expressed in old leaves compared to young leaves, and its transcript is abundant in phloem tissue, with a lower level also observed in mesophyll cells. These data suggest that **HvPHT1|6**|**HvPHT1|6** plays a major role in Pi remobilization.
