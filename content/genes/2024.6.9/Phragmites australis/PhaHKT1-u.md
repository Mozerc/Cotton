## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhaHKT1-u</u>
- **Gene Name:** high-affinity K+ transporter1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Phragmites australis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cloning and functional comparison of a high-affinity K+ transporter gene PhaHKT1 of salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive reed plants.
   - To understand the mechanisms of ion homeostasis in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive plants, cDNAs for a high-affinity K+ transporter PhaHKT1 were isolated from salt-sensitive (Utsunomiya) and salt-tolerant (Nanpi, Enchi) reed plants.
   - Expression of PhaHKT1 mRNA was detected in the roots of Nanpi and Enchi plants under K+ starvation conditions and also under Na+ treatment conditions, whereas it was only slightly detected in the roots of Utsunomiya plants under each of these conditions.
   - These results suggest that PhaHKT1 plays an important role in the acquisition of K+ and maintenance of ion balance under saline conditions.
