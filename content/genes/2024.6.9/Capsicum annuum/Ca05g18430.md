## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Ca05g18430]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaMYB12-like</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CaMYB12-like** underlies a major QTL for flavonoid content in pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruit.
   - Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of **CaMYB12-like** led to a significant decrease in the expression of several flavonoid pathway genes and a drastic decrease in flavonoid levels in silenced fruits.
   - Expression of **CaMYB12-like** in the tomato slmyb12 mutant led to enhanced levels of several flavonoids in the fruit skin.
   - A combination of metabolomic, genetic and gene functional analyses led to discovery of **CaMYB12-like** as a major regulator of flavonoid variation in pepper fruit and demonstrated its potential to breed for high-flavonoid content in cultivated pepper.
