## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaJOINTLESS</u>
- **Gene Name:** Cajointless
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CaJOINTLESS** is a MADS-box gene involved in suppression of vegetative growth in all shoot meristems in pepper.
   - While **CaJOINTLESS** and JOINTLESS have partially conserved functions, the effect on flowering time and on sympodial development in pepper, as well as the epistasis over FASCICULATE, the homologue of the major determinant of sympodial development SELF-PRUNING, is stronger than in tomato. Furthermore, the solitary terminal flower of pepper is converted into a structure composed of flowers and leaves in the mutant lines.
   - Late flowering of the primary and sympodial shoots of **CaJOINTLESS** indicates that the gene functions as a suppressor of vegetative growth in all shoot meristems.
   - This conversion supports the hypothesis that the solitary flowers of pepper have a cryptic inflorescence identity that is suppressed by **CaJOINTLESS**. Formation of solitary flowers in wild-type pepper is suggested to result from precocious maturation of the inflorescence meristem.
