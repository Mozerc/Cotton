## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Capana02g000700]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaERF28</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene-responsive factor 28
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A single transcript CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutagenesis of **CaERF28** confers anthracnose resistance in chilli pepper.
   - T-DNA-free homozygous mutant lines developed through a single transcript CRISPR/Cas9 system harboring the desired modification in the **CaERF28** locus exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to the anthracnose pathogen Colletotrichum truncatum coupled with the improved expression of defense responsive genes.
   - The silencing of **CaERF28** in pepper fruit using a virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) system demonstrated a significant reduction in transcript levels coupled with substantial repression of fungal load and no disease symptoms post infection with C. truncatum
   - Our results demonstrated that the STU-CRISPR/Cas9 mediated editing of the **CaERF28** gene is a rapid, safe and versatile approach for enhancing anthracnose resistance in chilli pepper and pave way for its utilization in the improvement of other solanaceous crops.
