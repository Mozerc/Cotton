## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Ca12g04370]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaAIL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** AP2 transcription factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CaAIL1** Acts Positively in Pepper Immunity against Ralstonia solanacearum by Repressing Negative Regulators.
   - Discovered that the AP2 transcription factor **CaAIL1** functions in immunity against Ralstonia solanacearum infection (RSI) in pepper (Capsicum annuum).
   - **CaAIL1** expression was upregulated by RSI, and loss- and gain-of-function assays using virus-induced gene silencing and transient overexpression, respectively, revealed that **CaAIL1** plays a positive role in immunity to RSI in pepper.
   - These findings indicate that **CaAIL1** enhances the immunity of pepper against RSI by repressing a subset of negative immune regulators during the RSI response through its binding to several cis-elements in their promoters.
