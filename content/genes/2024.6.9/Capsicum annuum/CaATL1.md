## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaATL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** AT-hook-Like gene 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The chili pepper **CaATL1**: an AT-hook motif-containing transcription factor implicated in defence responses against pathogens.
   - Expression of **CaATL1** was specifically induced in host- and non-host-resistant responses against bacterial and viral pathogens in pepper plants.
   - **CaATL1** transcripts also increased following salicylic acid and ethephone treatment but were only mildly induced by methyl-jasmonate treatment. **CaATL1**::smGFP (soluble-modified green fluorescent protein) fusion protein localized to nuclei in tobacco BY2 protoplasts.
   - The C-terminal region of the **CaATL1** protein fused to the LexA DNA binding domain was able to activate reporter gene expression in yeast. To analyse further the role of the **CaATL1** in pathogen defence response, we generated **CaATL1**-over-expressing transgenic tomato plants.
