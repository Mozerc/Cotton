## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaHsfA2</u>
- **Gene Name:** heat stress transcription factor A2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CaHsfA2** was located in the nucleus and had transcriptional activity, consistent with the typical features of Hsfs. Time-course expression profiling of **CaHsfA2** in response to heat stress revealed differences in its expression level and pattern between the pepper thermosensitive line B6 and thermotolerant line R9.
   - In contrast, the fluorescence of the 35S::**CaHsfA2**-GFP chimera was associated with the cellular nucleus in onion epidermal cells, suggesting a nuclear localization of **CaHsfA2**.
   - **CaHsfA2** discriminatively responds to HS in two pepper lines differing in thermotolerance.
   - **CaHsfA2** might be a rhythmic gene, like Arabidopsis HsfB2b, which is regulated by both HS and the circadian clock, while the regulatory mechanism of **CaHsfA2** responding to HS needs to be explored further.
