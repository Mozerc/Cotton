## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaAIPP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** protein phosphatase 2C 37
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Capsicum annuum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional analysis of the pepper protein phosphatase, **CaAIPP1**, and its interacting partner CaAIRF1: Modulation of ABA signalling and the drought stress response.
   - **CaAIPP1** gene expression in pepper leaves was induced by ABA and drought. **CaAIPP1** degradation was faster in crude protein extracts from ABA-treated pepper plants than in those from control plants.
   - **CaAIPP1**-overexpressing plants displayed an ABA-hyposensitive phenotype during seed germination and seedling growth.
   - Our data indicate that **CaAIPP1** is a negative regulator of the drought stress response via ABA-mediated signalling.
