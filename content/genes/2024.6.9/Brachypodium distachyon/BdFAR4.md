## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BdFAR4</u>
- **Gene Name:** fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brachypodium distachyon*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **BdFAR4**, a root-specific fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase, is involved in fatty alcohol synthesis of root suberin polyester in Brachypodium distachyon.
   - **BdFAR4**, encoding a fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase (FAR) by a reverse genetic approach, and investigate the molecular relevance of **BdFAR4** in the root suberin synthesis of B. distachyon.
   - Overexpression of **BdFAR4** in B. distachyon and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) resulted in the accumulation of root suberin-associated C20:0 and C22:0 fatty alcohols, suggesting that **BdFAR4** preferentially accepts C20:0 and C22:0 fatty acyl-CoAs as substrates.
   - Taken together, these results imply that **BdFAR4** is essential for the production of root suberin-associated fatty alcohols, especially under stress conditions, and that its activity is transcriptionally regulated by the BdMYB41 transcription factor.
