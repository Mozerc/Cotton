## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>AaWRKY1</u>
- **Gene Name:** WRKY transcription factor 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Artemisia annua*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Isolation and Characterization of **AaWRKY1**, an Artemisia annua Transcription Factor that Regulates the Amorpha-4,11-diene Synthase Gene, a Key Gene of Artemisinin Biosynthesis.
   - **AaWRKY1** and ADS genes were highly expressed in GSTs and both were strongly induced by methyl jasmonate and chitosan. Transient expression analysis of the **AaWRKY1**â€“GFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter revealed that **AaWRKY1** was targeted to nuclei.
   - Transient expression of **AaWRKY1** cDNA in A. annua leaves clearly activated the expression of the majority of artemisinin biosynthetic genes.
   - These results strongly suggest the involvement of the **AaWRKY1** transcription factor in the regulation of artemisinin biosynthesis, and indicate that ADS is a target gene of **AaWRKY1** in A. annua.
