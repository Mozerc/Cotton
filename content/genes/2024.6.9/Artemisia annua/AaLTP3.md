## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>AaLTP3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Artemisia annua*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Lipid Transfer Proteins (**AaLTP3** and AaLTP4) Are Involved in Sesquiterpene Lactone Secretion from Glandular Trichomes in Artemisia annua.
   - The GUS signal driven by the **AaLTP3** or AaLTP4 promoter in transgenic A. annua plants revealed that the **AaLTP3** promoter was active on hair-like non-GTs and that the AaLTP4 promoter was active on GTs.
   - Overexpression of **AaLTP3** or AaLTP4 in transgenic A. annua plants resulted in enhanced production of sesquiterpene lactones (arteannuin B, artemisinin, dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid) compared with those of wild type.
   - The present study shows that LTP genes (**AaLTP3** or AaLTP4) play important roles in the sequestration and secretion of lipids in GTs of A. annua, which is useful for the enhanced production of sesquiterpene lactones by genetic engineering.
