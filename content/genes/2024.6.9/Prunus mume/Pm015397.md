## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Pm015397]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PmAP1–1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [The genome of Prunus mume(https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2290)]()
- **Species:** *Prunus mume*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - 3256 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were detected, and 20 candidate genes for double flower trait of P. mume were screened out including hub genes **PmAP1–1** and PmAG-2 based on DEGs function analysis and WGCNA analysis.
   - **PmAP1–1** was significantly down-regulated in S1 stage of double flower XLE compared with single flower DBLE, while PmAP1–2 was significantly up-regulated in S2 stage of XLE. 
   - It was found that epigenetic and hormone related genes (**PmAP1–1**,PmAP1–2) may also play an important role in the process of double flower.
