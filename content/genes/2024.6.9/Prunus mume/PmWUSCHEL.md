## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PmWUSCHEL|PmWUS</u>
- **Gene Name:** TF WUSCHEL
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Prunus mume*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of **PmWUSCHEL|PmWUS** (**PmWUSCHEL|PmWUS**) in the MP cultivar was significantly higher than that in the single-pistil (SP) cultivar, and the gene expression of its inhibitor, PmAGAMOUS (PmAG), also showed the same trend, indicating that other regulators participate in the regulation of **PmWUSCHEL|PmWUS** during this period.
   - This suggests that the regulation of **PmWUSCHEL|PmWUS** involves both transcription factors and epigenetic modifications.
   - This recruitment of PmLHP1 by PmAG inhibits the expression of **PmWUSCHEL|PmWUS** at the precise time, leading to the formation of 1 normal pistil primordium.
   - **PmWUSCHEL|PmWUS** regulates pistil morphogenesis through epigenetic modification.
