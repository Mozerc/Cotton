## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PmAGAMOUS|PmAG</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Prunus mume*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PmAGAMOUS|PmAG** recruits polycomb protein PmLHP1 to regulate single-pistil morphogenesis in Japanese apricot.
   - The expression of PmWUSCHEL (PmWUS) in the MP cultivar was significantly higher than that in the single-pistil (SP) cultivar, and the gene expression of its inhibitor, **PmAGAMOUS|PmAG** (**PmAGAMOUS|PmAG**), also showed the same trend, indicating that other regulators participate in the regulation of PmWUS during this period.
   - **PmAGAMOUS|PmAG** recruited sufficient PmLHP1 to maintain the level of H3K27me3 on PmWUS during the S2 of pistil development.
   - This recruitment of PmLHP1 by **PmAGAMOUS|PmAG** inhibits the expression of PmWUS at the precise time, leading to the formation of 1 normal pistil primordium.
