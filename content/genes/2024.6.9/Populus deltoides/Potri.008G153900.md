## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Potri.008G153900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PdPFD2.2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Populus deltoides*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PdPFD2.2** can physically interact with DELLA protein RGA1_8g, and its subcellular localization is affected by the interaction. In P. deltoides transgenic plants overexpressing **PdPFD2.2**, the lignin syringyl/guaiacyl ratio was increased, but cellulose content and crystallinity index were unchanged.
   - The cellulose content was not significantly affected in the Populus transgenic plants overexpressing **PdPFD2.2**, suggesting that the interaction of PFD2.2-DELLA is not directly involved in cellulose biosynthesis in Populus.
   - These results suggest that overexpression of **PdPFD2.2** can reduce biomass recalcitrance and **PdPFD2.2** is a promising target for genetic engineering to improve feedstock characteristics to enhance biofuel conversion and reduce the cost of lignocellulosic biofuel production.
   - The cellulose content was not significantly affected in the Populus transgenic plants overexpressing **PdPFD2.2**, suggesting that the interaction of PFD2.2-DELLA is not directly involved in cellulose biosynthesis in Populus.
