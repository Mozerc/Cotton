## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PttPHYA</u>
- **Gene Name:** PHYTOCHROME A
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Populus tremula L. × P. tremuloides*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Earlier studies have shown that the photoreceptor phytochrome A (phyA) promotes growth.
   - We describe studies in which the expression of endogenous Populus tremula × P. tremuloides PHYTOCHROME A (**PttPHYA**) was reduced in Populus trees by antisense inhibition.
   - Strong down-regulation of **PttPHYA** causes earlier timing of growth cessation and bud set under CDL.
   - The expression of genes involved in daylength detection is altered in a**PttPHYA** plants under SD.
   - We conclude that the level of **PttPHYA** expression strongly influences seasonally regulated growth in Populus and is central to co-ordination between internal clock-regulated rhythms and external light/dark cycles through its dual effect on the pace of clock rhythms and in light signaling.
