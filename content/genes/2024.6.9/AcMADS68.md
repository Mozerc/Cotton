## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>AcMADS68</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Actinidia chinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A new SEP gene, **AcMADS68**, was identified as a regulatory candidate for anthocyanin biosynthesis in the kiwifruit by transcriptome data and bioinformatic analyses.
   - **AcMADS68** co-overexpression increased anthocyanin biosynthesis, whereas its silencing reduced anthocyanin accumulation.
   - The results of the dual-luciferase reporter, firefly luciferase complementation, yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that **AcMADS68** could interact with both AcMYBF110 and AcMYB123 but not with AcbHLH1, thereby co-regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis by promoting the activation of the target genes, including AcANS, AcF3GT1, and AcGST1.
   - **AcMADS68** also could activate the promoter of AcbHLH1 surported by dual-luciferase reporter and yeast one-hybrid assays, thereby further amplifying the regulation signals from the MBW complex, thus resulting in enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in the kiwifruit.
   - Overexpression of **AcMADS68** and related TFs cause anthocyanin biosynthesis in kiwifruit.
