## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PtaRHE1</u>
- **Gene Name:** RING-H2 subgroup RHE protein1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Populus alba x Populus tremula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ectopic expression of **PtaRHE1**, encoding a poplar RING-H2 protein with E3 ligase activity, alters plant development and induces defence-related responses.
   - In the present report, experiments were performed to unravel the role of the poplar gene **PtaRHE1**, coding for a RING-H2 protein.
   - The overexpression of **PtaRHE1** in tobacco resulted in a pleiotropic phenotype characterized by a curling of the leaves, the formation of necrotic lesions on leaf blades, growth retardation, and a delay in floral transition.
   - These results suggest that the E3 ligase **PtaRHE1** plays a role in the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of defence response, possibly by acting upstream of WIPK and/or in the activation of WRKY factors.
