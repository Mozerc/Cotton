## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [GWHPAAYT014255]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbbZIP4</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus betulifolia*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcription factor **PbbZIP4** is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation by the ubiquitin ligase PbATL18 to influence pear's resistance to Colletotrichum fructicola by regulating the expression of PbNPR3.
   - Found that an E3 ubiquitin ligase, PbATL18, interacts with and ubiquitinates the transcription factor **PbbZIP4**, and this process is enhanced by C. fructicola infection. 
   - Silencing PbATL18 and **PbbZIP4** in Pyrus betulaefolia seedlings resulted in opposite effects, with **PbbZIP4** silencing enhancing resistance to C. fructicola infection and PbATL18 silencing increasing sensitivity to C. fructicola infection.
   - **PbbZIP4** was ubiquitinated by PbATL18 and degraded by the 26S proteasome, which decreased the expression of PbNPR3 and promoted SA signal transduction, thereby enhancing plant C. fructicola resistance.
