## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NbCMT3-2</u>
- **Gene Name:** chromomethylase3-2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana benthamiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Developmental- and Tissue-Specific Expression of **NbCMT3-2** Encoding a Chromomethylase in Nicotiana benthamiana.
   - **NbCMT3-2** was expressed mainly in proliferating tissues such as the shoot apex and developing leaves.
   - Virus-induced gene silencing used to knock down the expression of NbCMT3 or **NbCMT3-2** or both led to partial loss of genomic DNA methylation.
   - Plants with suppressed NbCMT3 expression grew and developed normally, whereas leaves with **NbCMT3-2** knockdown showed mild curling as compared with controls.
   -  The differential roles of NbCMT3 and **NbCMT3-2** were investigated and compared. We reveal the expression patterns of **NbCMT3-2** in proliferating tissues. **NbCMT3-2** may play an essential role in leaf development by modulating jasmonate pathways.
