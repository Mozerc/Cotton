## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Niben101Scf07608g00007]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NbCML30</u>
- **Gene Name:** calmodulin-like protein 30
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana benthamiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tobacco mosaic virus hijacks its coat protein-interacting protein IP-L to inhibit **NbCML30**, a calmodulin-like protein, to enhance its infection.
   - **NbCML30**, which lacks the EF-hand conserved domain and cannot bind to Ca2+, was located in the cytoplasm and nucleus and was downregulated by TMV infection.
   - **NbCML30** silencing promoted TMV infection, while its overexpression inhibited TMV infection by activating Ca2+-dependent oxidative stress in plants. 
   - **NbCML30**-mediated resistance to TMV mainly depends on IP-L regulation as the facilitation of TMV infection by silencing **NbCML30** was canceled by co-silencing **NbCML30** and IP-L.
   - TMV CP manipulates IP-L to inhibit **NbCML30**, influencing its Ca2+-dependent role in the oxidative stress response.
