## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Niben101Scf03570Ctg037]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NbMYB4L</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Sol Genomics Network(https://solgenomics.net)]()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana benthamiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ethylene-induced **NbMYB4L** is involved in resistance against tobacco mosaic virus in Nicotiana benthamiana.
   - Transcription of **NbMYB4L** was up-regulated in N. benthamiana infected with TMV. Silencing of **NbMYB4L** led to intensified TMV replication, whereas overexpression of **NbMYB4L** induced significant resistance to TMV.
   - Transcription of **NbMYB4L** was greater in 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC, ethylene precursor)-pretreated plants but lower when the ethylene signalling pathway was blocked during TMV infection.
   - These results point to NbEIL1 functioning as a positive regulator of **NbMYB4L** transcription in N. benthamiana against TMV. Collectively, our work reveals that EIL1 and MYB4L constitute a coherent feed-forward loop involved in the robust regulation of resistance to TMV in N. benthamiana.
