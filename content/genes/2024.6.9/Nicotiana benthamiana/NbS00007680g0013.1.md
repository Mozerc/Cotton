## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [NbS00007680g0013.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NbEXPA1</u>
- **Gene Name:** α-expansin protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana benthamiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **NbEXPA1**, an α-expansin, is plasmodesmata-specific and a novel host factor for potyviral infection.
   - Among the differentially accumulated PD protein candidates, we show that an α-expansin designated **NbEXPA1**, a cell wall loosening protein, is PD-specific.
   - Silencing of **NbEXPA1** inhibits plant growth and TuMV infection, whereas overexpression of **NbEXPA1** promotes viral replication and intercellular movement.
   - These data suggest that **NbEXPA1** is a host factor for potyviral infection. This study not only generates a PD-proteome dataset that is useful in future studies to expound PD biology and PD-mediated virus–host interactions but also characterizes **NbEXPA1** as the first PD-specific cell wall loosening protein and its essential role in potyviral infection.
