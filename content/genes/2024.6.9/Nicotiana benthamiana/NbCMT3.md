## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NbCMT3</u>
- **Gene Name:** chromomethylase protein 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana benthamiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Virus-induced gene silencing of **NbCMT3**/3-2 in N. benthamiana had pleiotropic effects on plant morphology, which indicates its indispensible role in development.
   - The formation of autophagosomes and starch degradation was disrupted in **NbCMT3**/**NbCMT3**-2-silenced plants, which implies a perturbed autophagic processes.
   - Studying genome-wide profiling of **NbCMT3**-mediated DNA methylation will be helpful to illustrate the effect of the plant-specific DNMT on development.
   - **NbCMT3**/**NbCMT3**-2 silencing had pleiotropic effects on development by interfering with NbBeclin 1 expression and autophagy-related processes.
