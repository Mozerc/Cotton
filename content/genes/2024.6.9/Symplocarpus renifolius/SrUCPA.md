## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SrUCPA</u>
- **Gene Name:** uncoupling protein 1 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Symplocarpus renifolius*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of the plant uncoupling protein, **SrUCPA**, expressed in spadix mitochondria of the thermogenic skunk cabbage.
   - Using spadix mitochondria, the uncoupling activity of **SrUCPA** was examined. Although **SrUCPA** transcripts were constitutively expressed in various tissues irrespective of thermogenic stage, the **SrUCPA** protein was detected only in the thermogenic tissue or stage.
   - Quantitative immunoblot analysis revealed that **SrUCPA** was an abundant protein in spadix mitochondria, accounting for about 3% of the total mitochondrial protein in the spadix. 
   - The results suggest that specific co-expression of **SrUCPA** and SrAOX protein in the thermogenic tissue or stage, as well as the high expression of **SrUCPA** protein in spadix mitochondria, may play a role in thermogenesis of skunk cabbage.
