## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsSEF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** putative CCCH-type zinc finger protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression of **CsSEF1** gene encoding putative CCCH zinc finger protein is induced by defoliation and prolonged darkness in cucumber fruit.
   - This increase in the expression of **CsSEF1** was temporally correlated with the decline in the fruit respiration rate. In mature leaves under prolonged darkness, enhanced expression was observed in the asparagine synthetase gene, but not in **CsSEF1**.
   - **CsSEF1** gene action is located somewhere in the signal transduction pathway from photoassimilate starvation to the growth cessation of sink tissues, but is independent of the local sugar-sensing pathway.
   - These results suggest that the asparagine synthetase gene can be a good marker for sugar starvation and that **CsSEF1** might be involved in the signal transduction pathway from photoassimilate limitation to growth cessation in cucumber fruit.
