## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa6M505860]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsWUS</u>
- **Gene Name:** WUSCHEL
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - CsSPL functions as an adaptor between HD-ZIP III and **CsWUS** transcription factors regulating anther and ovule development in cucumber.
   - Importantly, CsSPL directly interacted with **CsWUS** (WUSCHEL) in the nucellus and YABBY family genes in integuments, and positively regulated **CsWUS** expression, meanwhile the HD-ZIP III gene CsPHB (PHABULOSA), expressed specifically in the nucellus, promoted CsSPL expression by binding to the CsSPL promoter.
   - CsSPL acts as an adaptor to link CsPHB and **CsWUS** functioning, underpinning a previously unidentified regulatory pathway orchestrating sex organ development in planta.
   - CsSPL directly interacted with **CsWUS** in the nucellus, and CsPHV, CsPHB and CsARF13 were the upstream regulators of CsSPL by directly binding to the promoter of CsSPL in cucumber.
