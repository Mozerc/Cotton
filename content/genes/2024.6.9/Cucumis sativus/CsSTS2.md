## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsSTS2</u>
- **Gene Name:** STACHYOSE SYNTHASE 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Cucumber STACHYOSE SYNTHASE is regulated by its cis-antisense RNA asCsSTS to balance sourceâ€“sink carbon partitioning.
   - In contrast to sucrose-transporting plants, cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants mainly transport stachyose and stachyose synthase (CsSTS) synthesizes stachyose in the vasculature for loading.
   - In situ hybridization and tissue enrichment experiments revealed that a cis-natural antisense noncoding transcript of CsSTS, named asCsSTS, is mainly expressed in mesophyll tissues. In vitro overexpression (OE), RNA interference (RNAi), and dual luciferase reporter experiments indicated that CsSTSs are negatively regulated by asCsSTS.
   - Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that asCsSTS transcript localized in leaf cytoplasm, indicating that the regulation of CsSTS by asCsSTS is a posttranscriptional process.
   - Our results suggest that the regulation of CsSTSs between the mesophyll and vasculature reduces sugar storage in mesophyll tissue and promotes assimilate export from the leaf when the plant carries fruit.
