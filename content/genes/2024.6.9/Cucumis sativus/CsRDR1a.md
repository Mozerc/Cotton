## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsRDR1a</u>
- **Gene Name:** RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1a
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of all four CsRDR1 genes was induced by virus infection, after which the expression level of CsRDR1b increased 10â€“20-fold in several virus-resistant cucumber cultivars and in a broad virus-resistant transgenic cucumber line expressing a high level of transgene small RNAs, all without alteration in salicylic acid (SA) levels.
   - A constitutive high level of CsRDR1b gene expression independent of SA was found to be associated with broad virus resistance.
   - Multiple CsRDR1 genes are involved in virus resistance in cucumber and are regulated in a coordinated fashion with different expression profiles. These CsRDR1 genes may have either distinct or overlapping functions.
   - These findings show that multiple CsRDR1 genes are involved in virus resistance in cucumber and are regulated in a coordinated fashion with different expression profiles.
