## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa3G135120]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsERF31</u>
- **Gene Name:** ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR31
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A positive feedback loop mediated by **CsERF31** initiates female cucumber flower development.
   - Here, we used gene expression analysis, protein–DNA interaction assays, and transgenic plants to study the function of a gynoecium-specific gene, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR31 (**CsERF31**), in female flower differentiation.
   - Knockdown of **CsERF31** by RNAi causes defective bisexual flowers to replace female flowers. Ectopic expression of **CsERF31** suppresses stamen development and promotes pistil development in male flowers, demonstrating that **CsERF31** functions as a sex switch.
   - Our data confirm that **CsERF31** represents the molecular link between female–male determination and female–bisexual determination, and provide mechanistic insight into how ethylene promotes female flowers, rather than bisexual flowers, in cucumber sex determination.
   - Constitutive expression of **CsERF31** in cucumber promotes pistil development and arrests the stamen.
