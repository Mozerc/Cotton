## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Csa5M471600]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsPM5.2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Powdery mildew 5.2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CsPM5.2**, a phosphate transporter protein-like gene, promotes powdery mildew resistance in cucumber.
   - Through fine mapping, the dominant PM resistance gene, **CsPM5.2**, was cloned and its function was confirmed by transgenic complementation and natural variation identification.
   - **CsPM5.2** encodes a phosphate transporter-like protein PHO1|H3 and its expression, although ubiquitous, is also induced by PM pathogens. Transcriptome analysis suggested that the SA pathway may play an important role in **CsPM5.2**-mediated PM resistance.
   - In cultivar 9930, a dysfunctional **CsPM5.2** mutant resulted from a single nucleotide polymorphism in the coding region and endowed susceptibility to PM.
