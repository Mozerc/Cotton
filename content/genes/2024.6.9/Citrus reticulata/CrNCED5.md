## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CrNCED5</u>
- **Gene Name:** 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 5 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus reticulata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - An R2R3-MYB transcription factor represses the transformation of α- and β-branch carotenoids by negatively regulating expression of CrBCH2 and **CrNCED5** in flavedo of Citrus reticulate.
   - A comprehensive analysis of developing and harvested fruits indicated that reduced expression of β-carotene hydroxylases 2 (CrBCH2) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 5 (**CrNCED5**) was responsible for the delay in the transformation of α- and β-carotene and the biosynthesis of ABA.
   - Report that the transformation of α- and β- branch carotenoids was indeed delayed in MT and that an MYB TF (CrMYB68) can repress the transformation of α- and β-branch carotenoids by directly suppressing the expression of CrBCH2 and **CrNCED5**.
   - CrMYB68 bound to the promoters of CrBCH2 and **CrNCED5** and significantly inhibited their expression.
