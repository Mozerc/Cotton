## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CrBCH2</u>
- **Gene Name:** β-carotene hydroxylases 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus reticulata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - An R2R3-MYB transcription factor represses the transformation of α- and β-branch carotenoids by negatively regulating expression of **CrBCH2** and CrNCED5 in flavedo of Citrus reticulate.
   - A comprehensive analysis of developing and harvested fruits indicated that reduced expression of β-carotene hydroxylases 2 (**CrBCH2**) and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 5 (CrNCED5) was responsible for the delay in the transformation of α- and β-carotene and the biosynthesis of ABA.
   - Report that the transformation of α- and β- branch carotenoids was indeed delayed in MT and that an MYB TF (CrMYB68) can repress the transformation of α- and β-branch carotenoids by directly suppressing the expression of **CrBCH2** and CrNCED5.
   - CrMYB68 bound to the promoters of **CrBCH2** and CrNCED5 and significantly inhibited their expression.
