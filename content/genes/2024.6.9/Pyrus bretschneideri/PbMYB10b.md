## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbMYB10b</u>
- **Gene Name:** MYB10b transcription factor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus bretschneideri*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Among these MYB-like genes, the specific functions of two novel MYB TFs, designated as **PbMYB10b** and PbMYB9, were further verified by both overexpression and RNAi transient assays.
   - **PbMYB10b**, a PAP-type MYB TF with atypical motifs in its conserved region, regulated the anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin pathways by inducing the expression of PbDFR, but its function could be complemented by other MYB TFs.
   - **PbMYB10b** was identified as the activator of the anthocyanin and PA pathways, and PbMYB9 as the activator of the PA, anthocyanin, and flavonol pathways.
   - **PbMYB10b** is an activator of PA biosynthesis and anthocyanin biosynthesis.
