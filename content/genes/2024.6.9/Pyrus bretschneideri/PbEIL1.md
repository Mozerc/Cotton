## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbEIL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene-insensitive 3-like
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus bretschneideri*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PbEIL1** acts upstream of PbCysp1 to regulate ovule senescence in seedless pear.
   - Yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays revealed the interaction of the transcription factor and the promoter DNA sequence and demonstrated that **PbEIL1** enhanced the action of PbCysp1.
   - At the same time, ethylene overaccumulated in ovules, where cells were sensitive to ethylene signals in the absence of fertilization. We identified a transcription factor in the ethylene signal response, ethylene-insensitive 3-like (EIL1), as a likely participant in ovule senescence
   - Overexpression of **PbEIL1** in tomato caused precocious onset of ovule senescence. We further found that EIL1 could directly bind to the promoter of the SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED CYSTEINE PROTEINASE 1 (PbCysp1) gene and act upstream of senescence.
