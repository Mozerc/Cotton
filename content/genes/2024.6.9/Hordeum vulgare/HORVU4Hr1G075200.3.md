## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [HORVU4Hr1G075200.3]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvSUT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose transporter 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Down-regulation of the sucrose transporters **HvSUT1** and HvSUT2 affects sucrose homeostasis along its delivery path in barley grains.
   - Expression of **HvSUT1** and HvSUT2 overlap temporally and spatially, suggesting concerted functions to regulate sucrose homeostasis. Using HvSUT2-RNAi plants, we found that grains were also deficient in **HvSUT1** expression and seemingly sucrose-limited during mid-to-late grain filling.
   - It was found that RNAi-mediated repression of HvSUT2 also resulted in down-regulation of **HvSUT1** and led to accumulation of sucrose along the sucrose delivery route in the nucellar projection, the endosperm transfer cells, and the starchy endosperm, although grains become apparently sucrose-limited.
   - Localization studies indicate that barley (Hordeum vulgare) sucrose transporter **HvSUT1** functions in sucrose uptake into seeds during grain filling.
   - The results suggest that both HvSUT2 and **HvSUT1** control sucrose homeostasis during grain filling. Their deficiency affects maturation and certain biosynthetic pathways, and initiates sugar starvation-induced salvage of resources.
