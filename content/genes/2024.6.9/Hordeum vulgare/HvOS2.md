## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvOS2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Fine-tuning of the flowering time control in winter barley: the importance of **HvOS2** and HvVRN2 in non-inductive conditions.
   - The flowering promoter gene in short days, HvFT3, was only expressed after receiving induction of cold or plant age, which was associated with low transcript levels of HvVRN2 and **HvOS2**.
   - **HvOS2**, an ortholog of FLC, appears as a strong candidate to mediate in the vernalization response of barley.
   - Future research will be needed to ascertain the involvement of **HvOS2** in the vernalization mechanism and the effect of the polymorphisms found in coding and non-coding sequences.
