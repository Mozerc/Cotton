## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvALMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Aluminum-Activated Malate Transporter 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **HvALMT1** from barley is involved in the transport of organic anions.
   - **HvALMT1** is located on chromosome 2H which has not been associated with Al3+ resistance in barley. The relatively low levels of **HvALMT1** expression detected in root and shoot tissues were independent of external aluminium or phosphorus supply.
   - GFP fused to the C-terminus of the full **HvALMT1** protein localized to the plasma membrane and motile vesicles within the cytoplasm.
   - Both malate uptake and efflux were confirmed in oocyte assays using [14C]malate as a radiotracer. It is suggested that **HvALMT1** functions as an anion channel to facilitate organic anion transport in stomatal function and expanding cells.
