## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvCO9</u>
- **Gene Name:**  CONSTANS-like9
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The differential expression of **HvCO9**, a member of the CONSTANS-like gene family, contributes to the control of flowering under short-day conditions in barley.
   - **HvCO9** was characterized to elucidate the barley flowering control mechanisms and to investigate the functional diversification of the barley CONSTANS-like (CO-like) genes in flowering.
   - **HvCO9** was located on the same chromosome, 1HL, as Ppd-H2 (HvFT3), which is a positive regulator of short-day (SD) flowering.
   - hese results suggest that **HvCO9** may act as a negative regulator of flowering under non-inductive SD conditions in barley| this activity is similar to that of rice Ghd7 under non-inductive LD conditions, but the functional targets of these genes may be different.
