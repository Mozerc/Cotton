## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvIcy-2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The induced expression of **HvIcy-2** by the fungal stress correlated to a higher susceptibility of silencing **HvIcy-2** plants. 
   - A reduction in the expression of **HvIcy-2** and in the cathepsin-L and -B like activities in the silencing **HvIcy-2** plants was not accompanied by apparent phenotypical differences with control plants in response to light deprivation.
   - We suggest that **HvIcy-2** may have a role in fungal protection.
   - This effect could partially explain the lower cathepsin activity showed by silencing **HvIcy-2** lines after darkness treatment and supports that responses to different stresses are accompanied to molecular alterations with striking compensation effects at the transcriptional level.
