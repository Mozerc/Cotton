## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvPAP14</u>
- **Gene Name:** papain-like cysteine proteinase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **HvPAP14**, which belongs to the C1A family of cysteine proteases, was identified in senescing barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaves by affinity enrichment using the mechanism-based probe DCG-04 targeting cysteine proteases and subsequent mass spectrometry.
   - Biochemical analyses and expression of a **HvPAP14**:RFP fusion construct in barley protoplasts was used to identify the subcellular localization and putative substrates of **HvPAP14**.
   - Overexpression of **HvPAP14** in barley revealed that the protease can cleave LHCB proteins and PSBO as well as the large subunit of Rubisco.
   - **HvPAP14** is involved in the normal turnover of chloroplast proteins and may have a function in bulk protein degradation during leaf senescence.
