## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [HORVU7Hr1G054710]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvSWEET11b</u>
- **Gene Name:** Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter 11
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A radiotracer assay revealed that expressing **HvSWEET11b** in African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) oocytes facilitated the bidirectional transfer of not only just sucrose and glucose, but also cytokinin.
   - Barley plants harboring a loss-of-function mutation of **HvSWEET11b** could not set viable grains, while the distribution of sucrose and cytokinin was altered in developing grains of plants in which the gene was knocked down.
   - Decreasing **HvSWEET11b** expression in developing grains reduced overall grain size, sink strength, the number of endopolyploid endosperm cells, and the contents of starch and protein.
   - The control exerted by **HvSWEET11b** over sugars and cytokinins likely predetermines their synergy, resulting in adjustments to the grain's biochemistry and transcriptome.
