## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>HvFT3|PPDH2</u>
- **Gene Name:** FT-like protein 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Hordeum vulgare*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression analysis of vernalization and day-length response genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) indicates that VRNH2 is a repressor of **HvFT3|PPDH2** (**HvFT3|PPDH2**) under long days.
   - Further analysis of **HvFT3|PPDH2** expression in two barley doubled haploid populations revealed that, under long days, **HvFT3|PPDH2** and VRNH2 expression levels were related inversely.
   - **HvFT3|PPDH2** is expressed at a lower level under long days than under short days, which suggests that a promoter of **HvFT3|PPDH2** is activated more strongly under conditions of short days or there is an additional repressor activity under conditions of long days.
   - **HvFT3|PPDH2** has been identified as a candidate gene for **HvFT3|PPDH2**, which is described as a gene that is responsive to a short photoperiod.
