## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MELO3C006209]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CmLHP1A</u>
- **Gene Name:** LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - CmLHP1 proteins play a key role in plant development and sex determination in melon.
   - Here we show that melon homologs to Arabidopsis LHP1, **CmLHP1A** and B, redundantly control several aspects of plant development, including sex expression.
   - **CmLHP1A**b double mutants displayed an overall loss and redistribution of H3K27me3, leading to a deregulation of genes involved in hormone responses, plant architecture, and flower development.
   - These results reveal a novel function for CmLHP1 proteins in maintenance of monoecy and provide novel insights into the polycomb-mediated epigenomic regulation of sex lability in plants.
