## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MELO3C009145]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PDC1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Plant pyruvate decarboxylase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PDC1**, a pyruvate/α-ketoacid decarboxylase, is involved in acetaldehyde, propanal and pentanal biosynthesis in melon.
   - In vitro biochemical characterization of the recombinant **PDC1** enzyme showed that it could not only decarboxylate pyruvate, but that it also had significant activity toward other straight- and branched-chain α-ketoacids, greatly expanding the range of substrates previously known to be accepted by the plant enzyme.
   - RNAi-mediated transient and stable silencing of **PDC1** expression in melon showed that this gene is involved in acetaldehyde, propanal and pentanal production, while it does not contribute to branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-derived aldehyde biosynthesis in melon fruit.
   - Our work shows that **PDC1** is not only involved in acetaldehyde biosynthesis, but also forms propanal and pentanal in the fruit, while PDC2 does not contribute significantly to the production of these volatile aldehydes.
