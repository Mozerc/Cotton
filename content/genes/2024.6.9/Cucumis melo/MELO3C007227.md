## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MELO3C007227]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PDC2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Plant pyruvate decarboxylase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In an effort to elucidate the biochemical pathways involved in volatile aldehyde biosynthesis en route ester formation in melon, we identified two genes (PDC1 and **PDC2**) expressed in ripe melon fruits and exhibiting high homology to plant pyruvate decarboxylases.
   - The only other α-ketoacid decarboxylase expressed in fruit, **PDC2**, does not appear to make a significant contribution to volatile formation in ripe melon. 
   - Our work shows that PDC1 is not only involved in acetaldehyde biosynthesis, but also forms propanal and pentanal in the fruit, while **PDC2** does not contribute significantly to the production of these volatile aldehydes.
