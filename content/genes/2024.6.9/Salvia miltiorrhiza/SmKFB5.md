## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SmKFB5</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Salvia miltiorrhiza*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SmKFB5** protein regulates phenolic acid biosynthesis by controlling the degradation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in Salvia miltiorrhiza.
   - Demonstrate that the S. miltiorrhiza Kelch repeat F-box protein **SmKFB5** physically interacts with three phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) isozymes and mediates their proteolytic turnover via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway.
   - Disturbing the expression of **SmKFB5** reciprocally affected the abundance of SmPAL protein and the accumulation of phenolic acids, suggesting that **SmKFB5** is a post-translational regulator responsible for the turnover of PAL and negatively controlling phenolic acids.
   - Taken together, our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which **SmKFB5** mediates the regulation of phenolic acid biosynthesis by jasmonic acid, and suggest valuable targets for plant breeders in tailoring new cultivars.
