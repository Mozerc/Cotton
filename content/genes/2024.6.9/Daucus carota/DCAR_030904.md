## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [DCAR_030904]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DcCCD4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Daucus carota*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DcCCD4** catalyzes the degradation of α-carotene and β-carotene to affect carotenoid accumulation and taproot color in carrot.
   - In this study, through expression analysis, we found that the expression level of **DcCCD4** was significantly higher in the taproot of white carrot (low carotenoid content) than orange carrot (high carotenoid content).
   - The overexpression of **DcCCD4** in orange carrots caused the taproot color to be pale yellow, and the contents of α- and β-carotene decreased sharply.
   - The number of colored chromoplasts in the taproot cells of transgenic carrots overexpressing **DcCCD4** was significantly reduced compared with that in normal orange carrots.
   - Results showed that **DcCCD4** affects the accumulation of carotenoids through cleavage of α- and β-carotene in carrot taproot.
