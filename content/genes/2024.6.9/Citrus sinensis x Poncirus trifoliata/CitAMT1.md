## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CitAMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ammonium transporter1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus sinensis x Poncirus trifoliata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ammonium transport and **CitAMT1** expression are regulated by N in Citrus plants.
   - Citrus seedlings (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck × Poncirus trifoliata Blanco) were used to describe the effects of different N treatments on the NH4 + influx mediated by high- and low-affinity transport systems (HATS and LATS, respectively) and **CitAMT1** gene expression.
   - Furthermore, NH4 + exerts a regulatory effect on NH4 + HATS activity and **CitAMT1** expression, both are down-regulated by high N status of the plant, but specifically stimulated by NH4 + and the balance between these two opposite effects depends on the prior nutrition regime of the plant.
   - Ammonium transport and **CitAMT1** expression are regulated by light and sucrose in Citrus plants.
   - To explain this discrepancy, it is possible that other **CitAMT1** transporters, up-regulated by N limitation, but not repressed by NO3 − could be involved in the stimulation of NH4 + HATS activity under pure NO3 − nutrition or **CitAMT1** transporter could be regulated at the post-transcriptional level.
