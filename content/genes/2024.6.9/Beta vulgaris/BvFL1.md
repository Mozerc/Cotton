## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BvFL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** FLC-like 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Beta vulgaris*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - EcoTILLING in Beta vulgaris reveals polymorphisms in the FLC-like gene **BvFL1**that are associated with annuality and winter hardiness.
   - EcoTILLING identified 20 silent SNPs and one non-synonymous SNP within the genes BTC1, **BvFL1** and BvFT1, resulting in 55 haplotypes. Further, we detected associations of nucleotide polymorphisms in **BvFL1** with bolting before winter as well as winter hardiness.
   - These data provide the first genetic indication for the function of the FLC homolog **BvFL1** in beet. Further, it demonstrates for the first time that EcoTILLING is a powerful method for exploring genetic diversity and allele mining in B. vulgaris.
   - Constitutive expression of **BvFL1** in an FLC null mutant of Arabidopsis significantly delayed flowering, suggesting at least partial evolutionary conservation of function between FLC homologs in Arabidopsis and beet.
