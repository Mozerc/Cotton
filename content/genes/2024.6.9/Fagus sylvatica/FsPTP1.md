## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FsPTP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** protein tyrosine phosphatase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fagus sylvatica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional analysis in Arabidopsis of **FsPTP1**, a tyrosine phosphatase from beechnuts, reveals its role as a negative regulator of ABA signaling and seed dormancy and suggests its involvement in ethylene signaling modulation.
   - By means of an RT-PCR approach we isolated a specific tyrosine phosphatase (**FsPTP1**) induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and correlated with seed dormancy in Fagus sylvatica seeds.
   - As a result, 35S:**FsPTP1** transgenic seeds showed a reduced dormancy and insensitivity to ABA and osmotic stress conditions accompanied by a reduction in the level of expression of RAB18 and RD29, well-known ABA-responsive genes.
   - In addition, phenotypes of **FsPTP1** transgenic plants resemble those observed in ethylene constitutive mutants, accompanied by an increase in the level of expression of a key gene involved in ethylene signaling such as EIN2.
