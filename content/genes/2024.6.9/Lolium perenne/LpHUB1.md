## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>LpHUB1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Bronsyn LE HUB1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Lolium perenne*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of ubiquitin-like **LpHUB1** gene confers drought tolerance in perennial ryegrass.
   - A HUB1 gene, **LpHUB1**, was identified from serial analysis of gene expression data and cloned from perennial ryegrass. The expression of this gene was reported previously to be elevated in pastures during the summer and by drought stress in climate-controlled growth chambers.
   - Pasture-type and turf-type transgenic perennial ryegrass plants overexpressing **LpHUB1** showed improved drought tolerance, as evidenced by improved turf quality, maintenance of turgor and increased growth.
   - **LpHUB1**, which belongs to the HUB1 subfamily of Ubl genes. Overexpression of **LpHUB1** in both pasture- and turf-type perennial ryegrasses greatly enhanced the tolerance of these plants to drought stresses.
