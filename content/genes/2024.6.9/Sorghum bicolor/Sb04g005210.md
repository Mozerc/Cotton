## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Sb04g005210]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Bmr2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Brown midrib2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Sorghum bicolor*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Brown midrib2 (**Bmr2**) encodes the major 4-coumarate:coenzymeA ligase involved in lignin biosynthesis in sorghum.
   - **Bmr2** is the most highly expressed 4CL in sorghum stems, leaves and roots, both at the seedling stage and in pre-flowering plants, but the products of several paralogs also display 4CL activity and compensate for some of the lost activity. 
   - The contribution of the paralogs varies between developmental stages and tissues. Gene expression assays indicated that **Bmr2** is under auto-regulatory control, as reduced 4CL activity results in over-expression of the defective gene.
   - We show here that the **Bmr2** mutation is located in one of the sorghum 4CL genes, and that the **Bmr2** mutant phenotype provides evidence for a major but not exclusive role for this 4CL gene in lignification.
