## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Lpx-B1.2</u>
- **Gene Name:** lipoxygenase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Triticum turgidum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Insight into durum wheat Lpx-B1: a small gene family coding for the lipoxygenase responsible for carotenoid bleaching in mature grains.
   - Two Lpx-1 genes have been identified on chromosome 4B, Lpx-B1.1 and **Lpx-B1.2**, and evidences have been reported that the deletion of Lpx-B1.1 is associated with a strong reduction in LOX activity in semolina.
   - In this germplasm collection, the Lpx-B1 gene family accounts for most of the total LOX activity in the mature grains.
   - Information on these Lpx-B1 haplotypes provides significant improvement for prediction of LOX-1 activity levels in mature grains, and will therefore help in breeding programmes aimed at selection of new durum wheat genotypes with higher carotenoid contents in their end products.
