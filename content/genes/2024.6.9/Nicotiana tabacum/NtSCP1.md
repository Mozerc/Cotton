## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NtSCP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** serine carboxypeptidase III
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We isolated cDNAs for two extracellular serine carboxypeptidase III genes from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), **NtSCP1** and NtSCP2, belonging to a phylogenetic clade not yet functionally characterized in plants.
   - **NtSCP1** and NtSCP2 are orthologs derived from the two ancestors of tobacco. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that **NtSCP1** and NtSCP2 are expressed in root, stem, leaf, and flower tissues.
   - Western blotting of **NtSCP1** and expression of an **NtSCP1**-green fluorescent protein fusion protein showed that the protein is located in the extracellular space of tobacco leaves and culture cells. Purified His-tagged **NtSCP1** had carboxypeptidase activity in vitro.
   - **NtSCP1** showed a reduced flower length due to a decrease in cell size. Etiolated seedlings of these transgenic plants had shorter hypocotyls. These data provide support for a role of an extracellular type III carboxypeptidase in the control of cell elongation.
