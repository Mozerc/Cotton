## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>RhoGAP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** GTPase activating protein1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In vivo Rac/Rop localization as well as interaction with RhoGAP and RhoGDI in tobacco pollen tubes: analysis by low-level expression of fluorescent fusion proteins and bimolecular fluorescence complementation.
   - Mutant variants of Rac/Rop GTPases lacking specific functions are important tools to investigate these mechanisms, and have been employed to develop a model suggesting that RhoGAP (GTPase activating protein) and RhoGDI (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor) mediated recycling of Rac/Rop GTPases maintains apical polarization of Rac/Rop activity in pollen tubes, which elongate by ‘tip growth’ (an extreme form of polar cell growth).
   - Extensive fluorescent protein tagging and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analyses are described of the intracellular distributions of wild type and mutant variants of the tobacco pollen tube Rac/Rop GTPase Nt-Rac5, as well as of interactions of these Nt-Rac5 variants with RhoGAP and RhoGDI proteins, in normally growing transiently transformed pollen tubes. 
   - Presented results substantially enhance our understanding of apical dynamics of pollen tube Rac/Rop signaling proteins, confirm previously proposed RhoGAP and RhoGDI functions in Rac/Rop polarization and provide important technical insights facilitating future in vivo protein localization and BiFC experiments in pollen tubes.
