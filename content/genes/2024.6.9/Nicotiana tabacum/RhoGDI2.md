## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>RhoGDI2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis shows in vivo interaction between wild type Nt-Rac5 and Nt-**RhoGDI2** fusion proteins.
   - The results of this study strongly support the model of Nt-RhoGAP1 and Nt-**RhoGDI2** functions in the apical polarization of Nt-Rac5 activity described above, and enhance our understanding of apical dynamics of Rac/Rop signaling proteins.
   - This observation demonstrates that Nt-**RhoGDI2** can interact with membrane-associated Nt-Rac5, as required for the proposed recycling mechanism.
   - Confirmation of this model by the analysis of in situ interactions between Nt-Rac5 variants and Nt-RhoGAP1 or Nt-**RhoGDI2** in living pollen tubes has been missing.
