## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NtPDR3</u>
- **Gene Name:** pleiotropic drug resistance protein 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Nicotiana tabacum ABC transporter **NtPDR3** secretes O-methylated coumarins in response to iron deficiency.
   - Prevention of **NtPDR3** expression resulted in N. tabacum plants that were less tolerant to iron-deficient conditions, displaying stronger chlorosis and slower growth than those of the wild-type when not supplied with iron.
   - Metabolic profiling of roots and root exudates revealed that, upon iron deficiency, secretion of catechol-bearing O-methylated coumarins such as fraxetin, hydroxyfraxetin, and methoxyfraxetin to the rhizosphere was compromised in **NtPDR3**-silenced plants. However, exudation of flavins such as riboflavin was not markedly affected by **NtPDR3**-silencing.
   - The results demonstrate that N. tabacum secretes both coumarins and flavins in response to iron deficiency and that **NtPDR3** plays an essential role in the plant response to iron deficiency by mediating secretion of O-methylated coumarins to the rhizosphere.
