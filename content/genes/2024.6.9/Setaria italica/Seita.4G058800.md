## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Seita.4G058800]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SiSTL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Setaria italica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SiSTL1**, encoding a large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, is crucial for plant growth, chloroplast biogenesis, and cell cycle progression in Setaria italica.
   - Identified a RNR large subunit mutant, **SiSTL1**, in Setaria italica (foxtail millet), which exhibited growth retardation as well as striped leaf phenotype, i.e. irregularly reduced leaf vein distances and decreased chloroplast biogenesis.
   - Determined that a Gly737 to Glu substitution occurring in the C-terminus of the **SiSTL1** protein slightly affected its optimal function, leading in turn to the reduced expression of genes variously involved in the assembly and activation of the DNA pre-replicative complex, elongation of replication forks and S phase entry.
   - Our study provides new insights into how **SiSTL1** regulates plant growth, chloroplast biogenesis, and cell cycle progression in Poaceae crops.
