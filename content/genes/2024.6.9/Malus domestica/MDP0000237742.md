## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000237742]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMAPK3</u>
- **Gene Name:** MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ethylene enhances **MdMAPK3**-mediated phosphorylation of MdNAC72 to promote apple fruit softening.
   - Identified apple MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (**MdMAPK3**) as an important positive regulator of ethylene-induced apple fruit softening during storage.
   - **MdMAPK3** interacts with and phosphorylates the transcription factor NAM-ATAF1/2-CUC2 72 (MdNAC72), which functions as a transcriptional repressor of the cell wall degradation-related gene POLYGALACTURONASE1 (MdPG1).
   - The increase in **MdMAPK3** kinase activity was induced by ethylene, which promoted the phosphorylation of MdNAC72 by **MdMAPK3**. Additionally, MdPUB24 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate MdNAC72, resulting in its degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway, which was enhanced by ethylene-induced phosphorylation of MdNAC72 by **MdMAPK3**.
   - This study thus reveals that the ethylene–**MdMAPK3**–MdNAC72–MdPUB24 module is involved in ethylene-induced apple fruit softening, providing insights into climacteric fruit softening.
