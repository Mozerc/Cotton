## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000517257]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdERF2</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene response factor 2
- **Genome:** [apple genome database ( http://www.rosaceae.org)]()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Apple (Malus domestica) **MdERF2** negatively affects ethylene biosynthesis during fruit ripening by suppressing MdACS1 transcription.
   - Here we show that an apple (Malus domestica) ethylene response factor, **MdERF2**, negatively affects ethylene biosynthesis and fruit ripening by suppressing the transcription of MdACS1, a gene that is critical for biosynthesis of ripening-related ethylene.
   - Expression of **MdERF2** was suppressed by ethylene during ripening of apple fruit, and we observed that **MdERF2** bound to the promoter of MdACS1 and directly suppressed its transcription.
   - Our results indicate that **MdERF2** negatively affects ethylene biosynthesis and fruit ripening in apple by suppressing the transcription of MdACS1 via multiple mechanisms, thereby acting as an antagonist of positive ripening regulators.
