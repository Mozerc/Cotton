## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000237124]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdPSY2</u>
- **Gene Name:** phytoene synthase2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The first committed carotenoid pathway step in apple is controlled by MdPSY1 and **MdPSY2**, while MdPSY4 play little or no role in this respect.
   - MdPSY1 and **MdPSY2** constructs in cells with pACCRTE produced phytoene, with a peak whose retention time and spectral qualities were similar to the positive control. Similarly, Î”crtB cells produced zeaxanthin diglucoside when transformed with MdPSY1 and **MdPSY2** constructs.
   - Both MdPSY1 and **MdPSY2** were co-localised with chlorophyll in the chloroplast confirming they are translocated to plastids.
   - The possibility of different transcriptional mechanisms controlling the different expression of apple MdPSY1 and **MdPSY2** is supported by the significant sequence differences in their promoters as well as the varied responses to transient activation by the AP2/ERF transcription factors we tested.
