## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000295218]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMYB110a_JP</u>
- **Gene Name:** transcription factor MYB110
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Expression and functional analysis of a novel MYB gene, **MdMYB110a_JP**, responsible for red flesh, not skin color in apple fruit.
   - We have succeeded in isolating an **MdMYB110a_JP** gene responsible for a red-fleshed trait from a fruit of apple cultivar ‘JPP35’ (‘Jonathan’ × ‘Pink Pearl’).
   - From the results, it was strongly suggested that the red-fleshed phenotype of ‘JPP35’ fruit was caused by up-regulation of the genes of anthocyanin pathway induced by the **MdMYB110a_JP** gene.
   - The red leaf phenotype observed in the transgenic apple plants overexpressing the **MdMYB110a_JP** gene strongly suggests that this MYB transcriptional factor is functionally active in apple.
