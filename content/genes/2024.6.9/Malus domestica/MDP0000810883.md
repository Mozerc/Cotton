## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000810883]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Ma10</u>
- **Gene Name:** pyrophosphate-energized proton pump
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Ma10** gene encodes a tonoplast P3A H+-ATPase that is involved in the regulation of apple fruit acidity.
   - A type II P3A-type ATPase gene, **Ma10**, was showed to be involved in the vacuolar acidification of apple fruit.
   - A **Ma10** gene encoding P-type ATPase is involved in fruit organic acid accumulation in apple.
   - Overexpression of the **Ma10** gene can complement the defect in proton transport of the mutant YAK2 yeast strain and enhance the accumulation of malic acid in apple callus.
