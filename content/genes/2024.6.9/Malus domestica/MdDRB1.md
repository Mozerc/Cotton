## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdDRB1</u>
- **Gene Name:** dsRNA-binding protein1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A dsRNA-binding protein **MdDRB1** associated with miRNA biogenesis modifies adventitious rooting and tree architecture in apple.
   - Following expression analysis, RNA binding and protein interaction assays, **MdDRB1** was transformed into apple callus and in vitro tissue cultures to characterize the functions of **MdDRB1** in miRNA biogenesis, adventitious rooting, leaf development and tree growth habit.
   - Transgenic analysis showed that **MdDRB1** controls adventitious rooting, leaf curvature and tree architecture by modulating the accumulation of miRNAs and the transcript levels of miRNA target genes. 
   - Our results demonstrated that **MdDRB1** functions in the miRNA biogenesis in a conserved way and that it is a master regulator in the formation of economically important traits in fruit trees.
