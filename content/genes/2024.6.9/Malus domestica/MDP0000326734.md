## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000326734]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Md-PG1</u>
- **Gene Name:**  polygalacturonase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A candidate gene based approach validates **Md-PG1** as the main responsible for a QTL impacting fruit texture in apple.
   - The newly developed **Md-PG1**SSR10kd microsatellite marker was further amplified and integrated into the ‘Fuji × Delearly’ genetic map, where several QTLs for apple fruit texture were previously mapped, and among which the major hot-spot cluster coincided with **Md-PG1** gene.
   - **Md-PG1**, a key gene belonging to the polygalacturonase gene family, was mapped on chromosome 10 and co-localized within the statistical interval of a major hot spot QTL associated to several fruit texture sub-phenotypes.
   - The impact of **Md-PG1** in the fruit cell wall disassembly was further confirmed by the cortex structure electron microscope scanning in two apple varieties characterized by opposite texture performance, such as ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Granny Smith’.
