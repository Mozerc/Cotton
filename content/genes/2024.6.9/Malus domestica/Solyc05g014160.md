## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Solyc05g014160]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Sl-RGS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** G protein signaling 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - RGS1 negatively regulates disease resistance and is required for glucose-enhanced defense under low light.
   - These results together indicate that tomato RGS1 functions negatively in plant defense to Pst DC3000 and that RGS1 is required for Glc-regulated defense under low light conditions, which is independent of SA and JA signaling pathways.
   - Analysis of G protein single and double mutants revealed that RGS1 negatively regulates disease resistance under low light and is required for Glc-enhanced defense.
   - Downstream of RGS1-Glc binding, GPA1 negatively mediates the light-intensity-regulated defense, whereas SlGB1 positively regulates this process.
   - Glucose sensing by regulator of G protein signaling 1 (RGS1) plays a crucial role in coordinating defense in response to environmental variation in tomato.
