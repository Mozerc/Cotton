## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdGAD1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MdGAD1** was identified as a possible key gene for GABA synthesis in apple. Further analysis indicated that **MdGAD1** promoted antioxidant capacity to improve apple GLS resistance in transgenic apple calli and leaves. 
   - The key GABA synthesis gene, **MdGAD1**, was identified in apple, and it was found that the MdWRKY33-**MdGAD1** module positively regulated apple GLS.
   - These results suggest that **MdGAD1** increased endogenous GABA synthesis to improve resistance to apple GLS via antioxidant capacity.
   - These results indicate that MdWRKY33-**MdGAD1** enhances the accumulation of GABA and improves the resistance of apples to GLS.
