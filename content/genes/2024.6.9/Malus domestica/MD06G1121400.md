## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD06G1121400]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdSND1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Dual role of **MdSND1** in the biosynthesis of lignin and in signal transduction in response to salt and osmotic stress in apple.
   - Compared with wild-type GL-3 plants, **MdSND1**-overexpressing apple plants with greater antioxidant capacity and lignin were more resistant to salt and simulated osmotic stress, while RNAi plants were more vulnerable.
   - Additionally, molecular experiments confirmed that **MdSND1** could regulate the biosynthesis of lignin by activating the transcription of MdMYB46/83.
   - **MdSND1** also participates in the regulation of the stress signal transduction pathway by activating the expression of stress-responsive genes.
   - The above results revealed that **MdSND1** is directly involved in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis and the signal transduction pathway involved in the response to both salt and osmotic stress in apple.
