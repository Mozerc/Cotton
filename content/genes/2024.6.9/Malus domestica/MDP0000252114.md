## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000252114]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMa1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Ma locus
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transcriptional repression of **MdMa1** by MdMYB21 in Ma locus decreases malic acid content in apple fruit.
   - A candidate gene for malic acid content, designated **MdMa1**, was previously identified in the Ma locus, which is a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for apple fruit acidity located on the linkage group 16.
   - MdMYB21 directly binds to the **MdMa1** promoter and represses its expression. Interestingly, a 2-bp variation in the MdMYB21 promoter region altered its expression and regulation of its target gene, **MdMa1**, expression.
   - The role of **MdMa1** in malate transport from the cytosol to the vacuole and in the regulation of fruit acidity has previously been demonstrated.
