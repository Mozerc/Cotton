## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMa12</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of apple Ma12, a mitochondrial pyrophosphatase pump gene, leads to malic acid accumulation and the upregulation of malate dehydrogenase in tomato and apple calli.
   - The ectopic expression and overexpression of **MdMa12** in “Micro-Tom” tomato and apple calli, respectively, increased the malic acid content.
   - **MdMa12** overexpression increased MdDTC1, MdMa1, and MdMa10 expression levels, which were identified to transport malate.
   - These findings imply that **MdMa12** has important functions related to apple fruit acidity.
