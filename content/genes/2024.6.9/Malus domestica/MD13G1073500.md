## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD13G1073500]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdTCP15</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Histone deacetylase MdHDA6 is an antagonist in regulation of transcription factor **MdTCP15** to promote cold tolerance in apple.
   - MdHDA6 directly interacts with the transcription factor **MdTCP15**. Phenotypic analysis of **MdTCP15** transgenic apple lines and wild types reveals that **MdTCP15** negatively regulates cold tolerance in apples.
   - MdHDA6 can facilitate histone deacetylation of **MdTCP15** and repress the expression of **MdTCP15**, which positively contributes to cold tolerance in apples. Additionally, the transcription factor **MdTCP15** can directly bind to the promoter of the cold-negative regulator gene MdABI1 and activate its expression, and it can also directly bind to the promoter of the cold-positive regulator gene MdCOR47 and repress its expression.
   - Our results demonstrate that histone deacetylase MdHDA6 plays an antagonistic role in the regulation of **MdTCP15**-induced transcriptional activation or repression to positively regulate cold tolerance in apples, revealing a new regulatory mechanism of plant cold response.
   - These results proved that MdWRKY53 interacts with **MdTCP15** in the nucleus, and that GR24 enhances the interaction between MdWRKY53 and **MdTCP15**.
