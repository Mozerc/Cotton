## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD00G040950]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdD1</u>
- **Gene Name:** gamma-thionin protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A gamma-thionin protein from apple, **MdD1**, is required for defence against S-RNase-induced inhibition of pollen tube prior to self/non-self recognition.
   - **MdD1** was shown to bind to the RNase activity sites of S-RNase leading to inhibition of enzymatic activity.
   - **MdD1** acts as a primary defence protein in apple pollen tubes facilitating compatible pollen tube growth in the presence of S-RNase.s
   - **MdD1** directly interacts with the active sites of S-RNase and inhibits its activity following S-RNase entry into the pollen tube.
   - This work provides intriguing insights into an ancient defence mechanism present in apple pollen tubes where **MdD1** likely acts as a primary line of defence to inhibit S-RNase cytotoxicity prior to self/non-self recognition.
