## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdOSC4</u>
- **Gene Name:** oxidosqualene cyclase4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - We used a homology-based approach to identify and functionally characterize two new oxidosqualene cyclases (**MdOSC4** and MdOSC5) and one cytochrome P450 (CYP716A175).
   - **MdOSC4** encodes a multifunctional oxidosqualene cyclase producing an oleanane-type triterpene, putatively identified as germanicol, as well as β-amyrin and lupeol, in the proportion 82 : 14 : 4. MdOSC5 cyclizes 2,3-oxidosqualene into lupeol and β-amyrin at a ratio of 95 : 5.
   - The gene expression of four OSC genes (MdOSC1, MdOSC3, and **MdOSC4** and MdOSC5) as well as the cytochrome P450 was also measured in a collection of 20 contrasting apple cultivars (in terms of triterpene accumulation) and revealed the key roles played by MdOSC1 and MdOSC5 in explaining the concentrations of α-amyrin and lupeol derivatives, respectively.
   - Phylogenetic analysis showed that **MdOSC4** and MdOSC5 lie among the β-amyrin synthases and other mixed functional triterpene synthases and away from identified lupeol synthases.
   - The transient expression of **MdOSC4** in N. benthamiana led to the formation of a mixture of triterpenes dominated by an oleanane-type triterpene, putatively identified as germanicol (82%).
