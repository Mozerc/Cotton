## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000659260]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMYB21</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **MdMYB21** was significantly associated with fruit malic acid content, accounting for ~7.48% of the observed phenotypic variation in the apple germplasm collection. 
   - Analyses of transgenic apple calli, fruits and tomatoes demonstrated that **MdMYB21** negatively regulated malic acid accumulation.
   - **MdMYB21** directly binds to the MdMa1 promoter and represses its expression. Interestingly, a 2-bp variation in the **MdMYB21** promoter region altered its expression and regulation of its target gene, MdMa1, expression. 
   - The results showed that **MdMYB21** negatively regulates malic acid accumulation by directly binding to the promoter of MdMa1 and repressing its expression, resulting in decreased apple acidity.
