## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000133334]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdACS6</u>
- **Gene Name:** ACC synthase6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Apple **MdACS6** Regulates Ethylene Biosynthesis During Fruit Development Involving Ethylene-Responsive Factor.
   - Moreover, the enzyme activity of **MdACS6** was significantly lower than that of MdACS3a and MdACS1, accounting for the low ethylene biosynthesis in young fruits.
   - Overexpression of **MdACS6** (**MdACS6**-OE) by transient assay in apple showed enhanced ethylene production, and MdACS3a was induced in **MdACS6**-OE fruits but not in control fruits.
   - The mechanism through which **MdACS6** regulates the action of MdACS3a was discussed.
