## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000319941]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdTCP46</u>
- **Gene Name:** Teosinte branched1/cycloidea/proliferating transcription factor 46
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The expression of **MdTCP46** was responsive to high light intensity, and under these conditions it promoted anthocyanin biosynthesis by direct interactions with MdMYB1 that enhanced the binding of the latter to its target genes.
   - **MdTCP46** also interacted with a bric-a-brac/tramtrack/broad (BTB) protein, MdBT2, that is responsive to high light intensity, which ubiquitinated **MdTCP46** and mediated its degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway.
   - MdBT2 suppressed the role of **MdTCP46** by inducing its ubiquitination, resulting in subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway.
   - Our results demonstrate that the dynamic regulatory module MdBT2-**MdTCP46**-MdMYB1 plays a key role in modulating anthocyanin biosynthesis at different light intensities in apple, and provides new insights into the post-transcriptional regulation of TCP proteins.
