## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MD08G1209900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdSUT4.1</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose transporter 4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The sucrose transporter **MdSUT4.1** participates in the regulation of fruit sugar accumulation in apple.
   - **MdSUT4.1** is located on chromosomal region harboring a previously reported QTL for sugar content, suggesting that it is a candidate gene for fruit sugar accumulation in apple.
   - Overexpression of **MdSUT4.1** in strawberry and apple callus had an overall negative impact on sugar accumulation, suggesting that it functions to remobilize sugar out of the vacuole.
   - **MdSUT4.1** is involved in the regulation of fruit sugar accumulation in apple. This study is not only helpful for understanding the complex mechanism of fruit sugar accumulation, but it also provides molecular tools for genetic improvement of fruit quality in breeding programs of apple.
