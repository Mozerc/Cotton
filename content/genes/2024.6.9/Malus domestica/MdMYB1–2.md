## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdMYB1–2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The effect of promoter methylation on MdMYB1 expression determines the level of anthocyanin accumulation in skins of two non-red apple cultivars.
   - The MdMYB1 transcription factor gene plays an important role in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin in apple after bag removal, but little is known about how MdMYB1 transcription is regulated.
   - Transcript levels of MdMYB1, the master regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple, increased, and showed a correlation with anthocyanin content in both cultivars after bag removal.
   - **MdMYB1–2** allele cannot confer red pigmentation in apple skins owing to poor expression levels in non-red-skinned cultivars.
   - This indicates that the presence of MdMYB1–1 probably does not explain the formation of red skins in ‘Granny Smith’ fruits after bag removal.
