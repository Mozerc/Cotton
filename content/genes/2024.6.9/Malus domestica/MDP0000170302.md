## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [MDP0000170302]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MdABCF</u>
- **Gene Name:** ABC transporter family F protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Malus domestica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Apple **MdABCF** assists in the transportation of S-RNase into pollen tubes.
   - We show here that the apple (Malus domestica) **MdABCF** protein, which belongs to group F of the ABC transporter family, assists in transportation of S-RNase into the pollen tube.
   - **MdABCF** is located in the pollen tube membrane and interacts with S-RNase. S-RNase was unable to enter the pollen tube when **MdABCF** was silenced by antisense oligonucleotide transfection.
   - Our results show that **MdABCF** assists in transportation of either self or non-self S-RNase into the pollen tube. Moreover, **MdABCF** coordinates with the cytoskeleton to transport S-RNase. Blockage of S-RNase transport disrupts self-incompatibility in this system.
