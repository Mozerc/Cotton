## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaGT2</u>
- **Gene Name:** UDP-glucose glucosyltransferase 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **FaGT2**: a multifunctional enzyme from strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruits involved in the metabolism of natural and xenobiotic compounds.
   - Fragaria × ananassa UDP-glucose:cinnamate glucosyltransferase (**FaGT2**) catalyzes the formation of cinnamic acid and p-coumaric acid glucose esters during strawberry fruit ripening.
   - **FaGT2** was also capable of efficiently converting xenobiotic substances like the herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and the herbicide analogue 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid.
   - The results suggest that **FaGT2** is involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics in accordance to its induction by oxidative stress.
