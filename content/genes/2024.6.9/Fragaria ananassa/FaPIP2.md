## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaPIP2|1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Water channel protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **FaPIP2|1**|**FaPIP2|1**, an aquaporin subtype of PIP2 was cloned and its functional characterization in Xenopus oocytes determined.
   - The **FaPIP2|1**|**FaPIP2|1** gene encodes a water channel with high water permeability (Pf) that is regulated by cytosolic pH.
   - **FaPIP2|1**|**FaPIP2|1** is a water channel which promotes very high membrane Pf, and is unable to transport some solutes already described for other plant aquaporins: urea, ammonia, boric acid or glycerol.
   - Although it cannot be dismissed that **FaPIP2|1**|**FaPIP2|1** might be involved in the transport of other non-tested solutes or even ions, this aquaporin seems to be mainly involved in water transport.
