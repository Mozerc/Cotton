## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaPE1</u>
- **Gene Name:** pectinesterase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Concerning hormone regulation, auxin treatment increased **FaPE1** mRNA levels in green fruit, whereas exogenous ethylene decreased **FaPE1** mRNA levels in ripe and senescing fruits.
   - It is proposed that this repression of **FaPE1** expression could be involved in textural changes occurring during fruit senescence.
   - Demethylation of oligogalacturonides by **FaPE1** in the fruits of the wild strawberry Fragaria vesca triggers metabolic and transcriptional changes associated with defence and development of the fruit.
   - When taken together these results show that in cultivated F. ananassa **FaPE1** participates in the de-esterification of pectins and the generation of partially demethylated OGAs, which might reinforce the plant defence system and play an active role in fruit development.
