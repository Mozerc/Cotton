## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaPG2</u>
- **Gene Name:** polygalacturonase-like protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Polygalacturonase (PG) activity is low during this process, but two ripening-related PG genes, FaPG1 and **FaPG2**, have been cloned.
   - Ripened fruits from the four selected lines showed a 90% to 95% decrease in FaPG1 transcript abundance, whereas the level of **FaPG2** was not significantly altered.
   - Expression of FaPG1 and **FaPG2** genes, in relative units, and evolution of fruit firmness during fruit development. Bars represent means Â± SD of three independent RNA quantifications.
   - These results show that the expression of FaPG1 and **FaPG2** genes is negatively regulated by auxin.
