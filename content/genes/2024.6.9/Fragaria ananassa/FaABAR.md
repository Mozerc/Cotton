## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaABAR</u>
- **Gene Name:** ABA receptor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Strawberry **FaABAR** is an ABA receptor that serves an inducer of fruit ripening, and identification of **FaABAR**-interacting proteins can therefore provide insights into the action of ABA in ripening.
   - Similar to the **FaABAR**-VIGS fruit, a feedback-regulatory increase in ABA content in the FaRIPK1-VIGS fruit was also found.
   - Based on these results, we propose that **FaABAR**, FaRIPK, and FaABI4 synergistically regulate strawberry fruit ripening through a linear link.
   - The synergistic action of FaRIPK1 with **FaABAR** in regulation of strawberry fruit ripening is discussed.
