## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaβGal4</u>
- **Gene Name:** β-galactosidase 14
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Antisense down-regulation of the strawberry β-galactosidase gene **FaβGal4** increases cell wall galactose levels and reduces fruit softening.
   - A putative β-galactosidase gene, **FaβGal4**, has been identified using a custom-made oligonucleotide-based strawberry microarray platform.
   - **FaβGal4** was expressed mainly in the receptacle during fruit ripening, and was positively regulated by abscisic acid and negatively regulated by auxins.
   - These results suggest that **FaβGal4** participates in the solubilization of covalently bound pectins during ripening, reducing strawberry fruit firmness.
