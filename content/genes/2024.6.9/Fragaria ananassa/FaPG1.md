## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaPG1</u>
- **Gene Name:** putative endo-polygalacturonase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Antisense Down-Regulation of the **FaPG1** Gene Reveals an Unexpected Central Role for Polygalacturonase in Strawberry Fruit Softening.
   - The strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa ‘Chandler’) fruit undergoes a fast softening during ripening. Polygalacturonase (PG) activity is low during this process, but two ripening-related PG genes, **FaPG1** and FaPG2, have been cloned.
   - Ripened fruits from the four selected lines showed a 90% to 95% decrease in **FaPG1** transcript abundance, whereas the level of FaPG2 was not significantly altered.
   - These results indicate that **FaPG1** plays a central role in strawberry softening.
