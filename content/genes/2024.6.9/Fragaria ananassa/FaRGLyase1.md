## Gene Details:

- **Gene Name:** rhamnogalacturonate lyase 1 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The strawberry (Fragaria√óananassa) fruit-specific rhamnogalacturonate lyase 1 (**FaRGLyase1**) gene encodes an enzyme involved in the degradation of cell-wall middle lamellae.
   - Using a custom-made oligonucleotide-based strawberry microarray platform, a putative rhamnogalacturonate lyase gene (**FaRGLyase1**) was identified. Bioinformatic analysis of the **FaRGLyase1** sequence allowed the identification of a conserved rhamnogalacturonate lyase domain, which was also present in other putative RGlyase sequences deposited in the databases.
   - Expression of **FaRGLyase1** occurred mainly in the receptacle, concurrently with ripening, and it was positively regulated by abscisic acid and negatively by auxins.
   - **FaRGLyase1** gene expression was transiently silenced by injecting live Agrobacterium cells harbouring RNA interference constructs into fruit receptacles. Light and electron microscopy analyses of these transiently silenced fruits revealed that this gene is involved in the degradation of pectins present in the middle lamella region between parenchymatic cells.
   - The results showed that **FaRGLyase1** could play an important role in the fruit ripening-related softening process that reduces strawberry firmness and post-harvest life.
