## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [FvH4_5g32460]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaMYB123</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3 MYB transcription factor 123
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Fragaria ananassa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **FaMYB123** interacts with FabHLH3 to regulate the late steps of anthocyanin and flavonol biosynthesis during ripening.
   - **FaMYB123** and FabHLH3 were found to interact and to be involved in the transcriptional activation of FaMT1, a gene responsible for the malonylation of anthocyanin components during ripening.
   - **FaMYB123** is strongly expressed in receptacles and hormonally regulated throughout strawberry fruit growth and ripening.
   - **FaMYB123**, together with FaMYB10, regulates the anthocyanin pathway in strawberry.
