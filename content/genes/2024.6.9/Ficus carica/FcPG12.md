## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FcPG12</u>
- **Gene Name:** Polygalacturonases 12
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Ficus carica*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Polygalacturonase gene family analysis identifies **FcPG12** as a key player in fig (Ficus carica L.) fruit softening.
   - **FcPG12**, a member of the tandem repeat cluster on chromosome 4, was selected for further analyses due to its sharp increment in transcript abundance during fruit softening and its response to ethephon treatment.
   - Transient overexpression of **FcPG12** led to decreased fig fruit firmness and increased PG enzyme activity in the tissue. 
   - Transient overexpression of FcERF5 upregulated **FcPG12** expression, thereby increasing PG activity and fruit softening.
