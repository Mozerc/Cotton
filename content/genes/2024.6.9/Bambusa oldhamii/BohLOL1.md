## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BohLOL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** LSD-one-like 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Bambusa oldhamii*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A cDNA, **BohLOL1**, encoding a protein containing three zf-LSD1 (zinc finger-Lesions Simulating Disease resistance 1) domains was cloned from growing bamboo (Bambusa oldhamii) shoots.
   - A phylogenetic analysis revealed that **BohLOL1** is a homolog of Arabidopsis LSD1 and LOL1 (LSD-one-like 1), which have been reported to act antagonistically in controlling cell death via the maintenance of reactive oxygen species homeostasis.
   - The results suggest that **BohLOL1** participates in bamboo growth and in the response to biotic stress. The DNA-binding assays and subcellular localization studies demonstrated that **BohLOL1** is a nuclear DNA-binding protein. **BohLOL1** might function through protein-DNA interactions and thus affect the expression of its target genes. 
   - The results of this study extend the role of plant LSD1 and LOL1 proteins from the regulation of cell death to cell growth. The growth-dependent up-regulation of **BohLOL1** expression, which uniquely occurs in growing bamboo, might be one of the critical factors that contribute to the rapid growth of this remarkable plant.
