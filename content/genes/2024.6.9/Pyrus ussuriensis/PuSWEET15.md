## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PuSWEET15</u>
- **Gene Name:** Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporter
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus ussuriensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **PuSWEET15** in NG pear fruit increased Suc content, while silencing of **PuSWEET15** in BNG fruit decreased Suc content.
   - The WRKY transcription factor PuWRKY31 was also expressed more highly in BNG fruit than in NG fruit, and we found that PuWRKY31 bound to the **PuSWEET15** promoter and induced its transcription.
   - Determined that a WRKY transcription factor, PuWRKY31, which was also expressed at higher levels in BNG fruit, bound to the **PuSWEET15** promoter and upregulated its expression.
