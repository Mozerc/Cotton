## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsLOB1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Lateral organ boundaries 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - PthA, a transcriptional activator-like (TAL) effector, directs the expression of the canker susceptibility gene **CsLOB1**.
   - Subcellular localization analysis of **CsLOB1** protein in citrus protoplast revealed that **CsLOB1** is primarily localized in the nucleus.
   - When **CsLOB1**-GR-transgenic Duncan grapefruit leaves were inoculated with Xcc306Î”pthA4 and treated with DEX, typical canker symptoms, including hypertrophy, hyperplasia and water soaking symptoms, were observed on DEX-treated transgenic plant leaves, but not on mock-treated plants.
   - Identified putative targets of **CsLOB1** via bioinformatic and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Cs2g20600, which encodes a zinc finger C3HC4-type RING finger protein, has been identified to be a direct target of **CsLOB1**.
