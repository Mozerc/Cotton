## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MsSPSA</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose phosphate synthase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Nodule-enhanced expression of a sucrose phosphate synthase gene member (**MsSPSA**) has a role in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the nodules of alfalfa.
   - While **MsSPSA** showed nodule-enhanced expression, both MsSPSB genes exhibited leaf-enhanced expression. Alfalfa leaf and nodule SPS enzymes showed differences in chromatographic and electrophoretic migration and differences in V max and allosteric regulation.
   - The expression of the **MsSPSA** gene in the nodules, however, does not seem to be regulated by N2 fixation or other factors caused by N defficiency.
   - **MsSPSA** transcript levels in the nodules are not affected by the N2 fixing ability of the symbiont.
