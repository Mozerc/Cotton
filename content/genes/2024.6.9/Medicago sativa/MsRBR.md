## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MsRBR</u>
- **Gene Name:** Retinoblastoma-related protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago sativa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Roscovitine treatment abolished the activity of alfalfa MsCDKA1|1 and MsCDKB2|1, and the phospho-**MsRBR** protein level was significantly decreased in the treated cells.
   - Colchicine block increased the detected levels of both forms of **MsRBR** protein. Reduced levels of the **MsRBR** protein in cells at stationary phase or grown in hormone-free medium can be a sign of the division-dependent presence of plant RBR proteins.
   - Immunolocalization of the phospho-**MsRBR** protein indicated spots of variable number and size in the labelled interphase nuclei and high signal intensity of nuclear granules in prophase.
   - Structures similar to phospho-**MsRBR** proteins cannot be recognized in later mitotic phases. Based on the presented western blot and immunolocalization data, the possible involvement of RBR proteins in G2/M phase regulation in plant cells is discussed.
