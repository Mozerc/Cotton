## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BjCET4</u>
- **Gene Name:** cation-efflux transporter4
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica juncea*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The functional characterization of two B. juncea cation-efflux family proteins BjCET3 and **BjCET4** is reported here. The two proteins are closely related to each other in amino acid sequence, and are members of Group III of the cation-efflux transporters.
   - Heterologous expression of BjCET3 and **BjCET4** in yeast confirmed their functions in exporting Zn, and possibly Cd, Co, and Ni.
   - Transformed **BjCET4** tobacco plants showed significantly enhanced shoot biomass production with markedly decreased shoot Cd content.
   - Suggesting that BjCET3 and **BjCET4** may play roles in several stress conditions, roles which appear to be different from those of previous characterized cation-efflux transporters, for example, AtMTP1, BjCET2, and BjMTP1.
