## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BjCdR15</u>
- **Gene Name:** BZIP transcription factor15
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica juncea*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The Brassica juncea **BjCdR15**, an ortholog of Arabidopsis TGA3, is a regulator of cadmium uptake, transport and accumulation in shoots and confers cadmium tolerance in transgenic plants.
   - **BjCdR15** expression was detected mainly in the epidermis and vascular system of cadmium-treated plants, and increased in roots and leaves after cadmium treatment.
   - The overexpression of **BjCdR15** in Arabidopsis and tobacco enhanced cadmium tolerance: overexpressing plants showed high cadmium accumulation in shoots.
   - **BjCdR15**/TGA3 regulated the synthesis of phytochelatin synthase and the expression of several metal transporters.
   - The results indicate that **BjCdR15**/TGA3 transcription factors play a crucial role in the regulation of cadmium uptake by roots and in its long-distance root to shoot transport. **BjCdR15**/TGA3 may thus be considered as useful candidates for potential biotechnological applications in the phytoextraction of cadmium from polluted soils.
