## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PrCCoAOMT</u>
- **Gene Name:** caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pinus radiata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A cDNA clone encoding the lignin-related enzyme caffeoylâ€ƒCoA 3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) was isolated from a Pinus radiata cDNA library derived from differentiating xylem.
   - Suppression of **PrCCoAOMT** expression in P. radiata tracheary element cultures affected lignin content and composition, resulting in a lignin polymer containing p-hydroxyphenyl (H), catechyl (C) and guaiacyl (G) units.
   - Correspondingly, the proportion of H-type lignin in **PrCCoAOMT**-deficient transgenic lines increased, resulting in up to a 10-fold increase in the H/G ratio relative to untransformed controls. 2D-NMR spectra revealed that **PrCCoAOMT** suppression resulted in formation of benzodioxanes in the lignin polymer.
   - Comparison of the 2D-NMR spectra from **PrCCoAOMT**-RNAi lines and synthetic lignins identified caffeyl alcohol as the new lignin constituent in **PrCCoAOMT**-deficient lines. The incorporation of caffeyl alcohol into lignin created a polymer containing catechyl units, a lignin type that has not been previously identified in recombinant lignin studies.
