## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnA7.SUT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose transporter1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - This paper reports the isolation of **BnA7.SUT1** alleles and their promoters and their association with yield-related traits.
   - The **BnA7.SUT1** protein exhibited typical SUT features and showed high amino acid homology with related species.
   - SNPs at other **BnA7.SUT1** sites were also significantly associated with at least one of six yield-related traits: EFB, SP, number of seeds per silique, seed yield per plant, block yield, and TSW. 
   - Expression levels varied over various tissue/organs at the seed-filling stage, and **BnA7.SUT1** expression positively correlated with EFB and TSW.
