## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [BnaA07G0307300ZS]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnaSSA07.CRC</u>
- **Gene Name:** CRABS CLAW
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - BnaCRCs with domestication preference positively correlate with the seed-setting rate of canola.
   - Gene analyses showed that a pair of CRABS CLAW (CRC) homeologous genes at BnaSSA07 and BnaSSC06 were associated with the development of carpel and nectary. **BnaSSA07.CRC** and BnaSSC06.CRC candidate genes were found to be expressed in flower organs only, with significant differences in their expression in the pistils of the near-isogenic lines.
   - **BnaSSA07.CRC** and BnaSSC06.CRC were the most likely target genes reducing SS in sd mutants in the segregated populations and were, therefore, selected for gene validation.
