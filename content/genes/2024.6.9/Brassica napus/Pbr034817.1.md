## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Pbr034817.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbrROP2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - PbrROP1/**PbrROP2**-elicited imbalance of cellulose deposition is mediated by a CrRLK1L-ROPGEF module in the pollen tube of Pyrus.
   - PbrROP1 and **PbrROP2** were the downstream targets of PbrCrRLK1L13-PbrGEF8. When we knocked down the expression of PbrCrRLK1L13, PbrGEF8, or PbrROP1/2, the balance of cellulose deposition in the pollen tube wall was disrupted.
   - Demonstrating that PbrROP1 and **PbrROP2** could regulate pear pollen tube growth.
   - During pear pollen tube elongation, PbrCrRLK1L13 acted as a surface regulator of the PbrROP1 and **PbrROP2** signaling pathway via PbrGEF8 to affect the balance of cellulose deposition and regulate pear pollen tube growth.
