## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PbLAC4-like</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PbLAC4-like**, activated by PbMYB26, related to the degradation of anthocyanin during color fading in pear.
   - The expression pattern of **PbLAC4-like** was negatively correlated with the content of anthocyanin during the color fading process of pear leaves, petals and receptacles.
   - These results suggested that **PbLAC4-like** possibly played an important role in inhibiting the accumulation of anthocyanin during color fading progress.
   - These results showed that **PbLAC4-like**, activated by PbMYB26, promoted the degradation of anthocyanin in pear.
