## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnPME</u>
- **Gene Name:** pectinmethylesterase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **BnPME** is progressively induced after microspore reprogramming to embryogenesis, correlating with pectin de-esterification and cell differentiation in Brassica napus.
   - The results showed that cell differentiation at advanced developmental stages involved induction of **BnPME** expression and pectin de-esterification, processes that were also detected in zygotic embryos, providing additional evidence that microspore embryogenesis mimics zygotic embryogenesis.
   - By contrast, early microspore embryogenesis, totipotency and proliferation were associated with low expression of **BnPME** and high levels of esterified pectins.
   - The results showed an increase in **BnPME** expression with embryogenesis progression, and the developmental regulation of the methylesterification status of pectins during microspore embryogenesis and gametophytic development.
