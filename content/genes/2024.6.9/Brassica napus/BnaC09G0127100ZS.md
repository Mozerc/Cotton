## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [BnaC09G0127100ZS]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnaC9.CKX2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The transcription factor BnaWRKY10 regulates cytokinin dehydrogenase BnaCKX2 to control cytokinin distribution and seed size in Brassica napus.
   - The quadruple mutants of the four BnaCKX2 homologs were generated. Endogenous CKs were increased in the seeds of the BnaCKX2 quadruple mutants, resulting in a significantly reduced seed size.
   - The TFs BnaWRKY10s were co-expressed with BnaCKX2s| BnaWRKY10s positively regulated seed size by promoting the expression of BnaCKX2s.
   - Overall, the study reveals the distribution of CKs in B. napus tissues, and shows that BnaWRKY10-mediated BnaCKX2 expression is essential for seed size regulation, providing promising targets for oil crop improvement.
