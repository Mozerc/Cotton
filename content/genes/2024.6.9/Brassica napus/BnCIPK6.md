## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnCIPK6</u>
- **Gene Name:** CBL-interacting protein kinase 6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) gene, **BnCIPK6**, was isolated in Brassica napus. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, 27 interaction partners (including BnCBL1) of **BnCIPK6** were identified in Brassica napus.
   - Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with over-expressing **BnCIPK6**, its activated form **BnCIPK6**M, and BnCBL1 enhanced high salinity and low phosphate tolerance, suggesting that the functional interaction of BnCBL1 and **BnCIPK6** may be important for the high salinity and phosphorous deficiency signalling pathways.
   - Expressions of **BnCIPK6** and BnCBL1 were significantly up-regulated by salt and osmotic stresses, phosphorous starvation, and abscisic acid (ABA).
   - Over-expression of **BnCIPK6** in Arabidopsis cipk6 mutant completely rescued the low-phosphate-sensitive and ABA-insensitive phenotypes of this mutant, further suggesting that **BnCIPK6** is involved in the plant response to high-salinity, phosphorous deficiency, and ABA signalling.
