## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Potri.004G095100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PaC3H17</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [poplar genome (v.3.1)]()
- **Species:** *Populus alba × Populus glandulosa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Dual regulation of xylem formation by an auxin-mediated **PaC3H17**-PaMYB199 module in Populus.
   - **PaC3H17** and its target PaMYB199 were found to be predominantly expressed in the vascular cambium and developing secondary xylem in Populus stems and play opposite roles in controlling cambial cell proliferation and secondary cell wall thickening through an overlapping pathway.
   - **PaC3H17** interacts with PaMYB199 to form a complex, attenuating PaMYB199-driven suppression of its xylem targets. 
   - Exogenous auxin application enhances the dual control of the **PaC3H17**-PaMYB199 module during cambium division, thereby promoting secondary cell wall deposition.
   - Dual regulation of xylem formation by an auxin-mediated **PaC3H17**-PaMYB199 module represents a novel regulatory mechanism in Populus, increasing our understanding of the regulatory networks involved in wood formation.
