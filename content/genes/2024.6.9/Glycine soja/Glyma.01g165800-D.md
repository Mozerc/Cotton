## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.01g165800-D]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Rj4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Glycine soja thaumatin-like protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Glycine soja*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **Rj4**, a Gene Controlling Nodulation Specificity in Soybeans, Encodes a Thaumatin-Like Protein But Not the One Previously Reported.
   - **Rj4** is a dominant gene in soybeans (Glycine max) that restricts nodulation by many strains of Bradyrhizobium elkanii. The soybean-B. elkanii symbiosis has a low nitrogen-fixation efficiency, but B. elkanii strains are highly competitive for nodulation| thus, cultivars harboring an **Rj4** allele are considered favorable.
   - Instead, we provide convincing evidence that **Rj4** is Glyma.01g165800-D, a duplicated and unique version of Glyma.01g165800, that has evolved the ability to control symbiotic specificity.
   - CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Knockout Revealed That Glyma.01G165800-D But Not Glyma.01G165800 Is Required for **Rj4**-Mediated Nodulation Restriction.
