## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SrDXS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Stevia rebaudiana*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **SrDXS1** and SrKAH enhances steviol glycosides content in transgenic Stevia plants.
   - Overexpressed the Stevia 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1 (**SrDXS1**) and kaurenoic acid hydroxylase (SrKAH), both of which are required for SGs biosynthesis.
   - Compared to control plants, the total SGs content in **SrDXS1**- and SrKAH-overexpressing transgenic lines were enhanced by up to 42–54% and 67–88%, respectively, showing a positive correlation with the expression levels of **SrDXS1** and SrKAH.
   - These results suggest that the overexpression of **SrDXS1** in Stevia leads to a proportional increase in each SG.
