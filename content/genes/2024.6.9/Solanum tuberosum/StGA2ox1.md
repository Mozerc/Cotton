## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StGA2ox1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Gibberellin 2-oxidase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **StGA2ox1** is induced prior to stolon swelling and controls GA levels during potato tuber development.
   - **StGA2ox1** is upregulated during the early stages of potato tuber development prior to visible swelling and is predominantly expressed in the subapical region of the stolon and growing tuber.
   - Transgenic plants with reduced expression levels of **StGA2ox1** showed normal plant growth, an altered stolon swelling phenotype and delayed in vitro tuberization.
   - Over-expression and suppression of **StGA2ox1** expression results in altered growth characteristics and tuber morphology.
   - We propose a role for **StGA2ox1** in early tuber initiation by modifying GA levels in the subapical stolon region at the onset of tuberization, thereby facilitating normal tuber development and growth.
