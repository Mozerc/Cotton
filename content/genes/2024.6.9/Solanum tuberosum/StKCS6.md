## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StKCS6</u>
- **Gene Name:** 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Silencing of **StKCS6** in potato periderm leads to reduced chain lengths of suberin and wax compounds and increased peridermal transpiration.
   - This gene, called **StKCS6**, was stably silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) in potato. Analysis of the chemical composition of silenced potato tuber periderms indicated that **StKCS6** down-regulation has a significant and fairly specific effect on the chain length distribution of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and derivatives, occurring in the suberin polymer and peridermal wax.
   - **StKCS6** is preferentially involved in the formation of suberin and wax lipidic monomers with chain lengths of C28 and higher.
   - Our results convincingly show that **StKCS6** is involved in both suberin and wax biosynthesis and that a reduction of the monomeric carbon chain lengths leads to increased rates of peridermal transpiration.
