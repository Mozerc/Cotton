## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StABF1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ABRE binding factor1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of **StABF1**, a stress-responsive bZIP transcription factor from Solanum tuberosum L. that is phosphorylated by StCDPK2 in vitro.
   - **StABF1** is able to bind to the ABRE in vitro. **StABF1** gene is induced in response to ABA, drought, salt stress and cold, suggesting that it might be a key regulator of ABA-dependent stress signaling pathways in cultivated potato. 
   - **StABF1** is phosphorylated in response to ABA and salt stress in a calcium-dependent manner, and we have identified a potato CDPK isoform (StCDPK2) that phosphorylates **StABF1** in vitro.
   - **StABF1** expression is increased during tuber development and by tuber-inducing conditions (high sucrose/nitrogen ratio) in leaves. We also found that **StABF1** calcium-dependent phosphorylation is stimulated by tuber-inducing conditions and inhibited by gibberellic acid, which inhibits tuberization.
