## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StInvInh2A</u>
- **Gene Name:** Shepody putative invertase inhibitor
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - StInvInh2 as an inhibitor of StvacINV1 regulates the cold-induced sweetening of potato tubers by specifically capping vacuolar invertase activity.
   - In our previous research, two putative inhibitors (**StInvInh2A** and StInvInh2B) of StvacINV1 were implied to be involved in potato CIS. 
   - Here, we further reported that **StInvInh2A** and StInvInh2B had similar function that specifically inhibited StvacINV1 activity in potatoes.
   - The results also demonstrated that depression of StvacINV1 activity through overexpression of **StInvInh2A** and StInvInh2B weakened accumulation of RS and acrylamide in cold-stored tubers and consequently improved the chip quality.
   - The present research strongly suggest that both **StInvInh2A** and StInvInh2B function as inhibitors of StvacINV1 and play similar roles in regulating potato CIS by capping StvacINV1 activity. These inhibitors could be novel genetic resources applicable for improving quality of potato processing products.
