## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [PGSC0003DMG400014879]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>StPIP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Spud DB (http://solanaceae.plantbiology.msu.edu/)]()
- **Species:** *Solanum tuberosum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **StPIP1**, a PAMP-induced peptide in potato, elicits plant defenses and is associated with disease symptom severity in a compatible interaction with Potato virus Y.
   - We show that exogenous application of synthetic **StPIP1** to potato leaves and nodes increased the production of reactive oxygen species and the expression of plant defense-related genes, revealing that **StPIP1** triggers early defense responses.
   - Exogenous application of **StPIP1** induces ROS production and expression of defense-related genes in potato.
   - Our results reveal a role for **StPIP1** in eliciting plant defense responses and in regulating plant antiviral immunity.
