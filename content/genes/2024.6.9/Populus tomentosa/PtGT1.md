## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PtGT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** putative glycosyltransferase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Populus tomentosa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Over-expression of a putative poplar glycosyltransferase gene, **PtGT1**, in tobacco increases lignin content and causes early flowering.
   - The **PtGT1** gene was expressed in poplar stems and leaves, with a particularly high expression level in elongating stems.
   - The ectopic over-expression of **PtGT1** in tobacco resulted in an early flowering phenotype.
   - hese findings offer a possible starting point towards better understanding of the function of poplar **PtGT1**, and provide a novel strategy for lignin engineering and flowering control in plants through the genetic manipulation of a poplar glycosyltransferase gene.
