## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhERS2</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene receptor2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Petunia hybrida*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of two ethylene receptors PhERS1 and PhETR2 from petunia: PhETR2 regulates timing of anther dehiscence.
   - High levels of both PhERS1 and PhETR2 transcripts were detectable in petunia leaves treated with exogenous ethylene, while only PhETR2 mRNA increased after wounding and salt treatment.
   - Transgenic petunia plants with decreased PhERS1 expression caused by double-stranded RNA inhibition (dsRNAi) exhibited the wild-type phenotype, but showed increased mRNA levels of PhETR2.
   - This suggests functional compensation between the two genes. Antisense suppression of PhETR2 in petunia led to stomium degeneration and anther dehiscence before anthesis, indicating that PhETR2 regulates synchronization of anther dehiscence with flower opening.
