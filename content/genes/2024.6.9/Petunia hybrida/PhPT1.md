## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhPT1|PhPht1|1</u>
- **Gene Name:** phosphate transporter1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Petunia hybrida*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Ethylene regulates phosphorus remobilization and expression of a phosphate transporter (**PhPT1|PhPht1|1**) during petunia corolla senescence.
   - A high-affinity phosphate transporter, **PhPT1|PhPht1|1** (**PhPT1|PhPht1|1**|**PhPT1|PhPht1|1**), was cloned from senescing petunia corollas by RT-PCR. **PhPT1|PhPht1|1** expression was up-regulated during MD corolla senescence and a much smaller increase was detected during the senescence of etr**PhPT1|PhPht1|1**-**PhPT1|PhPht1|1** petunia corollas.
   - **PhPT1|PhPht1|1** mRNA levels showed a rapid increase in detached corollas (treated at **PhPT1|PhPht1|1** d after flower opening) following treatment with low levels of ethylene (0.**PhPT1|PhPht1|1** Î¼l l-**PhPT1|PhPht1|1**). Transcripts accumulated in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, indicating that **PhPT1|PhPht1|1** is a primary ethylene response gene.
   - **PhPT1|PhPht1|1** is a putative phosphate transporter that may function in Pi translocation during senescence.
