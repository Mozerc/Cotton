## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhERS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene receptor1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Petunia hybrida*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Characterization of two ethylene receptors **PhERS1** and PhETR2 from petunia: PhETR2 regulates timing of anther dehiscence.
   - Genomic Southern blot analysis revealed that small families of **PhERS1**-related and PhETR2-related genes exist in petunia. **PhERS1** and PhETR2 are constitutively expressed in stem, flower bud, flower, and roots, with a very low level in leaves.
   - Transgenic petunia plants with decreased **PhERS1** expression caused by double-stranded RNA inhibition (dsRNAi) exhibited the wild-type phenotype, but showed increased mRNA levels of PhETR2.
   - Arabidopsis plants transformed with a site-mutated **PhERS1** in the potential ethylene-binding domain exhibited partial ethylene insensitivity, suggesting that the function of this domain is conserved in the two species.
