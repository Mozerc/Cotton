## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhACO1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Petunia hybrida*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PhACO1** was subsequently edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and its role in ethylene production was investigated.
   - **PhACO1**-edited T0 mutant lines, regardless of mutant type (homozygous or monoallelic), exhibited significantly reduced ethylene production and enhanced flower longevity compared with wild-type. Flower longevity and the reduction in ethylene production were observed to be stronger in homozygous plants than in their monoallelic counterparts. 
   - The **PhACO1** gene, which is highly expressed during the flowering period, was edited with the CRISPR/Cas9 system in order to generate **PhACO1**-edited mutants that exhibited lower ethylene production and subsequently greater flower longevity.
   - Overall, this study increases the understanding of the role of **PhACO1** in petunia flower longevity and also points to the CRISPR/Cas9 system being a powerful tool in the improvement of floricultural quality.
   - PhGRL2 protein, interacting with **PhACO1**, is involved in flower senescence in the petunia.
