## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PhERF2</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene-responsive-element-binding factor 2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Petunia hybrida*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A petunia ethylene-responsive element binding factor, **PhERF2**, plays an important role in antiviral RNA silencing.
   - An ethylene-responsive element binding factor, **PhERF2**, is induced by Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) infection. Inclusion of a **PhERF2** fragment in a TRV silencing construct containing reporter fragments of phytoene desaturase (PDS) or chalcone synthase (CHS) substantially impaired silencing efficiency of both the PDS and CHS reporters.
   - Photobleaching in response to infiltration with the TRV-PhPDS construct was enhanced in plants overexpressing **PhERF2**.
   - Interestingly, growth and development of **PhERF2**-RNAi lines were substantially slower, whereas the overexpressing lines were more vigorous than the controls. Taken together, our results indicate that **PhERF2** functions as a positive regulator in antiviral RNA silencing.
