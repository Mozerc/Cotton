## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Pbr013092.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PyWRKY26</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pyrus communis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **PyWRKY26** and PybHLH3 cotargeted the PyMYB114 promoter to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis and transport in red-skinned pears.
   - The TFs PyWRKY31 and **PyWRKY26** were screened as candidate genes for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis by transcriptome data and bioinformatics analysis.
   - Evaluating the correlation of **PyWRKY26**/PyWRKY31 with anthocyanin accumulation and other factors regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in pears.
   - These results showed that the interaction of **PyWRKY26** and PybHLH3 could cotarget the PyMYB114 promoter, which resulted in anthocyanin accumulation in red-skinned pear. This study further strengthened the understanding of the regulatory mechanism of anthocyanin accumulation and contributed to improving the appearance of red-skinned pears.
