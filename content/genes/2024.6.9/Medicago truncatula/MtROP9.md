## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtROP9</u>
- **Gene Name:** small G-protein ROP9
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Silencing of the Rac1 GTPase **MtROP9** in Medicago truncatula Stimulates Early Mycorrhizal and Oomycete Root Colonizations But Negatively Affects Rhizobial Infection.
   - Composite M. truncatula plants (**MtROP9**i) whose roots have been transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes carrying the RNA interference vector were generated and infected with the symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Glomus intraradices and the rhizobial bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti as well as with the pathogenic oomycete Aphanomyces euteiches.
   - **MtROP9**i transgenic lines showed a clear growth-reduced phenotype and revealed neither ROS generation nor **MtROP9** and MtRBOH gene expression after microbial infection.
   - **MtROP9** knockdown clearly promoted mycorrhizal and A. euteiches early hyphal root colonization, while rhizobial infection was clearly impaired.
   - S. meliloti nodulation factor treatments of **MtROP9**i led to deformed root hairs showing progressed swelling of its upper regions or even of the entire root hair and spontaneous constrictions but reduced branching effects occurring only at swollen root hairs. These results suggest a key role of Rac1 GTPase **MtROP9** in ROS-mediated early infection signaling.
