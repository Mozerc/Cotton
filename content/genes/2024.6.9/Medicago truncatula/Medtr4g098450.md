## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Medtr4g098450]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtAHL1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Whereas mutation of NCR169 arrested bacteroid development at a late stage, the absence of **MtAHL1** or MtAHL2 completely blocked bacteroid differentiation indicating that they also regulate other NCR genes required for the development of nitrogen-fixing nodules.
   - Identified two closely related transcription factors, **MtAHL1** and MtAHL2, that bound to the previously recognized motif 4 in the NCR169 promoter. 
   - The absence of either of the **MtAHL1** and MtAHL2 transcription factors abolished the formation of nitrogen-fixing nodules in M. truncatula demonstrating their importance in symbiosis. 
   - These phenotypes and their ability to induce NCR genes of different expression patterns imply that **MtAHL1** and MtAHL2 play crucial roles in regulation of other NCR genes required for full bacteroid differentiation and the development of fully functioning nitrogen-fixing nodules.
