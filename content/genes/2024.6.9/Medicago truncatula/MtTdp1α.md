## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>MtTdp1α</u>
- **Gene Name:** tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - An intron-spliced hairpin RNA approach was used for the targeted silencing of the **MtTdp1α** gene encoding the αisoform of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 in Medicago truncatula Gaertn.
   - RNA-Seq analysis, carried out in the **MtTdp1α**-depleted plants, revealed different levels of transcriptional modulation (up- and down-regulation, alternative splicing, activation of alternative promoter) in genes involved in DNA damage sensing, DNA repair, and chromatin remodelling.
   - It is suggested that the **MtTdp1α** gene has new, previously undetected roles in maintaining genome integrity. Up-regulation of senescence-associated genes and telomere shortening were observed.
   - Impaired ribosome biogenesis indicated that the **MtTdp1α** gene is required for the nucleolar function.In agreement with the RNA-Seq data, transmission electron microscopy detected an altered nucleolar architecture in the **MtTdp1α**-depleted cells.
