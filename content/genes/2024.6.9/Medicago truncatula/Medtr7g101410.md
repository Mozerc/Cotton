## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Medtr7g101410]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>EIN2</u>
- **Gene Name:** ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Medicago truncatula*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Consistent with this observation, the **EIN2** mutation rescues the previously described effects of ethylene overproduction in mature phytochrome-deficient plants.
   - This exposes **EIN2** to proteolytic cleavage, and a C-terminal fragment is released to enter the nucleus, where it inhibits degradation of the EIN3/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 transcription factors and promotes the expression of ethylene-responsive genes.
   - Minimal effects of **EIN2** on seedling development in darkness or high-irradiance white light show that ethylene is not limiting for development under these conditions.
   - These observations show that the **EIN2** mutation enhances and the ethylene application inhibits leaf expansion in seedlings where photoreceptor activation is subsaturating and suggest that the ethylene signaling pathway may moderate or oppose the effects of light at one or more points downstream of both phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptors.
