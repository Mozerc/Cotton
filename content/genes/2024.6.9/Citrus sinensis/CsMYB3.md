## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsMYB3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Citrus sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CsMYB3** and CsRuby1 form an ‘Activator-and-Repressor’ Loop for the Regulation of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Citrus.
   - **CsMYB3** was expressed in anthocyanin-pigmented tissues, and the expression was closely associated with that of Ruby1, which is a key anthocyanin activator. 
   - Overexpression of **CsMYB3** in Arabidopsis resulted in a decrease in anthocyanins under nitrogen stress. Overexpression of **CsMYB3** in the background of CsRuby1-overexpressing strawberry and Arabidopsis reduced the anthocyanin accumulation level.
   - This study shows that **CsMYB3** plays a repressor role in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and proposes an ‘activator-and-repressor’ loop model constituted by CsRuby1 and **CsMYB3** in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in citrus.
