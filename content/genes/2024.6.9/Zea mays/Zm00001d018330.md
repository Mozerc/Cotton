## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001d018330]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmmtRF2a</u>
- **Gene Name:** crumpled kernel5
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmmtRF2a** is missing the 5thâ€“7th exons in the crk5 resulting in deletion of domains containing motifs GGQ and SPF that are essential for release activity of RF, mitochondrial ribosome binding, and stop codon recognition.
   - Our results showed that the loss of **ZmmtRF2a** function alters the transcript and protein levels for several important components of both the mitochondrial transport chain complex and mitochondrial ribosome. The study sheds light on the function of mtRF2 in the mitochondrial translation system.
   - **ZmmtRF2a** is constitutively expressed, and its protein is localized to mitochondria.
   - Together, our data support a crucial role for **ZmmtRF2a** in regulation of mitochondrial structure and function in maize.
