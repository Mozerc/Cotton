## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb091250]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZM908|Zm908p11</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZM908|Zm908p11**, encoded by a short open reading frame (sORF) gene, functions in pollen tube growth as a profilin ligand in maize.
   - The longest ORF of **ZM908|Zm908p11** encodes a small protein of 97 amino acids. This was designated as **ZM908|Zm908p11** and is distributed throughout the maize pollen tube. Western blot detected the small peptide in mature pollen.
   - Overexpression of **ZM908|Zm908p11** in maize decreased pollen germination efficiency.
   - Taken together, these results indicate that **ZM908|Zm908p11** functions as **ZM908|Zm908p11**, and binds to profilins as a novel ligand, with a required role during pollen tube growth in maize.
   - A model is proposed for the role of **ZM908|Zm908p11** during pollen tube growth in maize.
