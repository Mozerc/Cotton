## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb011780]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmCOI2a|coi4</u>
- **Gene Name:** coronatine insensitive4
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmCOI2a|coi4** and ZmCOI2b redundantly regulate anther dehiscence and gametophytic male fertility in maize.
   - **ZmCOI2a|coi4** and ZmCOI2b, that redundantly regulate gametophytic male fertility. Both **ZmCOI2a|coi4** and ZmCOI2b are highly homologous and constitutively expressed in all tissues tested. Subcellular localization revealed that **ZmCOI2a|coi4** and ZmCOI2b were located in the nucleus.
   - The coi2a coi2b double mutant, generated by CRISPR/Cas9, had non-dehiscent anthers, delayed anther development and MS. In addition, coi2a coi2b male gametes could not be transmitted to the next generation because of severe defects in pollen germination.
