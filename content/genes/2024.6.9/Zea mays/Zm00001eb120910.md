## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb120910]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmPRA1.C1</u>
- **Gene Name:** MAIZE PRENYLATED RAB ACCEPTOR 1.C1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - MAIZE PRENYLATED RAB ACCEPTOR 1.C1 (**ZmPRA1.C1**) was identified as a client of ZmHUG1, and heat-induced aggregation of **ZmPRA1.C1** was accelerated in the zmhug1 mutant.
   - ZmHUG1 interacts directly with **ZmPRA1.C1** (PRENYLATED RAB ACCEPTOR 1.C1) and alleviates its heat-induced aggregation. Collectively, ZmHUG1 is an important molecular chaperone involved in maize heat stress tolerance.
   - It would be intriguing to test the performance of transgenic maize co-overexpressing **ZmPRA1.C1** and ZmHUG1 in response to heat stress in the future.
   - We speculate that **ZmPRA1.C1** interacts with ZmRabD1/ZmRabD2c and stabilizes their ER membrane distribution to guarantee efficient exporting of different cargo proteins from ER via vesicle trafficking, especially under heat stress conditions.
