## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmWUS1-B</u>
- **Gene Name:** WUS1 protein
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **ZmWUS1-B** is controlled by a spontaneously generated novel promoter region that dramatically increases its expression and alters patterning and development of young ears.
   - Overexpression of **ZmWUS1-B** is caused by a unique enhancer region containing multimerized binding sites for type B RESPONSE REGULATORs (RRs), key transcription factors in cytokinin signaling.
   - In combination with dual-luciferase assays in maize protoplasts, our analysis reveals that AGATAT motifs have an additive effect on **ZmWUS1-B** expression, while the distance separating AGATAT motifs does not appear to have a meaningful impact, indicating that the enhancer activity derives from the sum of individual CREs.
   - These results also suggest that in maize inflorescence development, there is a threshold of buffering capacity for ZmWUS1 overexpression.
