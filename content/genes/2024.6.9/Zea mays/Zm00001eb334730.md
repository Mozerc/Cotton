## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb334730]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmLrk-1|ZmWAKL47</u>
- **Gene Name:** Ser/Thr receptor-like kinase1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identification and characterization of **ZmLrk-1|ZmWAKL47**, a member of the Lrk class of receptor-like kinases in Zea mays. This gene was found to be located at the bin21.40 region on the short arm of maize chromosome 8, closely linked to the previously reported pseudogene of the same class ÏˆZmLrk (originally called Zm2Lrk).
   - **ZmLrk-1|ZmWAKL47** transcripts can be detected by in situ hybridization exclusively at the basal endosperm transfer cell layer during the first stages of development.
   - **ZmLrk-1|ZmWAKL47** expression is not induced after treatment with salicylic acid, jasmonic acid or wounding, but it clearly increases after infection of germinating seeds with Fusarium oxysporum.
   - **ZmLrk-1|ZmWAKL47** could be involved in a sensing system to activate plant defence mechanisms against fungal attacks during endosperm development and seed germination.
