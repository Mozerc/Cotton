## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb193160]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Opaque1|O1</u>
- **Gene Name:** opaque endosperm1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Here, we report the functional characterization of maize (Zea mays) **Opaque1|O1** (**Opaque1|O1**), which encodes a myosin XI protein.
   - **Opaque1|O1** is a classic maize seed mutant with an opaque endosperm phenotype but a normal zein protein content. Compared with the wild type, **Opaque1|O1** endosperm cells display dilated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structures and an increased number of smaller, misshapen protein bodies.
   - The **Opaque1|O1** gene was isolated by map-based cloning and was shown to encode a member of the plant myosin XI family (myosin XI-I). In endosperm cells, the **Opaque1|O1** protein is associated with rough ER and protein bodies.
   - Overexpression of the **Opaque1|O1** tail domain (the C-terminal 644 amino acids) significantly inhibited ER streaming in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) cells.
   - This study indicated that **Opaque1|O1** influences protein body biogenesis by affecting ER morphology and motility, ultimately affecting endosperm texture.
