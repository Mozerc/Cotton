## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb298370]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DEK58</u>
- **Gene Name:** defective kernel58
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DEK58** encodes an Rrp15p domain-containing protein with 15.3% identity to yeast Rrp15. Over-expression of **DEK58** rescues the mutant phenotype.
   - **DEK58** is localized in the nucleolus. Ribosome profiling and RNA gel blot analyses show that the absence of **DEK58** reduces ribosome assembly and impedes pre-rRNA processing, accompanied by the accumulation of nearly all the pre-rRNA processing intermediates and the production of an aberrant processing product P-25S*.
   - **DEK58** is essential to seed development in maize. It functions in the early stage of pre-rRNA processing in ribosome biogenesis, possibly through interacting with ZmSSF1 and ZmCK2Î± in maize.
   - This event occurs during the pre-90S stage, as 35S serves as a diagnostic intermediate for this early processome, implying that **DEK58** plays a role in the early stage of pre-rRNA processing in maize.
