## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb232260]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmMPK7|ZmMPK14</u>
- **Gene Name:** MAP kinase14
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Abscisic acid and hydrogen peroxide induce a novel maize group C MAP kinase gene, **ZmMPK7|ZmMPK14**, which is responsible for the removal of reactive oxygen species.
   - Exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced calcium-dependant transcription of **ZmMPK7|ZmMPK14**. Induction of this gene in response to ABA was blocked by several reactive oxygen species (ROS) manipulators such as imidazole, Tiron, and dimethylthiourea (DMTU).
   - This result indicates that endogenous H2O2 may be required for **ZmMPK7|ZmMPK14**-mediated ABA signaling. Expression of **ZmMPK7|ZmMPK14** in Nicotonia tobaccum caused less H2O2 to accumulate and alleviated ROS-mediated injuries following submission of the plants to osmotic stress. 
   - Finally, we have shown that the **ZmMPK7|ZmMPK14** protein localizes in the nucleus. These results broaden our knowledge regarding plant group C MAPK activity in response to stress signals.
