## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb360640]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmWAK-RLK1|Htn1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Helminthosporium turcicum resistanceN1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Fungal resistance mediated by maize wall-associated kinase **ZmWAK-RLK1|Htn1** correlates with reduced benzoxazinoid content.
   - Investigated the function of the maize gene **ZmWAK-RLK1|Htn1** (**ZmWAK-RLK1|Htn1**) that confers quantitative resistance to northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) caused by the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Exserohilum turcicum.
   - **ZmWAK-RLK1|Htn1** was found to localize to the plasma membrane and its presence resulted in a modification of the infection process by reducing pathogen penetration into host tissues. 
   - This indicates that **ZmWAK-RLK1|Htn1** plays role in the reduction of pathogen penetration into host tissues, in agreement with the partial resistance/delayed susceptibility.
