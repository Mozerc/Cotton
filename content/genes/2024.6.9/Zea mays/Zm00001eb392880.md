## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb392880]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmSUS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** sucrose synthase1
- **Genome:** [Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0]()
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of the **ZmSUS1** gene alters the content and composition of endosperm starch in maize.
   - **ZmSUS1** increases the amylose content of maize by regulating the expression of Shrunken2 (Sh2) and Brittle2 (Bt2) which encode the size subunits of endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and Granule bound starchsynthase1 (GBSS1) and Starch synthase1 (SS1).
   - These results indicated that overexpression of **ZmSUS1** can significantly improve the traits of maize seeds and obtain new lines with high amylose content. It was also found that the overexpression of **ZmSUS1** may increase the amylose content by altering the expression of endosperm ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) subunits Shrunken2 (Sh2) and Brittle2 (Bt2).
   - The ectopic expression of **ZmSUS1** also affected the expression of Granule bound starch synthase1 (GBSS1) and Starch synthase1 (SS1) which encode starch synthase. This study proved the important role of **ZmSUS1** in maize starch synthesis and provided a new technology strategy for improving maize starch content and yield.
