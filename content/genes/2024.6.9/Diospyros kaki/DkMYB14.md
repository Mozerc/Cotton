## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>DkMYB14</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Diospyros kaki*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **DkMYB14** is a bifunctional transcription factor that regulates the accumulation of proanthocyanidin in persimmon fruit.
   - Demonstrate here that **DkMYB14**, which regulates the accumulation of PA in persimmon fruit flesh, is a bifunctional transcription factor that acts as a repressor in PA biosynthesis but becomes an activator when involved in acetaldehyde biosynthesis.
   - We show that the amino acid Gly39 in the R2 domain and the ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression-like motif in the C-terminal of **DkMYB14** are essential for the regulation of both PA and acetaldehyde synthesis. 
   - Our results demonstrate that **DkMYB14** functions as both a transcriptional activator and a repressor, directly repressing biosynthesis of PA and promoting its insolubilization, resulting in non-astringency in persimmon.
