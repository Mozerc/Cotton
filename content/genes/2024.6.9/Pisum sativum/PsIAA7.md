## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PsIAA7</u>
- **Gene Name:** Aux/IAA
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pisum sativum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Found that all five pea TIR1/AFB receptor proteins interacted with the pea AUX/IAAs PsIAA6 and/or **PsIAA7** in an auxin-dependent manner, a requirement for functional auxin receptors.
   - PsAFB6 with PsIAA6 and **PsIAA7**, provide evidence that all five TIR1/AFB family members of pea are functional auxin receptors.
   - When the pea Aux/IAAs PsIAA6, **PsIAA7**, PsIAA8, and PsIAA9a were aligned with those of Arabidopsis, the four domains could be recognized in all the proteins, together with important characteristic motifs.
