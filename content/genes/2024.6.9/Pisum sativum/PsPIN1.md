## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PsPIN1</u>
- **Gene Name:** auxin efflux carrier protein PIN1
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pisum sativum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - PsPK2 (the gene for a pea homolog of Arabidopsis PID , a regulator of PIN1 targeting), **PsPIN1** (the major gene for a putative auxin efflux carrier) and LE (a gibberellin biosynthesis gene, GA3ox ), and also examined mutual hormonal regulation of these genes, in pea shoot tips, including a number of mutants.
   - PsPK2 and **PsPIN1** are positively regulated by gibberellin and auxin, and were induced to higher levels by simultaneous application of auxin and gibberellin.
   - Auxin induction of Uni, PsPK2 and **PsPIN1** did not require de novo protein synthesis. LE was positively regulated by auxin and cytokinin. In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis that auxin and gibberellin positively regulate Uni , which controls pea compound leaf development.
   - Also, Uni, **PsPIN1**, PsPK2 and LE are expressed differentially in the leaf mutants, suggesting that mutual regulation by auxin and gibberellin promotes compound leaf development.
