## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PsAFB6</u>
- **Gene Name:** TIR1/AFB 6
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pisum sativum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Pericarp **PsAFB6** expression was suppressed by seeds and increased in response to deseeding, and exogenous hormone treatments suggest that seed-derived auxin and deseeding-induced ethylene are involved in these responses, respectively.
   - Ethylene-induced elevation of pericarp **PsAFB6** expression was associated with 4-Cl-IAA-specific reduction in ethylene responsiveness.
   - Overall, auxin receptors had overlapping and unique developmental and hormone-regulated gene expression patterns during fruit/seed development, suggesting mediation of diverse responses to auxin, with **PsAFB6** linking auxin and ethylene signaling.
