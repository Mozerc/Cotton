## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PsIAA8</u>
- **Gene Name:** Aux/IAA
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Pisum sativum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The interaction of the pea TIR1/AFB proteins with **PsIAA8** and PsIAA9a proteins in the presence of auxin was quite variable in this Y2H assay system and requires testing using another Y2H system that may be more sensitive to proteinâ€“protein interactions promoted by auxin.
   - **PsIAA8** and PsIAA9a grouped within the same clade, while PsIAA6 and PsIAA7 grouped to separate clades.
   - When the pea Aux/IAAs PsIAA6, PsIAA7, **PsIAA8**, and PsIAA9a were aligned with those of Arabidopsis, the four domains could be recognized in all the proteins, together with important characteristic motifs.
