## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsGT45</u>
- **Gene Name:** flavonoid glucosyltransferase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Crocus sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using degenerate primers designed to match the plant secondary product glucosyltransferase (PSPG) box we cloned a full length cDNA encoding **CsGT45** from C. sativus stigmas. 
   - In vitro reactions showed that **CsGT45** catalyses the transfer of glucose from UDP_glucose to kaempferol and quercetin.
   - Kaempferol is the unique flavonol present in C. sativus stigmas and the levels of its glucosides changed during stigma development, and these changes, are correlated with the expression levels of **CsGT45** during these developmental stages.
   - Findings presented here suggest that **CsGT45** is an active enzyme that plays a role in the formation of flavonoid glucosides in C. sativus.
