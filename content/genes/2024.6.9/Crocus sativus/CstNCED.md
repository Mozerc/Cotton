## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CstNCED</u>
- **Gene Name:** plastid 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Crocus sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - An NCED gene, **CstNCED**, was cloned from Crocus sativus stigmas. The deduced amino acid sequence of the **CstNCED** protein shared high identity with other monocot NCEDs, and was closely related to the liliopsida enzymes.
   - At the N-terminus of **CstNCED** a chloroplast transit peptide sequence is located. However, its expression in chloroplast-free tissues suggested localization in other plastid types. The relationship between expression of **CstNCED** and the endogenous ABA level was investigated in the stigma and corms, where it was developmentally regulated.
   - The senescence of the unpollinated stigma is preceded by an increase in ABA levels and **CstNCED** expression. In corms, a correlation was observed between **CstNCED** expression and dormancy.
   - **CstNCED** expression was correlated with the presence of zeaxanthin in the dormant corms. When detached C. sativus leaves and stigmas were water and salt stressed, increases in **CstNCED** mRNA were observed. The results provided evidence of the involvement of **CstNCED** in the regulation of ABA-associated processes such as flower senescence and corm dormancy in monocotyledonous saffron.
