## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsFTL3</u>
- **Gene Name:** FLOWERING LOCUS T-like 3
- **Genome:** []()
- **Species:** *Chrysanthemum seticuspe*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - In chrysanthemums, FLOWERING LOCUS T-like 3 (FTL3) has been identified as a floral inducer produced in the leaves after short-day stimuli and transported to the shoot tip.
   - High temperature-induced FTL3 repression was observed in the leaves of both cultivars, although the degree of repression was greater in the heat-sensitive cultivar than in the heat-tolerant cultivar.
   - Thus, several lines of evidence suggest that the reduction of FTL3 signalling from the leaves to the shoot tip at high temperatures is involved in flowering retardation in chrysanthemums.
   - **CsFTL3**, a chrysanthemum FLOWERING LOCUS T-like gene, is a key regulator of photoperiodic flowering in chrysanthemums.
   - Taken together, these results indicate that the gene product of **CsFTL3** is a key regulator of photoperiodic flowering in chrysanthemums.
   - The results of these experiments suggest that impaired FTL3 signalling from leaves to the SAM at high temperatures is involved in flowering retardation of chrysanthemums.
