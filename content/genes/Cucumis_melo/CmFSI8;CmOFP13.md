## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[MELO3C025206]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u> CmFSI8;CmOFP13 </u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Melon (DHL92) 3.6.1]()
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - CmFSI8/**CmOFP13** was mainly expressed in the ovary, and genomic variation in its promoter was found to play a key role in its function by affecting its transcription, indicating that the expression level of CmFSI8/**CmOFP13** was responsible for controlling melon fruit shape.
   - CmFSI8/**CmOFP13** encoding an OVATE family protein controls fruit shape in melon.
   - Ectopic overexpression of CmFSI8/**CmOFP13** in Arabidopsis led to multiple phenotypic changes, including kidney-shaped leaves and shortened siliques.
   - The transcription level of CmFSI8/**CmOFP13** in the ovary of HP22 was significantly higher than that in B8, and sequence analysis showed that a 12.5-kb genomic variation with a retrotransposon insertion identified in the promoter was responsible for elevating the expression, and this ultimately caused the differences in fruit shape.
