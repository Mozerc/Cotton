## Functional Descriptions:
   - The elongation of palmitic acid to stearic acid by the 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (KASII) enzyme represents a branch point in the pathway of oil biosynthesis in soybean.
   - In particular, the intermediate levels of palmitic acid produced in the seeds of the KASIIaA469T mutant provide a resource to fine-tune oil content in a way that was not previously available to breeders and geneticists.
   - These new mutant alleles of soybean KASIIa may be useful to fine-tune the composition of soybean seed oil using molecular breeding approaches.
