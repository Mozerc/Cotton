## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.08g083300	](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=Glyma.08g083300	)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmFLS2a</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a4_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a4_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmFLS2a** and GmFLS2b are likely redundant. They are not distinguishable by the VIGS knockout approach. When both of these genes are silenced, soy plants became much more suceptible to bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea), but resistance to viral pathogens (Soybean mosaic virus) is not affected.
   - Silencing GmFLS2 in soybean does not result in visible morphological changes.
   - Silencing GmFLS2 enhances the susceptibility of soybean to bacterial pathogen through attenuating the activation of GmMAPK signaling pathway.
   - **GmFLS2a** and GmFLS2b might function redundantly in soybean.
