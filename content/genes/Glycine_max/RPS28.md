## Functional Descriptions:
   - Our results indicate the potential of **RPS28** and EIF1 promoters to facilitate future genetic engineering and breeding to improve the quality and yield of soybean, as well as in a wide variety of other plant species.
   - Two FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) homologs, FT2a and FT5a, have been identified as encoding components of florigen and controlling flowering time in soybean . The expression levels of these two genes are down-regulated by E1, E2, E3, and E4 under long-day (LD) conditions, suggesting that FT2a and FT5a are the major soybean flowering regulation targets . Subsequent studies have shown that E9 is FT2a, with a Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon SORE-1 inserted in its first intron in its recessive allele.
   - Characterization of two constitutive promoters **RPS28** and EIF1 for studying soybean growth, development, and symbiotic nodule development.
   - Determined that **RPS28** and EIF1 were highly expressed during soybean growth and development, nodule development, and various biotic and abiotic stresses.
   - Fusion of both **RPS28** and EIF1 promoters, with or without their first intron, with the reporter gene β-GLUCURONIDASE (uidA) in transgenic soybean, resulted in high GUS activity in seedlings, seeds, and nodules.
   - The potential of **RPS28** and EIF1 promoters to facilitate future genetic engineering and breeding to improve the quality and yield of soybean, as well as in a wide variety of other plant species.
