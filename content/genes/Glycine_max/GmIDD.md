## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.14G095900](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=Glyma.14G095900)
- **Gene Symbol:** GmIDD
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Comparisons between plants exposed to different day lengths indicated that **GmIDD** was induced by short days. Overexpression of **GmIDD** induces early flowering in WT Arabidopsis plants and restores normal flowering time to late-flowering Arabidopsis mutants. Genes acted on by the **GmIDD**-endcoded transcription factor identified by ChIP-Seq.
   - **GmIDD** is induced by short days and promotes flowering in soy, maize, rice, and Arabidopsis.
   - Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that **GmIDD** was induced by short day conditions in leaves and regulated by circadian clock.
   - **GmIDD** appeared to inhibit the transcriptional activity of AGL18 and induced the expression of FT gene to promote Arabidopsis flowering.
