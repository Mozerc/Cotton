## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.14G095900]()
- **Gene Symbol:** GmIDD
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Description:
   - Comparisons between plants exposed to different day lengths indicated that **GmIDD** was induced by short days. Overexpression of **GmIDD** induces early flowering in WT Arabidopsis plants and restores normal flowering time to late-flowering Arabidopsis mutants. Genes acted on by the **GmIDD**-endcoded transcription factor identified by ChIP-Seq.
   - **GmIDD** is induced by short days and promotes flowering in soy, maize, rice, and Arabidopsis.
