## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.18G273600](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=Glyma.18G273600)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmDT2</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a4_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a4_v1)

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Natural variation in Dt2 predominantly determines soybean branching.
   - Dt2, GmAgl22 and GmSoc1a could interact with each other and affect the branch number.
   - Dt2 regulates the expression of the GmAp1 gene family.
   - Population genetic investigation show that the genetic differentiation of Dt2 display significant geographic structure. 
   - The selection of Dt2 is associated with geographic differentiation. Modulating Dt2 lines resulted in significantly increase of soybean adaptation and yield, which is also associated with its effect on maturity.
