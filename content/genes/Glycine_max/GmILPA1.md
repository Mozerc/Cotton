## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.11G026400.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** GmILPA1
- **Gene Name:** Increased Leaf Petiole Angle1
- **Genome Version:** [Williams 82 reference genome]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Description:
   - Functional characterization of Glycine max Increased Leaf Petiole Angle1 (**GmILPA1**), a gene encoding an APC8-like protein, which is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome in soybean (Glycine max). 
   - **GmILPA1** is mainly expressed in the basal cells of leaf primordia and appears to function by promoting cell growth and division of the pulvinus that is critical for its establishment.
   - **GmILPA1** directly interacts with GmAPC13a as part of the putative anaphase-promoting complex. **GmILPA1** exhibits variable expression levels among varieties with different degrees of LPAs, and expression levels are correlated with the degrees of the LPAs.
