## Functional Descriptions:
   - A small heat shock protein, **GmHSP17.9**, from nodule confers symbiotic nitrogen fixation and seed yield in soybean.
   - In the present study, we identified a nodule-localized sHSP, called **GmHSP17.9**, in soybean, which was markedly up-regulated during nodule development.
   - **GmHSP17.9** was specifically expressed in the infected regions of the nodules.
   - **GmHSP17.9** was also found to act as a chaperone for its interacting partner, GmNOD100, a sucrose synthase in soybean nodules which was also preferentially expressed in the infected zone of nodules, similar to **GmHSP17.9**.
   - **GmHSP17.9** overexpression and RNAi in transgenic composite plants and loss of function in CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing mutant plants in soybean resulted in remarkable alterations in nodule number, nodule fresh weight, nitrogenase activity, contents of poly β-hydroxybutyrate bodies (PHBs), ureide and total nitrogen content, which caused significant changes in plant growth and seed yield.
