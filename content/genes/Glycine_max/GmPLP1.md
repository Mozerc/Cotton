## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.02g022000](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=Glyma.02g022000)
- **Gene Symbol:** GmPLP1
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmPLP1** negatively regulates soybean resistance to high light stress by modulating photosynthetic capacity and reactive oxygen species accumulation in a blue light-dependent manner.
   - The abundance of **GmPLP1**, a positive blue light receptor protein, was significantly inhibited by high light stress and mainly responded to high blue light.
   - **GmPLP1** RNA-interference soybean lines exhibited higher light energy utilization ability and less light damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in leaves under high light stress, while the phenotype of **GmPLP1**:**GmPLP1**-Flag overexpression soybean showed the opposite characteristics.
   - Identified a protein–protein interaction between **GmPLP1** and GmVTC2, and the intensity of this interaction was primarily affected by sensing the intensity of blue light.
   - This study discovered a new mechanism through which **GmPLP1** participates in high light stress in soybean, which has great significance for improving soybean yield and the adaptability of soybean to high light.
