- **Gene Symbol:** GmST1
- **Gene Name:**

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmST1**, which encodes a sulfotransferase, confers resistance to soybean mosaic virus strains G2 and G3.
   - Fine mapping results showed that soybean resistance to SMV strains G2 and G3 was controlled by a single dominant gene, **GmST1**, on chromosome 13, encoding a sulfotransferase (SOT).
   - These results suggested that **GmST1** was regulated by SMV infection and that this gene was differentially expressed between SMV-resistant and -susceptible soybean cultivars.
   - This characterization of **GmST1** suggests a new scenario explaining soybean resistance to SMV.
   - The overexpression of **GmST1** carrying the RSVG2-R allele from the SMV-resistant line “Dongnong93-046” conferred resistance to SMV strains G2 and G3.
