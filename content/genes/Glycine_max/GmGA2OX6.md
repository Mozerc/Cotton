## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.13G259400]()
- **Gene Symbol:** GmGA2OX6
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Description:
   - Suggesting that **GmGA2OX6** may delay flowering, similar to its Arabidopsis ortholog GA2OX. However, further work is needed to test how each of these genes and the alleles described here affect flowering time in cultivated soybean.
   - **GmGA2OX6** regulates photoperiodic flowering time
   - **GmGA2OX6** regulates photoperiodic days to maturity
