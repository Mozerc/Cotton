## Functional Descriptions:
   - Natural variation of FKF1 controls flowering and adaptation during soybean domestication and improvement.
   - Demonstrate that the natural allele FKF1 facilitated adaptation of soybean to high-latitude environments and was selected during domestication and improvement, leading to its rapid expansion in cultivated soybean.
   - These findings provide novel insights into the roles of FKF1 in controlling flowering time and maturity in soybean and offer new means to fine-tune adaptation to high latitudes and increase grain yield.
   - FKF1s have roles in the unique soybean photoperiodic flowering pathway.
