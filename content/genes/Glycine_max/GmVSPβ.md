- **Gene Symbol:** GmVSPβ
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - GmN:IFR play crucial roles in coordinated plant defense regulation, which provides valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in insect-induced transcriptional regulation in soybean.
   - Two defense-related genes, **GmVSPβ** and GmN:IFR, a high proportion of transcription factors (TFs) participate in the incompatible soybean-common cutworm interaction networks.
   - GmVSPα, **GmVSPβ**, and GmN:IFR, revealed the enrichment of various TF-binding sites for defense and stress responses.
   - Suggesting that **GmVSPβ** and GmN:IFR most likely represent inducible promoters related to the induced defense mechanism in soybean.
