## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma17g05200]()
- **Gene Symbol:** KASIIa
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [glyma.Wm82.gnm1.ann1]()
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Description:
   - The elongation of palmitic acid to stearic acid by the 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase II (KASII) enzyme represents a branch point in the pathway of oil biosynthesis in soybean. 
   - In particular, the intermediate levels of palmitic acid produced in the seeds of the **KASIIa**A469T mutant provide a resource to fine-tune oil content in a way that was not previously available to breeders and geneticists.
