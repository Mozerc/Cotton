## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.16g212300](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=Glyma.16g212300)
- **Gene Symbol:** Rj2
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Some alleles of **Rj2** restrict nodulation to specific rhizobial strains.
   - Symbiotic incompatibility between soybean and Bradyrhizobium arises from one amino acid determinant in soybean **Rj2** protein.
   - The **Rj2** allele was also found in Glycine soja, the wild progenitor of G. max, and their single amino acid polymorphisms were associated with the **Rj2**-nodulation phenotype.
   - **Rj2** allele restricts nodulation with specific Bradyrhizobium strains via host immunity, mediated by rhizobial type III secretory protein NopP and the host resistance protein **Rj2**.
