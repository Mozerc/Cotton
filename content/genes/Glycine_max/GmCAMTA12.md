## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.17G031900](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=Glyma.17G031900)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmCAMTA12</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **GmCAMTA12** increases drought tolerance in Glycine max and Arabidopsis.
   - **GmCAMTA12** Overexpression Regenerated More Developed and Drought-Efficient Hairy Roots in Soybean.
   - **GmCAMTA12** overexpression in soybean promoted drought-efficient hairy roots in OE chimeric plants as compare to that of VC (Vector control).
   - We report that **GmCAMTA12** plays substantial role in tolerance of soybean against drought stress and could prove to be a novel candidate for engineering soybean and other plants against drought stress.
   - **GmCAMTA12** as a transcription factor plays role in drought stress by regulating the downstream genes involved in drought tolerance and could be exploited in developing drought-tolerant crops.
