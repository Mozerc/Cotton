## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.08g109100](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=Glyma.08g109100)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ST1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Seed Thickness 1
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Identification of **ST1** reveals a selection involving hitchhiking of seed morphology and oil content during soybean domestication.
   - This morphological change concurrently boosted seed oil content, which, along with up-regulation of glycolysis biosynthesis modulated by **ST1**, enabled soybean to become a staple oil crop.
   - **ST1** and an inversion controlling seed coat colour formed part of a single selective sweep.
   - Structural variation analysis of the region surrounding **ST1** shows that the critical mutation in **ST1** existed in earlier wild relatives of soybean and the region containing **ST1** subsequently underwent an inversion, which was followed by successive selection for both traits through hitchhiking during selection for seed coat colour.
   - **ST1** (Seed Thickness 1), affecting seed thickness and encoding a UDP-D-glucuronate 4-epimerase, which catalyses UDP-galacturonic acid production and promotes pectin biosynthesis.
