## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Glyma.16G141400.2](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Triticum_aestivum/Gene/Summary?g=Glyma.16G141400.2)
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Pdh1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Pod dehiscence 1
- **Genome:** [Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Parallel selection of loss-of-function alleles of **Pdh1** orthologous genes in warm-season legumes for pod indehiscence and plasticity is related to precipitation.
   - We characterized the pod dehiscence of chromosome segment substitution lines of Glycine max crossed with Glycine soja and found that the gene underlying the predominant quantitative trait locus (QTL) of soybean pod-shattering trait was Pod dehiscence 1 (**Pdh1**).
   - We found that orthologous **Pdh1** genes specifically originated in warm-season legumes and their LoF alleles were then parallel-selected during the domestication of legume crops.
   - A specific LoF haplotype of **Pdh1** was selected during soybean domestication.
   - We identified **Pdh1** orthologous genes and revealed the specific origin and convergent evolution of this gene for pod dehiscence in warm-season legumes, recruiting the LoF mutation of **Pdh1** orthologous genes as an evolutionary mechanism for pod indehiscence.
