## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:**	[Bradi2g07070]()
- **Gene Symbol:** BdFTL1
- **Gene Name:** FLOWERING LOCUS T1
- **Genome:** [BdGDB](http://plantgdb.org/BdGDB/)
- **Species:** *Brachypodium distachyon*

## Functional Description:
   - Transgenic assays showed that both **BdFTL1** and BdFTL2 could promote flowering, whereas BdFTL2 was essential for flowering initiation.
   - **BdFTL1** and BdFTL2 had similar transcription patterns in different tissues, developmental phases, and during responses to the light/dark shift, indicating that transcriptional regulation was not likely to be the key element causing large functional differences in flowering.
   - This suggested that AS of **BdFTL1** might impair its function in flowering during these early developmental stages.
   - Our data collectively suggested that BdES43 might regulate the transcription and AS of **BdFTL1** by interacting with H3K4me3.
