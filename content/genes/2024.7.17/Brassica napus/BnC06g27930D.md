## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [BnC06g27930D]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BnHva22c</u>
- **Gene Name:** HVA22-like protein c
- **Genome:** [Darmor-bzh v10 Genome](https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/projet_CCM/cgi-bin/webBlat)
- **Species:** *Brassica napus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Knock-out of **BnHva22c** reduces the susceptibility of Brassica napus to infection with the fungal pathogen Verticillium longisporum.
   - Identification of Hva22c as a novel susceptibility factor and its potential for improving OSR resistance.
   - Demonstrate that knock-out of Hva22c in OSR by CRISPR/Cas9 and its homolog in Arabidopsis by T-DNA insertion reduced plantsâ€™ susceptibility to Vl43 infection and impaired the development of disease symptoms.
   - Hva22c might be involved in potyvirus replication and movement through the plasmodesmata.
   - These results demonstrate that Hva22c is functionally required for a fully compatible plant-fungus interaction.
