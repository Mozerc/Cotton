## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Bradi2g47590]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SWAM1</u>
- **Gene Name:** SECONDARY WALL ASSOCIATED MYB1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Brachypodium distachyon*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **SWAM1** overexpression (SWAM-OE) lines had greater above-ground biomass with only a slight change in flowering time while **SWAM1** dominant repressor (**SWAM1**-DR) plants were severely dwarfed with a striking reduction in lignin of sclerenchyma fibers and stem epidermal cell length.
   - Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin genes were significantly down-regulated in **SWAM1**-DR plants and up-regulated in **SWAM1**-OE plants.
   - **SWAM1** interacts with cellulose and lignin gene promoters with preferential binding to AC-rich sequence motifs commonly found in the promoters of cell wall-related genes.
   - Phylogenetic and syntenic analyses strongly suggest that the **SWAM1** clade was present in the last common ancestor between eudicots and grasses, but is not in the Brassicaceae.
   - These data suggest that **SWAM1** is a transcriptional activator of secondary cell wall thickening and biomass accumulation in B. distachyon.
