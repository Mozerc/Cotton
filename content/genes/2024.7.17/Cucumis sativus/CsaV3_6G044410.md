## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [CsaV3_6G044410]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ACS1G</u>
- **Gene Name:** 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Cucumis sativus*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Gain-of-function of the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase gene **ACS1G** induces female flower development in cucumber gynoecy.
   - Here, we created a set of mutants and revealed that **ACS1G** is responsible for gynoecy conferred by the F locus.
   - The duplication resulted in **ACS1G** acquiring a new promoter and expression pattern; in plants carrying the F locus duplication, **ACS1G** is expressed early in floral bud development, where it functions with ACO2 to generate an ethylene burst.
   - This early **ACS1G** expression bypasses the need for ACS11 to produce ethylene, thereby establishing a dominant pathway for female floral development. Based on these findings, we propose a model for how these ethylene biosynthesis genes cooperate to control unisexual flower development in cucumber.
