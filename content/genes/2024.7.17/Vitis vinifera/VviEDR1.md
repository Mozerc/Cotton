## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VviEDR1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Chimeric mutations in grapevine ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE1 improve resistance to powdery mildew without growth penalty.
   - Grapevine  incurs severe quality degradation and yield loss from powdery mildew, a major fungal disease caused by Erysiphe necator. ENHANCED DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (EDR1), a Raf-like mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, negatively regulates defense responses against powdery mildew in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
   - lantlets containing homozygous and bi-allelic indels in **VviEDR1** developed leaf lesions shortly after transplanting into the soil and died at the seedling stage.
   - **VviEDR1**-chi plants maintained a spatiotemporally distinctive pattern of **VviEDR1** mutagenesis: while almost no mutations were detected from terminal buds, ensuring normal function of the apical meristem, mutations occurred in young leaves and increased as leaves matured, resulting in resistance to powdery mildew.
   - Demonstrated a role of **VviEDR1** in the negative regulation of resistance to powdery mildew in grapevine and provided an avenue for engineering powdery mildew resistance in grapevine.
