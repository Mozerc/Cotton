## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>FaOMT</u>
- **Gene Name:** O-methyltransferase
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Vitis vinifera*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - It is methylated further by **FaOMT** (Fragaria×ananassa O-methyltransferase) to 2,5-dimethyl-4-methoxy-3(2H)-furanone (DMMF) during the ripening process.
   - It is shown here that transformation of strawberry with the **FaOMT** sequence in sense and antisense orientation, under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, resulted in a near total loss of DMMF, whereas the levels of the other volatiles remained unchanged.
   - **FaOMT** repression also affected the ratio of feruloyl 1-O-β-D-glucose and caffeoyl 1-O-β-D-glucose, indicating a dual function of the enzyme in planta.
   - **FaOMT** is involved in at least two different biochemical pathways in ripe strawberry fruit.
