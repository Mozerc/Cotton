## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb342960]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>ZmRACK1|ZmRACK2</u>
- **Gene Name:** receptor for activated C kinase 1
- **Genome:** Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The amino acid sequence of **ZmRACK1|ZmRACK2** had seven WD repeats in which there were typical GH (glycine-histidine) and WD dipeptides.
   - Expression pattern analysis by RT-PCR showed that **ZmRACK1|ZmRACK2** was expressed in all analyzed tissues of maize and that its transcription in leaves was induced by abscisic acid and jasmonate at a high concentration.
   - Overexpression of **ZmRACK1|ZmRACK2** in maize led to a reduction in symptoms caused by Exserohilum turcicum (Pass.) on maize leaves.
   - Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that **ZmRACK1|ZmRACK2** could interact with RAC1, RAR1 and SGT1. This study and previous work leads us to believe that **ZmRACK1|ZmRACK2** may form a complex with regulators of plant disease resistance to coordinate maize reactions to pathogens.
