## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb297040]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Tdy1</u>
- **Gene Name:** tie-dyed1
- **Genome:** Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tie-dyed1 Encodes a Novel, Phloem-Expressed Transmembrane Protein That Functions in Carbohydrate Partitioning.
   - **Tdy1** encodes a novel transmembrane protein present only in grasses, although two protein domains are conserved across angiosperms.
   - **Tdy1** is expressed exclusively in phloem cells of both source and sink tissues, suggesting that **Tdy1** may play a role in phloem loading and unloading processes.
   - **Tdy1** RNA accumulates in protophloem cells upon differentiation, suggesting that **Tdy1** may function as soon as phloem cells become competent to transport assimilates.
   - Even though **Tdy1** RNA accumulates in source and sink tissues, we propose that **Tdy1** functions in carbon partitioning by promoting phloem loading.
   - Tie-dyed1 and sucrose export defective1 act independently to promote carbohydrate export from maize leaves.
