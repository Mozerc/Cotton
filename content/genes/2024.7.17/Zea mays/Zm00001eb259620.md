## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Zm00001eb259620]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>tdy2</u>
- **Gene Name:** tie-dyed2
- **Genome:** Zm-B73-REFERENCE-NAM-5.0
- **Species:** *Zea mays*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Tie-dyed2 Encodes a Callose Synthase That Functions in Vein Development and Affects Symplastic Trafficking within the Phloem of Maize Leaves.
   - The tie-dyed2 (**tdy2**) mutant of maize (Zea mays) displays variegated green and yellow leaves. Intriguingly, the yellow leaf tissues hyperaccumulate starch and sucrose, the soluble sugar transported long distance through the phloem of veins.
   - **tdy2** was most highly expressed in the vascular tissue. Comparative expression analysis with the vascular marker maize PINFORMED1a-yellow fluorescent protein confirmed that **tdy2** was expressed in developing vein tissues.
   - The disruption of sucrose movement in the phloem in **tdy2** mutants provides evidence that the **tdy2** callose synthase functions in vascular maturation and that the vascular defects result in impaired symplastic trafficking into the phloem translocation stream.
   - The results showed that **tdy2** yellow leaf regions were defective in phloem export but competent in long-distance transport.
