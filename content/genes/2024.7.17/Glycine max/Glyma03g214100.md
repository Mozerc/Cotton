## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma03g214100]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmNLA1-1</u>
- **Gene Name:** nitrogen limitation adaptation 1
- **Genome:** [Wm82.a2.v1](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Gmax_Wm82_a2_v1)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Diverse functions of GmNLA1 members in controlling phosphorus homeostasis highlight coordinate response of soybean to nitrogen and phosphorus availability.
   - Redundant and diverse functions present in GmNLA1 members for soybean coordinate responses to P and N availability, which mediate P homeostasis.
   - GmNLA1s suppression in soybean hairy roots.
   - Expression patterns of GmNLA1s in response to P and N availability.
   - Both **GmNLA1-1** and GmNLA1-3 were predominantly located in the plasma membrane and nucleus, whereas, GmNLA1-2 was predominantly located in the plasma membrane.
   - Suppression of GmNLA1s regulates P homeostasis in soybean hairy roots at two P levels.
