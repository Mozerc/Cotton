## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.18G262000.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmMYBA3</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** [Phytozyme 13](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/)
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Molecular and genetic studies have characterized two antagonistic regulators, the positive activator **GmMYBA3** and the negative repressor GmMYBR1, that modulate the gene expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis in soybean flowers.
   - Exploration of additional soybean cultivars demonstrated the universality of **GmMYBA3** and GmMYBR1 in regulating floral anthocyanin biosynthesis- related genes, with GmF3′5′H identified as a crucial determinant of white flower color.
   - **GmMYBA3** not only regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis, but might also be involved in other processes related to flower traits.
   - Functional characterization of **GmMYBA3** as an activator and GmMYBR1 as a repressor in soybean flower coloration.
   - A regulatory loop integrating **GmMYBA3**, GmMYBR1 and GmTT8a influences the modulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes like GmF3′5′H.
