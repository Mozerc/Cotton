## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmFTL2</u>
- **Gene Name:** Glycine max flowering locus T-like protein 2
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **GmFTL2** expression is regulated by developmental and tissue-specific clues and plays roles in seedling establishment and the development of microgametophytes, embryos, and roots.
   - The mechanism of regulation of **GmFTL2** expression differs from that of Arabidopsis AtFT.
   - Regulation of the **GmFTL2** promoter in cotyledons and leaves is developmentally dependent, but independent of photoperiod.
   - **GmFTL2** promoter has high activity in microgametophytes, embryos, and root tips.
