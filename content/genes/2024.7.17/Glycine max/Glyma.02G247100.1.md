## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Glyma.02G247100.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GmMYBR1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Glycine max*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Molecular and genetic studies have characterized two antagonistic regulators, the positive activator GmMYBA3 and the negative repressor **GmMYBR1**, that modulate the gene expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis in soybean flowers.
   - Exploration of additional soybean cultivars demonstrated the universality of GmMYBA3 and **GmMYBR1** in regulating floral anthocyanin biosynthesis- related genes, with GmF3′5′H identified as a crucial determinant of white flower color.
   - Functional characterization of GmMYBA3 as an activator and **GmMYBR1** as a repressor in soybean flower coloration.
   - A regulatory loop integrating GmMYBA3, **GmMYBR1** and GmTT8a influences the modulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes like GmF3′5′H.
