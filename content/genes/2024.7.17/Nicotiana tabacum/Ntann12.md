## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Ntann12</u>
- **Gene Name:** Annexin 12
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The tobacco **Ntann12** gene, encoding an annexin, is induced upon Rhodoccocus fascians infection and during leafy gall development.
   - Expression of this gene, called **Ntann12**, is also induced, but to a lower extent, by a strain (D188-5) that is unable to induce leafy gall formation.
   - **Ntann12** expression was also found to be stimulated by abiotic stress, including NaCl and abscissic acid, confirming a putative role in stress signal transduction pathways.
   - **Ntann12** is indeed induced by various biotic and abiotic stresses and is also shown to be developmentally regulated.
