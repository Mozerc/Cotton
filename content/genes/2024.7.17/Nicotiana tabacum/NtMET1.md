## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NtMET1</u>
- **Gene Name:** DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Nicotiana tabacum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A Tobacco **NtMET1** cDNA Encoding a DNA Methyltransferase: Molecular Characterization and Abnormal Phenotypes of Transgenic Tobacco Plants.
   - RNA blot analysis indicated **NtMET1** transcripts to accumulate in dividing tissues of tobacco plants, and they could be detected during the S phase in synchronized dividing BY2 cells.
   - A cDNA encoding a DNA methyltransferase, with a predicted polypeptide of 1556 amino acid residues containing all motifs conserved in this enzyme family, was isolated from tobacco plants, and the corresponding gene was designated as **NtMET1**.
   - These results suggest that **NtMET1** functions during DNA replication, and that DNA methylation plays an important role in plant morphogenesis.
