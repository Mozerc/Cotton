## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BjMTP1</u>
- **Gene Name:** Putative metal transport protein 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Brassica juncea*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Steady-state mRNA levels of **BjMTP1** were found to be enhanced 8.8, 5.9, and 1.6-fold in five-day-old B. juncea seedlings after exposure to Ni2+, Cd2+ or Zn2+, respectively.
   - This was also reflected in enhanced GUS activity in B. juncea seedlings transformed with **BjMTP1** promoter::GUSPlus after exposure to these metals over a similar range of toxicities from mild to severe.
   - In four- week- old transgenic plants **BjMTP1** promoter activity also primarily increased in roots in response to Ni2+ or Cd2+ in plants transformed with either GUS or mRFP1 as reporter genes, and expression was localized to the secondary xylem parenchyma.
   - **BjMTP1** promoter activity in response to Ni2+ or Cd2+ spiked after 24 h then decreased. In shoots GUS expression was prominently present in the vasculature of leaves, and floral parts.
