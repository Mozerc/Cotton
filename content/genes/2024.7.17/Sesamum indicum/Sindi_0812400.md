## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Sindi_0812400]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SiRLK1</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Sesamum indicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A marker S3_21381019 developed based on the variation within the **SiRLK1** locus will facilitate marker-assisted breeding for the improvement of sesame disease resistance.
   - **SiRLK1** is also a positive immune modulator in the CrRLK1L subfamily, as it exhibits complete dominance in conferring resistance to SFW.
   - There was considerable evolutionary divergence between **SiRLK1** and the known Fusarium wilt resistance proteins I, I-3, and I-7 in tomatoes.
   - In addition to the three SNPs between **SiRLK1** and **SiRLK1**, several other SNPs in the kinase domain III were associated with the variations in SFW responses of sesame accessions.
