## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsDFRb1</u>
- **Gene Name:** dihydroflavonol 4-reductase
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Functional analysis of the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase family of Camellia sinensis: exploiting key amino acids to reconstruct reduction activity.
   - Enzyme activity analyses revealed that the two recombinant proteins CsDFRa and CsDFRc exhibited DFR activity, converting dihydroflavonols into leucoanthocyanins in vitro, but **CsDFRb1** and CsDFRb3 did not.
   - The expression levels of other genes such as **CsDFRb1**, CsDFRb3, and CsDFRc were highest in the root and lowest in the mature leaf and stem, consistent with the concentration of PA and indicating the involvement of these three genes in PA biosynthesis in the tea plant.
   - As illustrated in Figure 4B, when dihydroflavonols were used as a substrate, no red products were observed, indicating that **CsDFRb1** and CsDFRb3 had little or no reduction activity.
