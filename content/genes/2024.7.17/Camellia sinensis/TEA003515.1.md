## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [TEA003515.1]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CsMYB4a</u>
- **Gene Name:** R2R3-MYB Sg4 member from Camellia sinensis
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Camellia sinensis*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **CsMYB4a** works synergistically with CsIAA4 and participates in regulation of the auxin pathway in stamen.
   - **CsMYB4a** played an indeterminate role in the auxin signaling pathway in addition to regulating the phenylpropanoid pathway, thereby affecting seed germination and plant growth.
   - Both **CsMYB4a** and CsIAA4 have the function in controlling filament length.
   - Seedlings overexpressing **CsMYB4a** and CsIAA4 transgenic exhibited altered responses to exogenous Î±-NAA treatment.
   - LUC activity was not reconstituted when CsIAA7 was the prey protein of **CsMYB4a**, suggesting that CsIAA7 does not physically interact with **CsMYB4a**.
   - **CsMYB4a** interacts with CsIAA4 to prevent its proteolytic degradation.
   - Overexpression of **CsMYB4a** affects growth of tobacco plants by interference with the functional role of NtIAA4.
   - **CsMYB4a** can synergistically act with NtIAA4 in flower controlling filament growth.
   - the regulation of **CsMYB4a** and CsIAA4 in the morphogenesis of tea floral organs.
