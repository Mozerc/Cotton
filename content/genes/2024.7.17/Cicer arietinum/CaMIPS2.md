## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CaMIPS2</u>
- **Gene Name:** L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase2
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Cicer arietinum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Two divergent genes encoding L-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase1 (CaMIPS1) and 2 (**CaMIPS2**) are differentially expressed in chickpea.
   - To explore this, two MIPS genes (CaMIPS1 and **CaMIPS2**) were isolated from a drought-tolerant plant chickpea. Both genes are extremely divergent in respect to their introns, at the same time retaining 85% identity to their exons and functionally complementing inositol auxotroph Schizosaccharomyces pombe.
   - Under environmental stresses, only **CaMIPS2** was induced whereas CaMIPS1 expression remained same, which could be explained by the divergence of their 5â€² upstream regulatory sequences.
   - Our results suggest that CaMIPS1 and **CaMIPS2** are differentially expressed in chickpea to play discrete though overlapping roles in plant; however **CaMIPS2** is likely to be evolved through gene duplication to function under environmental stresses.
