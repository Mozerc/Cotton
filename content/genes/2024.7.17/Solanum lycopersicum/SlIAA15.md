## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>SlIAA15</u>
- **Gene Name:** Auxin-responsive protein
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Solanum lycopersicum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The tomato **SlIAA15** is involved in trichome formation and axillary shoot development.
   - Functional characterization of **SlIAA15**, a member of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Aux/IAA family, shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin-dependent transcription.
   - The physiological significance of **SlIAA15** was addressed by a reverse genetics approach, revealing that **SlIAA15** plays multiple roles in plant developmental processes.
   - The leaves of **SlIAA15**-inhibited plants are dark green and thick, with larger pavement cells, longer palisade cells and larger intercellular space of spongy mesophyll cells.
   - The **SlIAA15**-suppressed plants exhibit a strong reduction in type I, V and VI trichome formation, suggesting that auxin-dependent transcriptional regulation is required for trichome initiation.
