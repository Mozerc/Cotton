## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Bra004503]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BrCCA1</u>
- **Gene Name:** CIRCADIAN AND CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Brassica rapa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Vernalization-mediated demethylation of BrCKA2 (casein kinase II α-subunit) and BrCKB4 (casein kinase II β-subunit) shorten the period of the clock gene **BrCCA1** (circadian clock associated 1) in Brassica rapa.
   - Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of BrCKA2 and BrCKB4 in B. rapa resulted in no change to the period of **BrCCA1** (circadian clock associated 1) and a 1-week late flowering time.
   - Demonstrated that increased levels of BrCKA2 and BrCKB4 in vernalized B. rapa confer elevated CK2 activity, resulting in a shortened period of the clock gene **BrCCA1**, which plays an important role in perceiving photoperiod in plants.
   - **BrCCA1** was detected following silencing of BrCKA2 and BrCKB4, demonstrating that vernalization affects clock genes in B. rapa.
