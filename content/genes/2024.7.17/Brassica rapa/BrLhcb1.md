## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>BrLhcb1</u>
- **Gene Name:** light-harvesting complex of photosystem II 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Brassica rapa*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The increased number of grana thylakoids was associated with the upregulation of light-harvesting complex of photosystem II 1 (**BrLhcb1**).
   - Yeast one-hybrid and transient assay showed that the **BrLhcb1** promoter was directly bound by CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (BrCCA1), resulting in increased **BrLhcb1** expression and enhanced carbon fixation in hybrids.
   - BrCCA1 upregulates **BrLhcb1**, which in turn increases the number of grana thylakoids in the chloroplasts and thereby contributes to the enhanced photosynthesis in pak choi hybrids.
   - In conclusion, we found that **BrLhcb1** upregulation, directly induced by BrCCA1, can increase the number of grana thylakoids in the chloroplasts, thereby contributing to enhanced photosynthesis in pak choi hybrids.
