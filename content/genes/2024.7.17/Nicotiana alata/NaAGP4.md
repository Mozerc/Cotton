## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>NaAGP4</u>
- **Gene Name:** Arabinogalactan protein4
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Nicotiana alata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **NaAGP4** is an arabinogalactan protein whose expression is suppressed by wounding and fungal infection inNicotiana alata.
   - **NaAGP4** likeLeAGP-1 is rapidly suppressed by tissue wounding and by pathogen infection. 
   - We believe **NaAGP4** and LeAGP-1 are the first described examples of orthologous AGPs from different plant species.
   - Another AGP fromN. alata, NaAGP1, is comparatively unaffected by wounding and pathogen infection, although this AGP is expressed in similar tissues and at similar levels as **NaAGP4**.
