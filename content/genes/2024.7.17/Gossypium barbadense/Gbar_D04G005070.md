## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gbar_D04G005070]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GbCML45</u>
- **Gene Name:** calmodulin-like 45
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Gossypium barbadense*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Positive roles of the Ca2+ sensors **GbCML45** and GbCML50 in improving cotton Verticillium wilt resistance.
   - Discovered that the expression level of **GbCML45** was promoted after V. dahliae infection in roots of cotton, suggesting its potential role in Verticillium wilt resistance.
   - Knockdown of **GbCML45** in cotton plants decreased resistance while overexpression of **GbCML45** in Arabidopsis thaliana plants enhanced resistance to V. dahliae infection.
   - Detailed investigations indicated that several defence-related pathways, including salicylic acid, ethylene, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide signalling pathways, as well as accumulations of lignin and callose, are responsible for **GbCML45**- and GbCML50-modulated V. dahliae resistance in cotton.
   - Both **GbCML45** and GbCML50 positively regulate Verticillium wilt resistance in Arabidopsis as their Arabidopsis homologues AtCML46 and AtCML49.
   - These results collectively indicated that **GbCML45** and GbCML50 act as positive regulators to improve cotton Verticillium wilt resistance, providing potential targets for exploitation of improved Verticillium wilt-tolerant cotton cultivars by genetic engineering and molecular breeding.
