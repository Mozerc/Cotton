## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaCKX6-D1</u>
- **Gene Name:** cytokinin oxidase
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaCKX6-D1**, the ortholog of rice OsCKX2, is associated with grain weight in hexaploid wheat.
   - **TaCKX6-D1**, a wheat ortholog of rice OsCKX2, was cloned and its haplotype variants were determined to be significantly associated with the 1000-grain weight on the basis of linkage mapping, association analysis and gene expression analysis.
   - Sequence variations among modern cultivars, landraces and wild species suggest a significant domestication signature at the **TaCKX6-D1** locus in Chinese wheat germplasm.
   - **TaCKX6-D1** may serve as a useful gene for the breeding of high-yielding wheat.
   - An upstream gene or cis factor may affect the function of **TaCKX6-D1**, and the diversity of the regulator gene or cis element and the 18-bp indel are in linkage disequilibrium, just like tb1 in maize.
