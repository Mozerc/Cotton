## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Ta14S</u>
- **Gene Name:** 14-3-3 protein
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - It can be concluded that the high expression of all three **Ta14S** homoeologs in young roots may regulate initial elongation of the radical and affect root development.
   - **Ta14S**-2B had relatively higher expression in 1-day-old roots and shoots, 10-day-old roots, leaves at tillering, and stems at jointing, whereas **Ta14S**-2D was highly expressed in 10-day-old fully expanded leaves.
   - The transcription of **Ta14S**-2B was clearly higher during seed germination, whereas expressions of **Ta14S**-2A and **Ta14S**-2D were up-regulated at the beginning of seed imbibition (0â€“12 h), but declined thereafter.
   - The results suggested that the three **Ta14S** homoeologous genes have regulatory roles in seed development and germination.
