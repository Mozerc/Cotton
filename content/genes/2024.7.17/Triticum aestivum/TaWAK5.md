## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaWAK5</u>
- **Gene Name:** wall-associated kinase 5
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - A novel wheat WAK gene **TaWAK5** from sharp eyespot disease-resistant wheat line CI12633, based on a differentially-expressed sequence identified by microarray analysis.
   - The transcript abundance of **TaWAK5** was rapidly increased following inoculation with the pathogen Rhizoctonia cerealis. **TaWAK5** in resistant wheat lines was induced to higher levels than in susceptible lines at 7 days post inoculation with R. cerealis. 
   - The deduced **TaWAK5** protein contained a signal peptide, two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a transmembrane domain, and a serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain.
   - Subcellular localization analyses in onion epidermal cells indicated that the **TaWAK5** protein was localized to the plasma membrane.
   - **TaWAK5** may be not the major gene in wheat defense response to R. cerealis, or that it is functionally redundant with other genes.
