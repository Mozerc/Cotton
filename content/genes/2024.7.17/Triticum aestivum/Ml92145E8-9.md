## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Ml92145E8-9</u>
- **Gene Name:** Ml92145E8-9
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Molecular mapping of a novel wheat powdery mildew resistance gene **Ml92145E8-9** and its application in wheat breeding by marker-assisted selection.
   - Genetic analysis reveals that the powdery mildew resistance in 92145E8-9 is controlled by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated **Ml92145E8-9**.
   - These findings indicated that **Ml92145E8-9** is non-allelic to either Pm4b or PmLK906. Thus, **Ml92145E8-9** is likely to be a new powdery mildew resistance gene on 2AL.
   - The markers closely linked to **Ml92145E8-9** would be useful in marker-assisted selection for wheat powdery mildew resistance breeding.
