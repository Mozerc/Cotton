## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Pm36</u>
- **Gene Name:** powdery mildew resistance 36
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The isolation of broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance gene **Pm36**, originated from wild emmer wheat, that encodes a tandem kinase with a transmembrane domain (WTK7-TM) through the combination of map-based cloning, PacBio SMRT long-read genome sequencing, mutagenesis, and transformation.
   - Haplotype analysis uncovers that **Pm36** is an orphan gene only present in a few wild emmer wheat, indicating its single ancient origin and potential contribution to the current wheat gene pool.
   - **Pm36**, a wild emmer wheat (WEW)-derived powdery mildew resistance gene, was identified and mapped on chromosome arm 5BL in the tetraploid WEW-durum introgression line 5BIL-29.
   - **Pm36** encodes a unique tandem kinase with a transmembrane domain in the C-terminus (WTK7-TM).
   - **Pm36** is only present in a few WEW populations with a single ancient origin and can potentially contribute to modern wheat improvement.
