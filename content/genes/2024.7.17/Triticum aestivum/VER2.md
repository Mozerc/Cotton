## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>VER2</u>
- **Gene Name:** vernalization-related gene 2
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Vernalization-induced flowering in wheat is mediated by a lectin-like gene **VER2**.
   - RNA in situ hybridization results demonstrated that **VER2** gene expression is restricted to the marginal meristems of immature leaves in vernalized wheat seedlings.
   - The gene expression pattern of **VER2** induced by jasmonate was similar to that induced by vernalization. Antisense inhibition of **VER2** in transgenic wheat showed that heading and maturation time were delayed up to 6 weeks compared with non-transformed wheat and the pBI121empty-vector-transformed wheat.
   - A possible regulatory function for **VER2** in vernalization-induced flowering.
   - These results suggest that **VER2** plays an important role in vernalization signaling and spike development in winter wheat.
