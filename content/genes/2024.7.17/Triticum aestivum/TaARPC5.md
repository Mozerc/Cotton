## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>TaARPC5</u>
- **Gene Name:** actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Triticum aestivum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - **TaARPC5** is required for resistance signaling against Pst infection, and moreover, its functions in this capacity are performed by regulating actin filament organization during infection.
   - **TaARPC5** is differentially induced by both Pst infection and flg22 treatment.
   - **TaARPC5**-GFP fusion protein is located in cytoplasm, nucleus, and the network of actin in both wheat protoplasts and N. benthamiana.
   - The colony sizes on the **TaARPC5**-knockdown plants were particularly noticeable, over twice that on controls.
