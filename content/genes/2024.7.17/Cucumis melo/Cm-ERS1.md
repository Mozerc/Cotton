## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>Cm-ERS1</u>
- **Gene Name:** ethylene response sensor 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Cucumis melo*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Transgenic Lotus japonicus with an Ethylene Receptor Gene **Cm-ERS1**/H70A Enhances Formation of Infection Threads and Nodule Primordia.
   - We produced transgenic Lotus japonicus carrying the mutated melon ethylene receptor gene **Cm-ERS1**/H70A that confers ethylene insensitivity and fixes the transgene in the T3 generation.
   - Because the **Cm-ERS1**/H70A gene was driven by the CaMV-35S promoter, the transgene likely was expressed throughout the entire plant, including the root system.
   - Our results suggest that **Cm-ERS1**/H70A is equally useful for reducing ethylene sensitivity in heterologous Lotus plants.
   - Northern analysis revealed that the level of **Cm-ERS1**mRNA in the pericarp increased in parallel with the increase in fruit size and then markedly decreased at the end of enlargement.
   - During ripening **Cm-ERS1** mRNA increased slightly in the pericarp of fruit before the marked increase of Cm-ETR1 mRNA paralleled climacteric ethylene production.
   - Cm-ETR1 and**Cm-ERS1** play specific roles not only in ripening but also in the early development of melon fruit and that they have distinct roles in particular fruit tissues at particular developmental stages.
