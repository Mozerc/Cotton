## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_D01G0420]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhIQD10</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Overexpression of **GhIQD10** promoted resistance to verticillium wilt in cotton.
   - **GhIQD10** was expressed mainly in the transition period from elongation to SCW synthesis during fiber development, and **GhIQD10**-overexpression lines also exhibited markedly shorter fibers than the recipient Jimian 14 (J14).
   - **GhIQD10** affected fiber length via the Ca2+ signaling pathway by interacting with GhCaM7, and was not associated with the brassinosteroid pathway.
   - **GhIQD10**-overexpression lines have shorter fibers.
   - **GhIQD10**-overexpression lines were insensitive to fumonisin B1 in fiber elongation.
   - Effect of **GhIQD10** on fiber elongation was associated with Ca2+ signaling.
