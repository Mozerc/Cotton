## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [Gh_A09G1166]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhAlaRP-A</u>
- **Gene Name:** 
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - GhAlaRP is highly expressed in rapid elongating cotton fibers.
   - Downregulation of GhAlaRP suppressed the expression levels of GhAnnexin and GhEXPA in cotton fibers.
   - GhAlaRP is thus an essential component of the regulatory network including GhAnnexin and GhEXPA that contributes to cotton fiber elongation.
   - Inhibiting the expression of GhAlaRP had a negative effect on the elongation of cotton fibers.
