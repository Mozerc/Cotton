## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhExp2</u>
- **Gene Name:** alpha-expansin precursor 2
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Exp2 polymorphisms associated with variation for fiber quality properties in cotton.
   - Previous expression profile analysis revealed that six Expansin A genes are present in cotton, of which two (GhExp1 and **GhExp2**) produce transcripts that are specific to the developing cotton fiber. 
   - There was a significant association of Exp2 with fiber quality traits.
   - The amino acid sequence derived from **GhExp2** was most closely related (with 97% sequence identity) to that from GhExp1, which may play an important role in cell wall extension during fiber development.
