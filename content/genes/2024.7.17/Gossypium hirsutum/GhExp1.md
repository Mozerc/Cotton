## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>GhExp1</u>
- **Gene Name:** alpha-expansin precursor 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Gossypium hirsutum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Exp2 polymorphisms associated with variation for fiber quality properties in cotton.
   - Previous expression profile analysis revealed that six Expansin A genes are present in cotton, of which two (**GhExp1** and GhExp2) produce transcripts that are specific to the developing cotton fiber.
   - The amino acid sequence derived from GhExp2 was most closely related (with 97% sequence identity) to that from **GhExp1**, which may play an important role in cell wall extension during fiber development.
   - The results of this study suggest that, like **GhExp1**, Exp2 plays an important role during fiber development.
