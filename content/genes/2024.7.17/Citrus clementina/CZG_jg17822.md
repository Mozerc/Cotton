## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** [CZG_jg17822]()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>CcOMT1</u>
- **Gene Name:** O-methyltransferase
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Citrus reticulata*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Using multi-omics resources, we discover a putative caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (**CcOMT1**) that can transfer a methyl group to the 3-hydroxyl of natsudaidain to form 3,5,6,7,8,3’,4’-heptamethoxyflavone (HPMF). 
   - Based on transient overexpression and virus-induced gene silencing experiments, we propose that **CcOMT1** is a candidate enzyme in HPMF biosynthesis.
   - The results of transient overexpression and silencing of **CcOMT1** suggested that **CcOMT1** might be involved in the biosynthesis of HPMF in CRC.
   - Besides, some environmental stress-related proteins, such as Pti1 and F-box, were also associated with **CcOMT1**, which might indicate that the production of PMFs is related to the stress response.
