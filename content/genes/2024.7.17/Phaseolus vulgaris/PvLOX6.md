## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PvLOX6</u>
- **Gene Name:** Lipoxygenase 6
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Phaseolus vulgaris*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - Isolated the cDNA of a novel chloroplast-targeted Phaseolus vulgaris LOX, (**PvLOX6**). This gene is highly induced after wounding, non-host pathogen infection, and by signaling molecules as H2O2, SA, ethylene and MeJA.
   - The phylogenetic analysis of **PvLOX6** showed that it is closely related to chloroplast-targeted LOX from potato (H1) and tomato (TomLOXC); both of them are implicated in the biosynthesis of C6 volatiles.
   - Induction of **PvLOX6** mRNA by wounding ethylene and jasmonic acid on the one side, and non-host pathogen, salicylic acid on the other indicates that common bean uses the same LOX to synthesize oxylipins in response to different stresses.
   - **PvLOX6** was included in this clade. On the basis of this observation it is suggested that this enzyme participates in the biosynthesis of C6 volatiles.
