## Gene Details:
- **Gene ID:** []()
- **Gene Symbol:** <u>PsMLO1</u>
- **Gene Name:** mildew resistance locus O gene 1
- **Genome:** 
- **Species:** *Pisum sativum*

## Functional Descriptions:
   - The observed resistance in Yunwan 8 plants resulted from a point mutation (C â†’ G) at position 680 of **PsMLO1** that introduced a stop codon, leading to premature termination of protein synthesis.
   - Powdery mildew resistance in Yunwan 21 and Yunwan 23 plants was caused by identical insertions or deletions in **PsMLO1**.
   - Additionally, the **PsMLO1** cDNA sequences in Yunwan 21 and Yunwan 23 plants contained a frame shift associated with a 5-bp deletion.
   - It was reported that resistance conferred by er1 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in a powdery mildew susceptibility gene, **PsMLO1**, belonging to the mildew resistance locus O (MLO) gene family.
