## Overview
### Analysis Name:Gossypium barbadense (AD2) '3-79' genome HAU_v1
### Method:SOAPdenovo (2)
### Source:Illumina paired-end (insert size of ~500 bp) and mate-pair (insert size of 5, 10 and 20 kb)
### About the assembly:
Here, we report the genome sequence of the superior fibre quality tetraploid cotton, G. barbadense acc. 3-79 using a whole-genome shotgun approach with large fragments of DNA Paired-End Tag (DNA-PET) sequencing data.  This is a high-quality assembly of the 2.57 gigabase genome of G. barbadense, including 80,876 protein-coding genes. The double-sized genome of the A (or At) (1.50 Gb) against D (or Dt) (853 Mb) primarily resulted from the expansion of Gypsy elements, including Peabody and Retrosat2 subclades in the Del clade, and the Athila subclade in the Athila/Tat clade. Substantial gene expansion and contraction were observed and rich homoeologous gene pairs with biased expression patterns were identified, suggesting abundant gene sub-functionalization occurred by allopolyploidization. More specifically, the CesA gene family has adapted differentially temporal expression patterns, suggesting an integrated regulatory mechanism of CesA genes from At and Dt subgenomes for the primary and secondary cellulose biosynthesis of cotton fibre in a “relay race”-like fashion. It is anticipated that the G. barbadense genome sequence will advance the understanding of the mechanism of genome polyploidization and underpin genome-wide comparison research in this genus.
