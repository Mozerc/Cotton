## Overview
### Analysis Name	:Gossypium anomalum (B1) genome NSF_v1
### Method	:PacBio, Hi-C
### Source	:(v1)
We report a high-quality de novo genome assembly for G. anomalum (B1). This genome was initially assembled using 55x coverage of PacBio reads, yielding a draft assembly of 229 contigs with an N50 of 11 Mb. HiC reads (140.5 million) were integrated to the final, contiguous assembly, consisting of 13 chromosomes with an average length of 92 Mb and containing only 20.7 kb (0.002%) gap sequence within the chromosomal scaffolds. The total assembly is composed of 68 contigs (including the 13 chromosomal scaffolds) with a total length of 1193 Mb, ~88% of the estimated 1359 Mb genome (Hendrix and Stewart 2005).
