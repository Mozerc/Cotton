## Overview
### Analysis Name:Gossypium barbadense (AD2) '3-79' genome HAU_v2_a1
### Method:Irys Solve (BioNano) (v3.2)
### Source:Illumina paired-end, PacBio and BioNano
### About the Assembly:

Single-molecule real-time sequencing technology (PacBio RSII) was applied to assemble de novo the genome sequence of G. barbadense accession 3–79, generated 210.98 Gb of genome sequence with an estimated depth of coverage of at least 80× for the genome.  Illumina paired-end data was used to correct low-quality nucleotides and insertions/deletions (InDels) from the PacBio sequencing. These polished contigs were processed for a hybrid assembly by using high-resolution optical mapping (BioNano Genomics Irys) data from the same accessions. To construct chromosome-scale scaffolds, we used high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data from each accession to categorize and order these assemblies obtained by optical mapping.
