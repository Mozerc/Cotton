## Overview
### Analysis Name:	Gossypium anomalum (B1) genome JAAS_v1.2_a1.1
### Method	:PacBio, Hi-C
### Source	:(v1.2)
### About the assembly:
We generated 82.68 Gb (~64×) of high-quality long reads using the Pacbio SMART platform. After correction using 132.61 Gb (~103×) Illumina paired-end data, the long Pacbio reads were assembled into 611 contigs that captured 1.20 Gb of the G. anomalum genome, and of which 363 were too short (total length of Journal Pre-proof 9.35 Mb) to be then validated and scaffolded using BioNano optical maps. A total of 249,816,916 valid high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) valid reads were used to categorize, order, and orient these scaffolds. The final assembly comprised 364 scaffolds (N50 = 99.19 Mb), spanning 1.21 Gb and accounting for ~93.66% of the estimated genome (total size 1.29 Gb based on K-mer distribution analysis and 1.35 Gb by flow cytometry analysis), of which 351 were short scaffolds (total length of 9.58 Mb), and 13 super-scaffolds represent the complete set of G. anomalum pseudo-chromosomes and comprised 99.21% of the total assembled sequence.
