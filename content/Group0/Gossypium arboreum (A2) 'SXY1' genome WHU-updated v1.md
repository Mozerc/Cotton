## Overview
### Analysis Name:Gossypium arboreum (A2) 'SXY1' genome WHU-updated v1
### Method:Ultra-depth PacBio long-reads and Hi-C technologies
### Source:Garboreum_Shixiya1_WHUv3.0rc.genome.standard
### About the assembly:
The new assembly of Gossypium arboreum genome (cultivar Shi Xi Ya 1) was released from the Institute for Advanced Studies, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China (IAS-WHU). The assembly were sequenced using high-depth SMRT long reads resulting in 177-fold genome coverage (~310 Gb). The genome assembly was corrected by using accurate Illumina paired-end reads. Finally, 92.18% of total contigs spanning 1,509 Mb were categorized and ordered into 13 chromosome-scale scaffolds using Hi-C data. Compared with first draft genome of G. arboreum in 2014 (Li, F. et al., Nature Genetics 46, 567-572 (2014)) and genome update of G. arboreum in 2018 (Du, X. et al., Nature Genetics 50, 796-802 (2018)), the new genome assembly has substantial improvements with high completeness and accuracy. In addition, the new assembly filled a lot of genome gaps existed in two previous assemblies. The new assembly also showed high congruence and good collinear relationships in quantity among cotton genomes. Our continuing efforts to assemble the high-resolution and chromosome-scale G. arboreum reference genome will further facilitate the translation of genomics to cotton breeding and genetics.
