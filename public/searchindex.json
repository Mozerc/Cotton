GaJAZ1can interact with GaMYC2 to repress expression of downstream genes whose promoters contain a G-box cis element, affecting plant tolerance to salinity stress. High-throughput RNA sequencing of GaJAZ1 transgenic and wild-type plants showed many differentially expressed genes involved in JA signaling and biosynthesis, salt stress-related genes, and hormone-related genes, suggesting that overexpressing GaJAZ1 can reprogram the expression of defense-related genes in G. hirsutum plants to increase tolerance to salt stress. Overexpressed GaJAZ1 significantly increased salt tolerance in upland cotton compared to the wild type, showing higher growth vigor with taller plants, increased fresh weight, and more bolls, which is due to reprogrammed expression of tolerance-related genes and promotion of root development.

Discovered that the expression level of GbCML45 was promoted after V. dahliae infection in roots of cotton, suggesting its potential role in Verticillium wilt resistance. Knockdown of GbCML45 in cotton plants decreased resistance while overexpression of GbCML45 in Arabidopsis thaliana plants enhanced resistance to V. dahliae infection.

Of the ROS-related proteins identified, we further characterized a thioredoxin, GbNRX1, which increased in abundance in response to V. dahliae challenge, finding that GbNRX1 functions in apoplastic ROS scavenging after the ROS burst that occurs upon recognition of V. dahliae. As a result, the Gb NRX 1-silenced plants showed reduced wilt resistance, indicating that the initial defense response in the root apoplast requires the antioxidant activity of GbNRX1. Our results demonstrate that apoplastic ROS generation and scavenging occur in tandem in response to pathogen attack; also, the rapid balancing of redox to maintain homeostasis after the ROS burst, which involves GbNRX1, is critical for the apoplastic immune response.

  "content":"Gene Details: Gene ID: Gene Symbol: Gh4CL7 Gene Name: Genome: Species: Gossypium hirsutum Functional Descriptions: The Gh4CL7-silencing cotton plants showed more sensitive to drought stress, probably due to decreased relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll content and antioxidative enzyme activity, increased stomatal aperture, and the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Arabidopsis lines overexpressing Gh4CL7, however, were more tolerant to drought treatment, which was associated with improved antioxidative enzyme activity, reduced accumulation of MDA and H2O2 and up-regulated stress-related genes under the drought stress conditions. The Gh4CL7-silencing cotton plants and the Gh4CL7-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines had a ~20% reduction and a ~10% increase in lignin content, respectively. These results demonstrated that Gh4CL7 could positively respond to drought stress and therefore might be a candidate gene for improvement of drought tolerance in cotton.

High levels of GhACS1 activity are crucial for fatty acid metabolism in PSCs, PMCs, microspores and particularly tapetal cells. Reduction of ACS enzymatic activity by suppressing GhACS1 expression severely affected the tapetal cells and consequently blocked normal microsporogenesis in early anther development. As a result, the transgenic plants failed to produce functional pollen grains and were male-sterile, suggesting that the GhACS1 gene is required for normal microsporogenesis in early anther development of cotton.

GhACS2 is also specifically expressed in the anther. Its expression level, however, was about 100-fold lower than that of GhACS1. Our data indicated that the GhACS1 expression was suppressed to very low levels in the male-sterile transgenic anthers examined but GhACS2 expression remained unaltered in these plants.

Silencing of GhAPL and GhHDA5 delayed the flowering time and increased the NFFB compared to those of VA plants in cotton. Our study preliminarily found that GhAPL and GhHDA5 are related to the early maturity in cotton. The findings provide a basis for the further functional verification of candidate genes related to the NFFB and contribute to the study of early maturity in cotton.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses showed that GhAPX1 was highly expressed in wild-type 5-d postanthesis fibres with much lower transcript levels in the fuzzless-lintless mutant ovules. Treating in vitro cultured wild-type cotton ovules with exogenous H2O2 or ethylene induced the expression of GhAPX1 and hence increased total APX activity proportionally, followed by extended fibre cell elongation.

Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that the GhARF16-1 and GhKNOX2-1 genes might be potential regulators of leaf shape. Overexpression of GhARF16-1 led to the up-regulation of GhKNOX2-1 and resulted in more and deeper serrations in cotton leaves, similar to the leaf shape of cotton plants overexpressing GhKNOX2-1.

  "content":"Gene Details: Gene ID: Gh_A09G122000 Gene Symbol: GhCaM7 Gene Name: Genome: Species: Gossypium hirsutum Functional Descriptions: GhCaM7 is acetylated upon Verticillium dahliae (V. dahliae) infection and a positive regulator of V. dahliae resistance. Overexpressing GhCaM7 in cotton and Arabidopsis enhances V. dahliae resistance and knocking-down GhCaM7 makes cotton more susceptible to V. dahliae. GhCaM7 and GhOSM34 are co-localized in the cell membrane. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing GhCaM7 with mutation at the acetylation site are more susceptible to V. dahliae than transgenics overexpressing the wild-type GhCaM7, implying the importance of the acetylated GhCaM7 in response to V. dahliae infection. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescent complementation, luciferase complementation imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated interaction between GhCaM7 and an osmotin protein GhOSM34 that was shown to have a positive role in V. dahliae resistance. Comparative transcriptomic analyses between cotton plants with an increased or reduced expression level of GhCaM7 and wild-type plants indicate the involvement of jasmonic acid signaling pathways and reactive oxygen species in GhCaM7-enabled disease resistance.

A gene encoding a calcium sensor, GhCaM7, was isolated based on its high expression level relative to other GhCaMs in fiber cells at the fast elongation stage. Overexpressing GhCaM7 promotes early fiber elongation, whereas GhCaM7 suppression by RNAi delays fiber initiation and inhibits fiber elongation. We conclude that GhCaM7, Ca2+ and ROS are three important regulators involved in early fiber elongation.

Knockout of GHCU or its homolog in cotton and tobacco using CRISPR results in abnormal leaf shape. It is further discovered that GHCU facilitates the transport of the HD protein KNOTTED1-like (KNGH1) from the adaxial to the abaxial domain. Loss of GHCU function restricts KNGH1 to the adaxial epidermal region, leading to lower auxin response levels in the adaxial boundary compared to the abaxial. This spatial asymmetry in auxin distribution produces the upward-curled leaf phenotype of the cu mutant. Overall, these findings suggest that GHCU plays a crucial role in the regulation of leaf flattening through facilitating cell-to-cell trafficking of KNGH1 and hence influencing the auxin response level. GHCU and its homologs are key in regulating cell enlargement and arrangement on the abaxial epidermis during leaf development.

GhGalT1, belonging to CAZy GT31 family, is the type II membrane protein that contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal galactosyltransferase functional domain. A subcellular localization assay demonstrated that GhGalT1 was localized in the Golgi apparatus. The cotton β-galactosyltransferase 1 (GalT1) that galactosylates arabinogalactan proteins participates in controlling fiber development. Characterized the role of a CAZy glycosyltransferase 31 (GT31) family member, GhGalT1, in cotton fiber development. The fiber length of the transgenic cotton overexpressing GhGalT1 was shorter than that of the wild type, whereas in the GhGalT1-silenced lines there was a notable increase in fiber length compared with wild type. We also show that GhGalT1 can form homo- and heterodimers with other cotton GT31 family members to facilitate AG glycan assembly of AGPs. Thus, our data demonstrate that GhGalT1 influences cotton fiber development via controlling the glycosylation of AGPs, especially FLAs.

Both proteomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed that contrary to GhGLU19-overexpressing lines, the glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism was decreased, and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis related genes were downregulated in imbibed seeds of GhGLU19-suppressing lines. Endogenous ABA was significantly decreased in GhGLU19-suppressing line while increased in GhGLU19-overexpressing line.

ND601. GhGPA plays a vital role in Verticillium wilt resistance by inducing SA and JA signaling pathways and regulating the production of reactive oxygen species. These findings not only broaden our knowledge about the biological role of GhGPA, but also shed light on the defense mechanisms involving GhGPA against V. dahliae in cotton. The G-protein α subunit GhGPA positively regulates Gossypium hirsutum resistance to Verticillium dahliae via induction of SA and JA signaling pathways and ROS accumulation. GhGPA transcription was up-regulated under V. dahliae stress, with higher expression in tolerant than in susceptible cotton cultivars.

Characterized a JAZ family protein, GhJAZ2, from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) which was induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and inoculation of Verticillium dahliae. The overexpression of GhJAZ2 in cotton impairs the sensitivity to JA, decreases the expression level of JA-response genes (GhPDF1.2 and GhVSP) and enhances the susceptibility to V. dahliae and insect herbivory. Molecular and genetic evidence shows that GhJAZ2 can interact with GhbHLH171 and inhibit its transcriptional activity and, as a result, can restrain the JA-mediated defence response. GhJAZ2 reduces methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced anthocyanin accumulation and the expression of jasmonate (JA)-responsive defence marker genes in cotton.

GhKNL1 was localized in the cell nucleus, and could interact with GhOFP4, as well as AtOFP1, AtOFP4, and AtMYB75. Dominant repression of GhKNL1 affected fibre development of cotton. The expression levels of genes related to fibre elongation and SCW biosynthesis were altered in transgenic fibres of cotton. As a result, transgenic cotton plants produced aberrant, shrunken, and collapsed fibre cells. Complementation revealed that GhKNL1 rescued the defective phenotype of Arabidopsis knat7 mutant in some extent. These data suggest that GhKNL1, as a transcription factor, participates in regulating fibre development of cotton.

GhMKK5, from cotton belonging to the group C MAPKKs was isolated and characterized. The expression of GhMKK5 can be induced by pathogen infection, abiotic stresses, and multiple defence-related signal molecules. The overexpression of GhMKK5 in Nicotiana benthamiana enhanced the plants’ resistance to the bacterial pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum by elevating the expression of pathogen resistance (PR) genes, including PR1a, PR2, PR4, PR5, and NPR1, but increased the plants’ sensitivity to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica var. nicotianae Tucker. GhMKK5-overexpressing plants displayed markedly elevated expression of reactive oxygen species-related and cell death marker genes, such as NtRbohA and NtCDM, and resulted in hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death characterized by the accumulation of H2O2.

Identified a defense-related major latex protein (MLP) from upland cotton (designated GhMLP28) and investigated its functional mechanism. GhMLP28 transcripts were ubiquitously present in cotton plants, with higher accumulation in the root. Expression of the GhMLP28 gene was induced by Verticillium dahliae inoculation and was responsive to defense signaling molecules, including ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid. Knockdown of GhMLP28 expression by virus-induced gene silencing resulted in increased susceptibility of cotton plants to V. dahliae infection, while ectopic overexpression of GhMLP28 in tobacco improved the disease tolerance of the transgenic plants.

Analysis of genes co-expressed with GhMYB1 showed that it potentially regulates a number of other 19–25 DPA-specific genes in networks including those functioning in the cell wall and precursor synthesis. GhMYB1 was expressed specifically in fibre from 19 DPA, overlapping with the sharp rise in GhGDSL expression, indicating that it could regulate GhGDSL during fibre development.

RNA-seq and protein−DNA binding assays revealed that GhMYB212 was closely linked to the pathways of sucrose and starch transportation and metabolism, directly controling the expression of a sucrose transporter gene GhSWEET12. GhMYB212 RNAi plants (GhMYB212i) accumulated less sucrose and glucose in developing fibers, and had shorter fibers and a lower lint index. Current investigations support the idea that GhMYB212 functions as the main regulator of fiber elongation by controlling the expression of GhSWEET12, and therefore it is important to study cell expansion and sugar transportation during seed development.

GhJAZ2 negatively regulated fiber initiation via interacting with GhMYB25-like.

GhnsLTPsA10 played antagonistic roles in positively regulating VW and Fusarium wilt resistance and negatively mediating aphid and bollworm resistance in transgenic Arabidopsis and silenced cotton. The novel function of GhnsLTP and the molecular association between disease resistance and insect resistance, balanced by GhnsLTPsA10. GhnsLTPsA10 contributed to reactive oxygen species accumulation. This broadens our knowledge of the biological function of GhnsLTPsA10 in crops and provides a useful locus for genetic improvement of cotton.

  "content":"Gene Details: Gene ID: Gene Symbol: GhPSK Gene Name: Phytosulfokine-α Genome: Species: Gossypium arboreum Functional Descriptions: A peptide hormone gene, GhPSK promotes fibre elongation and contributes to longer and finer cotton fibre. A putative PSK gene (GhPSK) was cloned from Gossypium hirsutum. Expression pattern analysis revealed that GhPSK is preferentially expressed in rapidly elongating fibre cells (5–20 days postanthesis). Overexpression of GhPSK in cotton increased the endogenous PSK-α level and promoted cotton fibre cell elongation, resulting in longer and finer fibres. Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis of GhPSK overexpression lines indicates that PSK signalling may regulate the respiratory electron-transport chain and reactive oxygen species to affect cotton fibre development.

Genetic knockout of GhRCD1 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology resulted in reduced Cd2+ tolerance in cotton seedlings, while GhRCD1 overexpression enhanced Cd2+ tolerance. These findings provide critical insights into a novel GhRCD1–GhbHLH12–GhMYB44–GhHMA1 regulatory module responsible for Cd2+ tolerance in cotton. GhRCD1 plays a vital role in Cd2+ tolerance, whereby genetic attenuation of GhRCD1 expression resulted in Cd2+ hypersensitivity, whereas the overexpression of GhRCD1 enhanced Cd2+ tolerance in cotton.

Expression of either GhRDL1 or GhEXPA1 alone in Arabidopsis led to a substantial increase in seed size| interestingly, their co-expression resulted in the increased number of siliques, the nearly doubled seed mass, and the enhanced biomass production. Cotton plants overexpressing GhRDL1 and GhEXPA1 proteins produced strikingly more fruits (bolls), leading to up to 40% higher fiber yield per plant without adverse effects on fiber quality and vegetative growth. Overall, data collected from the two field trials demonstrated that co-overexpression of GhRDL1 and GhEXPA1 in cotton promoted boll production and cotton fiber yield, without adverse effects on either vegetative growth or fiber quality.

Silencing of GhSPMS or GhSAMDC in cotton leaves led to a significant accumulation of upstream substrates and, ultimately, enhanced plant susceptibility to Verticillium infection. When compared with the wild type (WT), constitutive expression of GhSAMDC in Arabidopsis thaliana was associated with greater Verticillium wilt resistance and higher accumulations of Spm, salicylic acid, and leucine during the infection period. Together, these results suggest that GhSAMDC-, rather than GhSPMS-, mediated spermine biosynthesis contributes to plant resistance against V. dahliae through SA- and leucine-correlated signaling.

Silencing of GhSPMS or GhSAMDC in cotton leaves led to a significant accumulation of upstream substrates and, ultimately, enhanced plant susceptibility to Verticillium infection. When compared with the wild type (WT), constitutive expression of GhSAMDC in Arabidopsis thaliana was associated with greater Verticillium wilt resistance and higher accumulations of Spm, salicylic acid, and leucine during the infection period. Together, these results suggest that GhSAMDC-, rather than GhSPMS-, mediated spermine biosynthesis contributes to plant resistance against V. dahliae through SA- and leucine-correlated signaling.

By association analysis, GhSusA1 was highly correlated with fiber qualities in (7235× TM-1) recombinant inbred lines based on polymorphism of GhSusA1 between 7235 and TM-1. Suppression of GhSusA1 in transgenic cotton reduced fiber quality and decreased the boll size and seed weight. Importantly, overexpression of this gene increased fiber length and strength, with the latter indicated by the enhanced thickening of cell wall during secondary wall formation stage. Increasing GhSusA1 transcript abundance in vegetative tissues led to elevated seedling biomass. Together, these findings identified GhSusA1 as a key regulator of sink strength in cotton, which is tightly associated with productivity, and hence a promising candidate gene that can be developed to increase cotton fiber yield and quality.

The internal molecular connections between the sucrose transporting activity of GhSWEET12 for promoting cell expansion, the sucrose contents in fiber cells at different developing phases and cotton fiber phenotypes.

GhWRKY17 was found to be induced after exposure to drought, salt, H2O2 and ABA. The constitutive expression of GhWRKY17 in Nicotiana benthamiana remarkably reduced plant tolerance to drought and salt stress, as determined through physiological analyses of the germination rate, root growth, survival rate, leaf water loss and Chl content. GhWRKY17 transgenic plants were observed to be more sensitive to ABA-mediated seed germination and root growth. Overexpressing GhWRKY17 in N. benthamiana impaired ABA-induced stomatal closure. Furthermore, we found that GhWRKY17 modulated the increased sensitivity of plants to drought by reducing the level of ABA, and transcript levels of ABA-inducible genes, including AREB, DREB, NCED, ERD and LEA, were clearly repressed under drought and salt stress conditions.

Overexpression of GhWRKY27 in Arabidopsis promoted leaf senescence, as determined by reduced chlorophyll content and elevated expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs). The expression of GhRipen2–2 was significantly induced during leaf senescence and activated by GhWRKY27, suggesting its potential roles in leaf senescence and ageing regulatory pathways.

GhZFP1 contains two typical zinc finger motifs (Cx8Cx5Cx3H and Cx5Cx4Cx3H), a putative nuclear export sequence (NES) and a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS). RNA blot analysis showed that the GhZFP1 transcript was induced by salt (NaCl), drought and salicylic acid (SA). The regions in GhZFP1 that interact with GZIRD21A and GZIPR5 were identified using truncation mutations.

GoPGF directly activates the expression of JAVL, whereas JAVL suppresses GoPGF transcription, establishing a negative feedback loop that maintains the expression homeostasis between GoPGF and JAVL. It is observed that JAVL negatively regulates jasmonate levels by inhibiting the expression of jasmonate biosynthetic genes and interacting with GoPGF to attenuate its activation effects, thereby maintaining homeostatic regulation of jasmonate levels. The increased expression ratio of GoPGF to JAVL leads to enlarged pigment glands and elevated jasmonates and defense compounds, enhancing insect and pathogen resistance in cotton.

GoSTR functions as a master repressor for stem trichome formation, which was isolated by map-based cloning based on a large F2 segregating population derived from a cross between TM-1 (pubescent stem) and J220 (smooth stem). Silencing of GoSTR in J220 and Hai7124 via virus-induced gene silencing resulted in the pubescent stems but no visible change in leaf trichomes, suggesting stem trichomes and leaf trichomes are genetically distinct. These results indicate that GoSTR functions as an essential negative modulator of stem trichomes and its transcripts will greatly repress trichome cell differentiation and growth. Function-related keywords: leaf , stem , growth , stems , map-based-cloning , virus Literature: GoSTR, a negative modulator of stem trichome formation in cotton.

  "content":"Gene Details: Gene ID: Gene Symbol: WLIM1a Gene Name: LIM domain protein LIM-2 Genome: Species: Gossypium hirsutum Functional Descriptions: The Dual Functions of WLIM1a in Cell Elongation and Secondary Wall Formation in Developing Cotton Fibers. Demonstrate dual roles of the WLIM1a gene in fiber development in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). WLIM1a is preferentially expressed during the elongation and secondary wall synthesis stages in developing fibers. Overexpression of WLIM1a in cotton led to significant changes in fiber length and secondary wall structure. Compared with the wild type, fibers of WLIM1a-overexpressing plants grew longer and formed a thinner and more compact secondary cell wall, which contributed to improved fiber strength and fineness. Taken together, these results demonstrate that WLIM1a has dual roles in cotton fiber development, elongation, and secondary wall formation. Moreover, our study shows that lignin/lignin-like phenolics may substantially affect cotton fiber quality| this finding may guide cotton breeding for improved fiber traits.
